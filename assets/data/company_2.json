By HANNAH BROWN APRIL 14, 2025 13:50 A scene from 'Alex is Lovesick.' (photo credit: YES) The Israeli Movie Channel on Yes is featuring a tribute to Yitzhak Shani, one of Israel\u2019s great veteran movie producers, on his 90th birthday, which falls on April 14. On April 19, it will screen several of his films in an all-day program. Shani, who started out as author/director Ephraim Kishon\u2019s lawyer and produced many of the beloved Israeli classics of the 1980s and earlier, now owns the Lev Cinemas chain . The channel will show Alex is Lovesick (1986), directed by Boaz Davidson, arguably Shani\u2019s most famous film, in its Private Screening series, where the producer will watch his film and comment on it. This dramedy tells the story of a boy (Eitan Sneh), growing up in a typical Polish family in Israel in the 1950s. He falls for his Aunt Lola (Sharon Hacohen), who arrives from Europe to search for her lost love. Yosef Shiloach plays the family\u2019s kooky tenant. Another classic Shani produced, also directed by Davidson, is Azit, the Paratrooper Dog (1972), which will also be included in the tribute. Azit is a friendly neighborhood dog with military training who ends up going behind enemy lines to rescue soldiers from terrorists. They really don\u2019t make them like this anymore. If your children are not too jaded to watch a movie that doesn\u2019t have great production values by today\u2019s standards and is generally a bit dated, you should introduce them to this film. It\u2019s a must for dog lovers. Hacks \u2013 Hot VOD, Next TV, Yes VOD, Sting+ If you\u2019re trying to figure out what to watch now at the end of season three of The White Lotus, the most uncannily engrossing series in recent years, there are a few options on the horizon. Season four of Hacks is coming up on Hot VOD, Next TV, Yes VOD, and Sting+ starting April 11, and the series will be broadcast on Saturdays starting April 12 on Hot 3 at 10 p.m. Hacks is a comedy series about Deborah Vance (Jean Smart), a pioneering female stand-up, and her 25-year-old writer, Ava (Hannah Einbinder), who has been canceled for an ill-considered quip. The two have ratcheted up the tension between them higher than ever now that Ava managed to secure the head writer job on Deborah\u2019s new late-night show at the end of the previous season. I wasn\u2019t really sure at the end of the third season that we needed another one, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed Smart in this role, for which she has won three Emmys. Jon Hamm in 'Your Friends & Neighbors.' (credit: Apple TV+) The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Last of Us \u2013 Hot, Next, Yes I stopped watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale back in season two, when a character I liked had some body part amputated and all the torture became too relentless, but it has a loyal following, and the first episode of season six, the final one, has just started running on Wednesdays on Hot 3 and is also on Hot VOD and Next TV. If zombie shows that aren\u2019t really about the zombies are your thing, the second season of The Last of Us is coming to Cellcom TV, Hot HBO, Hot VOD, and Next TV, and Yes VOD and Sting+ on April 14. There\u2019s a five-year time jump between the end of the previous season and the new one, and a few twists in store for fans. Your Friends and Neighbors \u2013 Apple TV+ \u201cYou have this very strange mix of confidence and low self-esteem,\u201d says a young woman to Jon Hamm , who plays Coop, the hero of Your Friends and Neighbors, in the opening episode of the new series, which starts streaming on Apple TV+ on April 11. She could be describing Don Draper, the anti-hero Hamm portrayed on Mad Men, one of the gems of television\u2019s new golden age. It seems strange to think that in May, it will be a full decade since that series ended its run, and Hamm seemed poised for superstardom. But over the last decade, this comedian in the body of a leading man has stuck mainly to capers, such the Fletch movies, and comedies, like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, as well as voice acting for cartoons. Your Friends and Neighbors is mostly a caper series, recycling the trope that people seem to love \u2013 about middle-class people (or in this case, upper middle-class ones) who are forced into a life of crime to support themselves the way they\u2019re used to being after they suffer a reversal of fortune. That was the basic story behind Weeds, Ozark, Good Girls, and so many other movies and series. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now In this series, Coop is a hedge-fund manager reeling from a divorce after his wife (Amanda Peet) cheats on him with a friend. He makes the mistake of having a one-night stand with a young woman who works at his company. Faster than you can polish a Rolex, his smarmy boss (Corbin Bernsen, who played Arnie Becker on L.A. Law) fires him and freezes his stock options, reminding him that he can\u2019t work for any competing firms for two years. At a garden party, he wanders through the home of one of his neighbors and realizes how much expensive stuff they have just lying around. It\u2019s hard to imagine that someone could have so many watches that cost $200,000 that they won\u2019t notice if one is missing, but according to this series, that\u2019s the case. Soon, he is grabbing up some of these luxury goods and selling them to a tough-talking Bronx grandmother (Randy Danson) who runs a pawnshop, and trying to figure out how much more he needs to sell to get by. He also has to figure out what\u2019s going on with his on-again, off-again girlfriend (Olivia Munn of The Newsroom, who has been very ill with cancer for a couple of years but who looks great here). Mad Men fans will recall that no one is better than Jon Hamm at playing resentful befuddlement, and he gives it his all here. The writing in the series aims high, for the snappiness of legendary crime writer Elmore Leonard, but can\u2019t make it and the script is talky and obvious. At least a lot of the dialogue is delivered in Hamm\u2019s laidback, sexy voice. A Complete Unknown, The Substance \u2013 buy or rent If you enjoyed the recent Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, and know that you\u2019ll want to see it again, it\u2019s already available to buy on Apple TV+ for about the same price as a movie ticket, and will be available to rent in May at a lower price. Another movie you may have missed in theaters, The Substance, can be rented on Apple now. It\u2019s a horror movie about the lengths a washed-up former movie star, played memorably by Demi Moore, will go to look younger. She gets a tip that she should inject herself with the titular substance, which will make her look like Margaret Qualley for seven days, and then she\u2019ll go back to being herself for another week. Soon, her younger self decides to stop sharing the spotlight and all hell breaks loose.

Despite a 3% market growth in Q1, Counterpoint Research anticipates a market decline this year due to economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump. Reuters Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday. Counterpoint expects the smartphone market to decline this year, due to economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump. Trump's back-and-forth tariffs and escalation of global trade tensions has resulted in a worsening economic outlook and the possibility of stronger inflation. A volatile macroeconomic environment can cause consumers to postpone the purchase of mobile phones, unsettling the supply chain and increasing trade risks which can negatively impact the market, the report said. \"As per our current estimates, the tariff announcement did not lead to a major demand increase because of the uncertainty around tariffs and policy. Since Tariffs were announced in April, it did not impact iPhone demand in Q1 2025,\" said Ankit Malhotra, senior research analyst at Counterpoint. Live Events The global smartphone market grew 3% in the first quarter of 2025, but Counterpoint expects the overall market to decline this year. Samsung followed Apple with 18% market share. Xiaomi also continued its sales momentum while vivo took the fourth spot and OPPO came in at fifth.

Writing in his latest Power On newsletter , Gurman says that upcoming new versions of Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset are a \"stepping stone\" towards Cook's ultimate decade-long goal of making AR glasses \u2013 lightweight spectacles that users can wear all day and which overlay graphics on the real world. Cook has apparently made the glasses a \"top priority\" for the company. \"Tim cares about nothing else,\" Gurman quotes a person with knowledge of the matter as saying. \"It's the only thing he's really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.\" Meta is currently developing true AR glasses, and has already prototyped a version of the device it envisions bringing to mass market, dubbed Orion . Gurman notes that it will take \"many years\" for true AR glasses to be ready, with several technologies still needing to be perfected, including high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip, and a tiny battery that can provide all-day power. Meta's non-AR Ray-Ban glasses have reportedly been a surprise hit. These glasses are for taking pictures and conversing with an AI assistant. Apple is said to have discussed the possibility of making similar glasses to compete in the same space. Apple's rationale seems to be that creating smart glasses could be a precursor to developing true AR glasses further in the future. Apple is also said to be adding AI-enabled cameras to the Apple Watch and AirPods over the next couple of years. There have been rumors about Apple's work on AR glasses \u2013 aka Apple Glass \u2013 for almost 10 years now , and the Vision Pro headset is what Apple built because the technology doesn't yet exist for the kind of augmented reality glasses that Apple is aiming for. Gurman has previously reported that Apple is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces, and that the company is working on a version of visionOS that will run on glasses.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Counterpoint expects the smartphone market to decline this year, due to economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump. Trump's back-and-forth tariffs and escalation of global trade tensions has resulted in a worsening economic outlook and the possibility of stronger inflation. A volatile macroeconomic environment can cause consumers to postpone the purchase of mobile phones, unsettling the supply chain and increasing trade risks which can negatively impact the market, the report said. KEY QUOTE \"As per our current estimates, the tariff announcement did not lead to a major demand increase because of the uncertainty around tariffs and policy. Since Tariffs were announced in April, it did not impact iPhone demand in Q1 2025,\" said Ankit Malhotra, senior research analyst at Counterpoint. BY THE NUMBERS The global smartphone market grew 3 per cent in the first quarter of 2025, but Counterpoint expects the overall market to decline this year. Samsung followed Apple with 18 per cent market share. Xiaomi also continued its sales momentum while vivo took the fourth spot and OPPO came in at fifth.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : Apple is facing two class-action lawsuits in the US and Canada over its delayed AI-powered Siri features, after hyping them in ads and pushing iPhone 16 upgrades. Behind the scenes, reports reveal Apple\u2019s Siri demos were largely fictional, with internal chaos and budget cuts leaving the assistant far from ready. When Apple first introduced Siri, it was supposed to be one of the company\u2019s crowning jewels. A smart digital assistant that could do all sorts of things on behalf of the user. These days, Siri is starting to become a liability as Apple is facing more lawsuits over the delayed Siri features it promised. Siri lawsuits After promising a shiny, AI-powered version of Siri under Apple Intelligence, the company ended up delaying the entire rollout to next year. Naturally, this didn\u2019t sit well with iPhone 16 buyers. Many upgraded their devices, expecting to use these new features right away. As it turns out, they\u2019ll be waiting an entire year to see what Apple\u2019s revamped voice assistant can actually do. That frustration has now exploded into not one but two class-action lawsuits. In the US, two plaintiffs claim they were misled by Apple\u2019s aggressive marketing. They are saying they would never have bought the iPhone 16 if they knew the Siri upgrades were vaporware. Over in Canada, a separate lawsuit is playing out in British Columbia, making similar allegations of false advertising. Apple even pulled an ad featuring Bella Ramsey hyping up the new Siri. Both lawsuits are now demanding damages. If the courts side with the plaintiffs, Apple could be on the hook for payouts to every iPhone 16 owner who bought the device expecting the next-gen Siri experience. Apple\u2019s Siri woes It\u2019s very worrying to see Apple headed down this path. A report by The Information reveals the chaos behind the scenes that landed Apple in this mess. For starters, the Siri demos Apple showed to the public were more or less a work of fiction. The marketing team apparently did not consult with the team working on Siri. The Siri team was surprised to find out about these new features that they were never even working on. It also shows how some of Apple\u2019s senior leaders dismissed the utility behind AI like ChatGPT. At least until it was too late. One report even suggested that when John Giannandrea, Apple\u2019s head of AI, wanted to upgrade the company\u2019s ageing 50,000 GPUs to make it better when it comes to developing AI capabilities, Apple\u2019s finance chief, Luca Maestri, slashed that budget to less than half . This is despite Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, giving it the green light.

And then that excitement turned to bitter recrimination when the company revealed that games for the new system could cost as much as $80, even if you choose a digital rather than physical copy. Oh and then they announced that the April 9 preorders were delayed \u201cto assess the potential impact of tariffs.\u201d This financial bombshell was especially ill-timed because it\u2019s become clear that the Switch 2 is considerably less innovative than its more affordable predecessor. Many of Nintendo\u2019s hits have achieved success thanks to a fun gimmick or point of difference: the DS\u2019s twin screens, the Wii\u2019s motion controls, and the Switch\u2019s twin function as a handheld and big-screen console. Even the Wii U, which flopped, at least attempted something new with its asymmetric controllers. But aside from a cursory (sorry) mouse mode for the Joy-Cons, the Switch 2 appears to just do what the Switch did with better specs. Then again, \u201cdoing the same thing with better specs\u201d is a phrase that could have been written for Apple, especially its all-conquering iPhone product line. Regular readers will be well aware of the exasperating pattern : early rumors hint at a dramatic revamp and startling new features before reality bites and the new iPhone ends up being much the same as the previous model. That certainly appears to be the case this year, with the big redesign predicted earlier in the cycle now looking considerably less radical and the long-awaited shake-up now expected in 2027 . A wide camera module probably isn\u2019t going to be enough for the iPhone 17 to blow your socks off. These increasingly consistent reports about the iPhone 17 arrive, like the Switch 2 price reveal, at an inconvenient time. Because, thanks to on-again, off-again tariffs on goods imported from China, where Apple makes most of its iPhones, the company may have to bite the bullet this year and increase prices or at the very least hike the low end by bumping the starting storage . A 40 percent price bump is a lot easier to swallow if the product is 40 percent better, but if it\u2019s largely the same\u2026 Well, let\u2019s just say that being expensive and boring at the same time is not a good combination. Apple couldn\u2019t realistically have seen this situation coming, but I still feel like this is a crisis of its own making. Year after year, the company has changed the iPhone as little as it possibly can, in order to save money, focus engineering on other projects such as Vision Pro, and leave room for further upgrades in the future. It\u2019s been like an expert racing driver, pushing as close to the barriers as possible for maximum efficiency. But when you do that, you make yourself vulnerable to even the smallest of outside factors, and a political gust of wind just made a crash more likely. Betting against Apple (or Nintendo, for that matter) is a fool\u2019s errand, and my assumption is that Tim Cook will find a way to make this work. He\u2019s already lobbied his way to a temporary exemption , and may yet perform logistical miracles ramping up production in India and Brazil. But above all, I hope Apple will learn its lesson and stop taking iPhone customers for granted. Foundry Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup. We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it\u2019s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too. Have your say We received an interesting and thoughtful response to last week\u2019s Apple Breakfast on the rumored iOS redesign , and I\u2019d like to quote from it here. \u201cYour apprehension toward the anticipated iOS redesign appears to stem from a preference for the familiar,\u201d writes Gregg from Denver, CO. \u201cHowever, embracing change is essential for technological advancement. Consider the evolution of language: languages that fail to adapt risk obsolescence. Latin, once dominant, has faded from common discourse due to its stagnation. Similarly, operating systems must evolve to remain relevant and meet users\u2019 changing needs. \u201cHistorically, iOS redesigns have led to significant improvements. For instance, iOS 7\u2019s overhaul introduced a cleaner, more intuitive interface that many users appreciated. While initial reactions were mixed, the changes ultimately set the stage for future innovations. Furthermore, redesigns can enhance user engagement. Studies have shown that improvements in UX/UI design, such as streamlined navigation and faster load times, can drastically reduce frustration and abandonment, encouraging users to engage more deeply with the operating system. \u201cIn the realm of technology, stagnation is synonymous with decline. As technophiles, we should welcome change that propels us toward more efficient and user-friendly experiences.\u201d Trending: Top stories Next-gen CarPlay is the broken Apple promise that foreshadowed the Siri fiasco .

Do you remember the last time you used a technology that made your head go boom? Boom, as in, \u201cThis changes everything; things will never be the same, and we will use this technology forever?\u201d Is that physical and intellectual feeling that you experience something magical, permanent, and life-changing? I remember the times it\u2019s happened to me. I recall the first time I used an Internet browser. The first time I held a smartphone with apps in my hands. And the first time I connected to the cloud. I\u2019ve been a technologist and entrepreneur for nearly twenty years in Silicon Valley. Boom, I know, doesn\u2019t happen all that often. But it\u2019s happening now. The marvel this time? It\u2019s agentic AI. Agentic AI is an advanced form of artificial intelligence that acts autonomously, making decisions and performing tasks without constant human guidance. It actively works on behalf of businesses while continuously learning and adapting. This goes well beyond the capabilities of more familiar generative AI technology. If you\u2019ve never used it, you\u2019ll experience a boom when you do. I\u2019m convinced agentic AI will have a breakout moment in 2025\u2014the kind that will reverberate for years to come. Here\u2019s why. The Agentic AI Moment What\u2019s happening now in agentic AI feels similar to the early days of cloud computing, when a small group of pioneering companies first recognized its transformative potential. I recognized this in 2009 when I first landed in San Francisco. Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had launched the App Store a few years earlier, and cloud computing was beginning to take shape. By my estimation, there were more than 30,000 independent software vendors (ISVs), but only 100 or so that could be considered truly cloud-native application companies. I marveled at how Salesforce and Workday led the charge and then at how Shopify, Cloudflare, and others followed. What started as a small base of standout cloud-native applications quickly grew into a movement that was to be felt worldwide. The experience taught me to spot signals of transformative change. Unlike previous technological shifts, however, agentic AI grows stronger with each implementation and with each insight shared across the ecosystem. The pioneers who join this movement today won\u2019t just be early adopters\u2014they\u2019ll be the architects of a new era in business technology. Early innovations are emerging, pioneering companies are taking shape and the economic potential is staggering. McKinsey and Co. has estimated that generative AI alone could unlock $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion of value annually. For perspective, that\u2019s larger than the GDPs of Japan and Italy, and nearly twice the size of the global auto industry. The estimated range of total economic potential of AI, which includes analytical AI, machine learning and deep learning, could be $15.5 trillion to $22.9 trillion annually by 2040, according to McKinsey. Why Agentic AI Is The Future Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift on several fronts. This includes how software serves business needs. These systems autonomously handle tasks, make decisions and continuously learn from their environment to optimize outcomes. While current generative AI tools augment human capabilities, agentic AI actively drives outcomes through automated decisions and actions based on dynamic inputs and goals. Consider what this means for business operations. An agentic AI system can analyze sales data and actively pursue qualified leads. It can even engage prospects. It will anticipate bottlenecks in supply chains and automatically implement solutions before issues arise. It will also orchestrate entire marketing campaigns and adjust messaging and targeting as it learns what resonates with each audience segment. In addition to its advanced functionality, the technology is also transforming how innovation is sold. The traditional per-seat software model is evolving towards outcomes-based models that reward actual value creation, not usage. It\u2019s a radical departure that mirrors the very promise of agentic AI: technology that delivers results, not just features. Finally, for all the fear of AI being a job killer, the reality is more nuanced. Consider: According to The World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report 2025, the proportion of tasks completed by humans exclusively is expected to fall to 33% from 47% between 2025 and 2030 . However, the percentage completed by humans assisted by technology is expected to rise to 33% from 30% as businesses improve collaboration between their humans, machines and algorithms. We\u2019re creating unprecedented opportunities for teams to focus on what truly drives business value: strategy, relationships and innovation. Building The Agentic AI Future Which brings me back to \u201cboom.\u201d Booms can be messy, loud and disruptive. Agentic AI is prone to all of these. The rise of agentic AI\u2014AI systems capable of autonomous goal-setting, reasoning and action-taking\u2014faces several challenges that span technological, economic, ethical and practical concerns. These include the following. Agentic AI is tough to manage. Many AI \u201cagents,\u201d for example, struggle with context retention and fail to adapt in complex, open-ended environments. And, unlike traditional AI models, agentic systems are hard to measure since they don\u2019t just generate outputs but interact over time. Also, agentic AI systems don\u2019t always place nicely with legacy systems that are not built for autonomy, adaptability or spontaneity. AI agents can also develop and exhibit behaviors, discriminate unfairly or act in ways that are legally or ethically questionable. Cost is also a consideration. Agentic AI requires extensive training and investment. What is more, agentic AI requires human oversight, debugging and continuous fine-tuning to remain reliable. But the investment is worthwhile. Recently, the research and analyst firm Gartner said agentic AI \u201cwill autonomously resolve 80% of common customer service issues without human intervention by 2029.\u201d The savings that companies that deploy the technology will be immense. With these gains, the opportunity to invest in human capital will be staggering. That\u2019s a boom that should resonate with anyone who uses technology.

Seth Matlins is the Managing Director of the Forbes CMO Network. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 06:30am EDT Updated Apr 14, 2025, 11:59am EDT Share Save For The Entrepreneurial Chief Marketing Officer, Challenging Norms Is the New Norm. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Uncertainty Index, 6 weeks ago, measures of global uncertainty reached their third highest level since monthly tracking began in 2008 , behind only that year\u2019s global economic turmoil and the pandemic. And as any behavioral scientist\u2014or anyone with common sense for that matter\u2014knows, uncertainty clouds and complicates decision making processes and thus the path to purchase and is something other than the optimal macro-context for marketing or marketers. But so it is, and so it makes the need for chief marketers to challenge norms, thinking and doing entrepreneurially and differently, ever more important. What then makes for an entrepreneurial CMO? At Forbes , and as we have for the four years since we created this recognition, we consider the entrepreneurial CMO one who approaches driving growth neither beholden to the status quo nor to disrupting it for the sake of same. We believe the entrepreneurial CMO understands both what has enduring value and what needs to change, whether within their organizations and/or in how they go to market. They are strategic risk-takers, learning and optimizing based on both what works and, inevitably, what doesn\u2019t, believing that failures aren\u2019t failures if you learn from and get better because of them. They see opportunity in constraints and are relentlessly focused on making and doing more with less, no matter how much they might have. Their entrepreneurial approach to marketing challenges assumptions and what\u2019s come and been done before. It\u2019s a mindset that informs their strategies, and evidence of it is often seen through tactical application and activation, the in-market expression of mindset and approach. So too do we recognize the difference between being a great CMO and a great and entrepreneurial one. Not everyone is both and not everyone who is, is both at the same time. A great CMO focuses on what matters most, on what creates and captures demand, and on how to best allocate limited resources to unlimited opportunities. They eschew the rest as distraction and think about the business and their role in driving it strategically and then execute creatively. However, we consider this to be as fundamental as it is essential, and not in and of itself evidence of an entrepreneurial approach. We also recognize that the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d must be considered within the specific context of different industries, categories, companies, and markets. Because that which may be business as usual for company X might be an entirely new way of thinking and doing for company Y, and our judging and selection of the fifty CMOs recognized on this year\u2019s list makes efforts to account for this. It\u2019s our conviction that a status-quo approach to marketing is an increasingly challenged one. It\u2019s our belief that an entrepreneurial take on driving growth and on the art, science, and practice of marketing is and will be increasingly important to great\u2014even good\u2014CMOs, as there is no current reason to think these times of radical uncertainty will become anything but more so in the near-future. As reminder, this particular Forbes list is a one-and-done list, which is to say that once someone has appeared on it, they are no longer eligible for it. This year\u2019s cohort represents the most geographically diverse one yet, and as you read through it (presented alphabetically), you\u2019ll find evidence of an entrepreneurial marketing approach from leaders stewarding brands and companies across categories and the globe. Each is a chief marketer\u2014regardless of their titles\u2014who has been selected from among hundreds of nominees, based on open-nominations, and judged by qualitative consideration from amongst their peers, marketing industry and agency leaders, executive recruiters, CMO list alumni, and Forbes, by whom all final decisions were made. Regardless of what and where they market, it\u2019s how they market and compete that finds them recognized on this 4 th annual Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 list. As in year\u2019s past, we think you\u2019ll find something to learn from each and all of those recognized and invite you to get to know them below. 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 Additional writing and reporting by Laura Ratliffe. Some quotes have been lightly edited for clarity and/or brevity. A-C tk Benji Baer CMO, CBRE FOLLOW Because despite a fundamental, global reset for commercial real estate driven by economic uncertainty, office-norm disruptions, and the continued evolution towards a post-pandemic new normal, Baer\u2019s marketing embraces the disruption that comes from \u201cbreaking models.\u201d Knowing that the times and category require reinvention, Baer and her team have reimagined CBRE\u2019s brand and client experience, marketing\u2019s mission, structure, capabilities, and audiences, and, as she told Forbes , \u201cbuilt a level of accountability the business had not previously experienced.\u201d During her tenure as CMO of the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate services firm, Baer and her team have challenged outdated paradigms and models. At a time when businesses and policymakers are reevaluating how cities function, Baer and her team created the firm\u2019s Shaping Tomorrow\u2019s Cities initiative, positioning CBRE as more than a services provider by urging industry leaders to rethink economic, demographic, and infrastructure challenges. \u201c[Marketing] stepped up to be the ultimate convener, giving a voice\u2014and a platform\u2014to these consequential themes,\u201d Baer tells Forbes . Since its launch, this program alone has doubled the firm\u2019s client engagement. In Q4 2024, CBRE\u2019s reported revenues increased 16% year-over-year (YoY). Linda Bethea Linda Bethea CMO, Danone North America FOLLOW Because Bethea\u2019s focus on \u201cchampioning unorthodox ways of doing things\u201d ensures the company\u2019s marketing remains agile and continually \u201ctweaked\u201d based on performance. With the company since 2020, Bethea has found new ways to solve problems and meet unmet consumer needs with what she describes as a \u201ctest and learn\u201d approach. To these ends, Bethea and her team work to create a culture of learning and risk-taking, embracing what inevitable failures can teach, \u201ccurating a wall of \u2018fame & shame\u2019 highlighting both our successes and failures to help our team become more comfortable with risk-taking.\u201d Examples of Bethea\u2019s unorthodox and entrepreneurial approach include launching ST\u014dK, a \u201cbold\u201d cold-brew brand\u2014not just in partnership with Wrexham AFC but by \u201csponsoring a stadium in a country where the product isn\u2019t sold?\u201d As she asked Forbes , \u201cwhat is bolder than that?\u201d Facing budget declines of 70% for International Delight, a $1B+ portfolio brand, Bethea and her team took an insight\u201475% of 18-24-year-olds watch at least one hour of reality TV weekly\u2014and created a TikTok reality show, Cr\u00e9me House , to drive engagement and growth. In the last quarter reported, Danone saw an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.8% across its North American market. Benjamin Braun Benjamin Braun CMO, Samsung Europe FOLLOW Because Braun markets with the conviction that scale isn\u2019t incompatible with agility and that \u201ceven if you work for a massive global conglomerate like Samsung you operate as a start-up team.\u201d With a remit including oversight of the company\u2019s marketing across 44 countries, Braun tells Forbes that you can\u2019t \u201callow yourself to become complacent and slow. You think big and figure out how to deliver without a budget or people. Change,\u201d he says, \u201cis driven by people with ideas. Not budgets.\u201d For Braun, marketing isn\u2019t just about storytelling\u2014it\u2019s about proving real business results because, and as he says, \u201conly then will we gain credibility.\u201d Illustrations of this and his entrepreneurial approach are seen in the brand\u2019s activation at the Paris Olympics. Rather than spending millions on advertising, Braun and his team went guerrilla\u2014gifting 17,000 Samsung foldable phones to Olympians and Paralympians, requesting only that they unpack them on social media. This led to \u201cVictory Selfies\u201d on Olympic podiums, massive global exposure at a fraction of the cost, and a 23% sales increase. International online research data and analytics firm YouGov recently named Samsung the #1 Best Global Brand for 2025. Heidi Browning Heidi Browning Senior EVP and Chief Marketing Officer, National Hockey League FOLLOW Because as sports\u2019 traditional broadcast model evolves to a multi-platform and direct-to-consumer one, Browning markets knowing engaging the next generation of fans requires a transformation in skills and approach. Equating the entrepreneurial mindset driving the league\u2019s marketing to the \u201ccowboy ethos\u201d she learned growing up in Montana, Browning tells Forbes , this cowboy spirit creates the \u201cfearless pursuit of new frontiers, question(ing) everything; both why and why not; and being comfortable with the unknown.\u201d To ensure the NHL\u2019s continued growth, Browning and her team apply the lessons of start-up culture to invite new fans and revenues into the sport and league. Examples include creating the Power Players Youth Advisory Board, embedding Gen Z perspectives directly into marketing decisions to ensure future generation relevance, launching an original content docuseries, \u201c Face-Off: Inside the NHL,\u201d with Amazon Studios among others, and which succeeded in driving both upper and lower funnel growth metrics. The NHL saw record-breaking business performance in 2023-24, with revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year increase, and total attendance hitting an all-time high of 22.9 million. Jason Bunge Jason Bunge CMO, Hasbro FOLLOW Because when Bunge joined the 102-year-old toy category icon as its first CMO in 2023, \u201cthere was,\u201d as he told Forbes , \u201cthe opportunity and need to build an entirely new marketing organization; construct a new set of marketing capabilities to snap to the company\u2019s evolving business portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, redefine the role of marketing for the different needs of each business.\u201d The former Riot Games CMO and his team approach driving growth recognizing the challenges and opportunities for the company\u2019s principal business lines (toys, physical games and digital/video games) \u201care bespoke, and the marketing organization must be able to demonstrate agility, efficiency and scale in how it addresses each.\u201d To these ends, Bunge carved out 5% of their budget \u201cfor a first-of-its-kind company test-and-learn agenda,\u201d in order \u201cto inject a new mindset of \u2018roles of brands\u2019, (because) not everything was going to grow and not everything needed the same type or amount of marketing.\u201d This approach drove insights allowing Bunge and his team to understand where resources would have the greatest impact and return. As Bunge shared, \u201chaving an entrepreneurial mindset sometimes means breaking old habits and fighting hard to create space and oxygen for new approaches.\u201d Emma Chalwin Emma Chalwin CMO, Workday FOLLOW Because as she leads all marketing globally for this enterprise software company, Chalwin is intent on driving growth by \u201cbreaking the B2B mold.\u201d As Chalwin and her team disrupt Workday\u2019s traditional marketing and ensure it is anything but category-typical, she never loses sight of the fact that, as she told Forbes , \u201cwe\u2019re not just selling to a business; we\u2019re selling to the people who work there.\u201d This human-centric approach to enterprise marketing is driven by a mindset rooted in what she describes as rule-breaking, risk-taking and acting like \u201can entrepreneur inside a Fortune 500 company.\u201d Believing that challenging the status quo of B2B marketing requires a sense of humor and resolve, she and her team launched the Rock Star 2.0 campaign, bringing an \u201cunexpected irreverence\u201d that challenged conceptions about who the rock stars of business are. Chalwin tells Forbes the campaign increased web traffic by over 50% and lead-to-sales conversions by 17%. She\u2019s also working to train 20,000 employees as brand ambassadors to ensure everyone can share a consistent and compelling brand story. Workday\u2019s FY25 revenues increased 16.4% YoY. Kim Chappell Kim Chappell Chief Brand Officer, Bobbie FOLLOW Because in order to compete against industry Goliaths, Chappell is helping build this infant formula company into more than just a business and is reshaping conversations and expectations about modern parenting. For Chappell, being an entrepreneurial marketer isn\u2019t just a mindset\u2014it\u2019s a muscle. As she told Forbes , \u201cyou have to train yourself to move in the moment without hesitation\u2014with limited resources and often without a blueprint for success. If you don\u2019t go do the work, it\u2019s just another idea, what-if, or magic moment lost.\u201d One example of Chappell\u2019s approach to advancing the conversations driving Bobbie\u2019s growth, is when a Times Square billboard featuring culinary influencer Molly Baz, pregnant, in underwear, and holding lactation cookies over her breasts was removed for violating the billboard owner\u2019s guidelines, Chappell and her team saw opportunity and moved to both seize and make the moment. In only two weeks, Bobbie had Baz back on a Times Square billboard, this time breastfeeding her newborn\u2014a cultural first\u2014and apt illustration of Chappell\u2019s entrepreneurial conviction that \u201cnot everything needs a quarter of planning to be on brand, bold and successful.\u201d Chappell tells Forbes that over the past year, Bobbie has become the fastest-growing brand in its category. Daniel Cherry III Daniel Cherry III SVP & General Manager, adidas FOLLOW Because for Cherry, entrepreneurial marketing is about \u201calways being in beta, and instead of fearing failure embracing it as critical feedback pushing ideas one step closer to thrilling the consumer.\u201d As Cherry helped lead the brand through the very public early-end of its controversial partnership with Kanye West his perspective on failure as feedback would make the difference. \u201cWe suffered a crisis of confidence and almost believed the hype,\u201d he told Forbes . But rather than replacing the void left by the end of that partnership with another, Cherry thought and did differently, turning to adidas\u2019 greatest asset\u2014its archive\u2014and creating \u201cOriginals LA.\u201d Intended as a new business unit not just a marketing approach, Cherry\u2019s idea for moving the business forward looked backwards. By tapping the brand\u2019s archives, Cherry and his team helped put adidas back at the center of sneaker culture, as evidenced by the near ubiquity of Sambas and Gazelles over the past year. Cherry also built forward, championing new collaborations blending nostalgia with modernity, launching initiatives like the adidas Foundation, and restructuring creative workflows to give designers greater autonomy. For the quarter ending December 2024, company revenues had increased nearly 24% YoY. Kristyn Cook Kristyn Cook EVP and Chief Agency, Sales & Marketing Officer, State Farm FOLLOW Because in the crowded and complex insurance market, Cook leads marketing for this category leader with a conviction that it\u2019s only by \u201ctaking the right calculated risks where you have opportunity to win big.\u201d Importantly though, the work Cook leads proves entrepreneurial marketing doesn\u2019t always mean chasing reinvention for reinvention\u2019s sake, Cook and her team are amplifying State Farm\u2019s most powerful assets\u2014its signature red, iconic jingle, and, of course, Jake from State Farm\u2014by positioning them in high-profile, real-world moments that matter. \u201cOur goal is to stay nimble so we can jump in on trending cultural moments,\u201d Cook told Forbes . As examples, the brand has been a first-mover in the category in Gaming, and when Donna Kelce became a cultural focal point, State Farm took advantage of the moment by placing Jake next to her at a game, amplifying brand I.P. and creating a clutter-breaking moment for the brand. A 25-year company veteran, Cook oversees both marketing and sales. And in support of the 18,000 agents in its network, she and her team \u201calways strive to be \u2018market movers\u2019 in any space in which we play.\u201d Phil Cook Phil Cook CMO, WNBA FOLLOW Because during an explosion in interest from fans and partners alike, Cook, the league\u2019s first CMO, is ensuring the WNBA isn\u2019t just riding a wave of growth but actively driving it. Cook and his team are creating a new marketing playbook for the WNBA and its rising stars, during a time of unprecedented attention on women\u2019s basketball. While most leagues pay little attention to their players\u2019 pasts once drafted,Cook and his team took a different strategic approach with their \u201cWelcome to the W\u201d campaign, as college stars including Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink segued from the NCAA to the WNBA. In leading efforts to bridge the players\u2019 college and pro journeys, the campaign leaned heavily into the players\u2019 college pasts, creating a narrative continuity helping grow the league\u2019s fan-base on the players\u2019 existing ones. This, as well as a differentiated commitment to social impact, a heightened focus on dimensionalizing player narratives, and creating a 24/7 content hub for the league amongst other efforts, are driving unprecedented numbers for the WNBA. Last year witnessed the largest rights deal in the league\u2019s history, an aggregated $2.2B across ESPN, Amazon and NBCUniversal; sponsorship revenue and demand exploded, as attendance increased 48% and sellout games 242% YoY. Stefano Curti Stefano Curti Chief Brands Officer, Coty FOLLOW Because with a determination to \u201cmake a large company small again,\u201d Curti is ensuring leaner teams and faster decision-making help transform Coty into a nimbler player across the global beauty category. As the leader of a transformation that\u2019s revitalized brand icons like CoverGirl and Rimmel, Curti\u2019s entrepreneurial approach is rooted in speed and connection. In order to mirror the approach of smaller and niche-beauty players, and nurture the brands\u2019 internal \u201ccool factor,\u201d he and his team created an internal incubator, Agile Beauty, which operates like a startup within Coty. Since its inception, the incubator has developed trend-driven products in just eight months, an industry-best for a global beauty powerhouse. To these same ends, Curti and his team have built new advocacy and community programs, engaging influencers and beauty creators not only to amplify storytelling but to co-develop products. With a remit spanning Europe, North America, and high-growth markets like India, Latin America, and the Middle East, Curti and his team are expanding Coty\u2019s global footprint while leveraging its dominance in prestige fragrance\u2014a category he calls \u201cthe skincare of the mind\u201d\u2014to drive future innovation and consumer engagement. Coty reported 10% net revenue growth in 2024, outpacing the 9% global beauty market increase. D-K Carmen DeRosas Carmen DeRosas EVP, Head of Marketing, Rakbank FOLLOW Because by challenging status quo and conventional industry norms, DeRosas is redefining what marketing is in the UAE\u2019s financial services category, and helping lead the transformation of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. Since arriving at Rakbank, DeRosas tells Forbes she has \u201cimplemented a culture of continuous experimentation\u2026that continues to challenge and improve our models,\u201d evidence of which can be seen in a near 60% reduction in agency costs and 50% increase in asset turnaround times during her tenure. Ensuring that marketing is a driver of the company\u2019s innovation and transformation, has DeRosas and her team embracing a challenger brand ethos and shifting mindsets \u201cfrom fear to exploration,\u201d which she credits with helping drive \u201cthe step change we have created across all marketing disciplines, from transforming the way we show up, reshaping agency partnerships, launching campaigns that have elevated brand perception and performance, to delivering a 4x uplift in digital acquisition.\u201d With industry expertise honed during time at PayPal and American Express, DeRosas\u2019s remit includes overseeing the Rakbank brand, its insurance technology platform Protego, and family finance app Skiply. Since getting to Rakbank, DeRosas and her team have driven a major shift in marketing\u2019s role at the bank\u2014and their enhanced brand focus has contributed to a 13-point increase in employee engagement, reinforcing her belief that a strong, people-first culture is key to sustained innovation and growth. Rakbank had record-breaking financial performance last year, and a 16.4% increase in net profits YoY. Carole Diarra Carole Diarra Global Vice President of Marketing, UGG FOLLOW Because the \u201cvision to see beyond traditional strategies and the agility to act on them in ways that drive real impact\u201d is helping Diarra fuel the iconic brand\u2019s transformation from its comfort-first origins to a broader fashion and lifestyle business. With a global remit, Diara and her team are redefining what UGG is, where it shows up, and how it connects with its audience. Under her marketing leadership, they\u2019re doing this by focusing on a combination of \u201cagile media thinking\u201d that is inverting status-quo channel approaches, a media-mix strategy shift to social-first, real-time creative decision making, and liberating their marketing from the category\u2019s traditional seasonal emphasis. An illustration of the latter and Diarra\u2019s enhanced emphasis on consumer-led innovation is the brand\u2019s \u201cUGG Season\u201d platform which, as Diarra shared with Forbes , \u201cdidn\u2019t start from us but from our community (including Cardi B)...we didn\u2019t create the movement; we recognized and amplified it, letting culture lead our strategy.\u201d This entrepreneurial approach, one untethered to the past, is also evident in UGG\u2019s unexpected collaborations with Paris Fashion Week, and fashion-forward brands including Sacai and Telfar. A core part of the Deckers\u2019 portfolio, for Q3FY25, the UGG brand reported +16.1% increase in net sales YoY. Cristina Diezhandino Cristina Diezhandino CMO, Diageo FOLLOW Because Diezhandino\u2019s marketing for Diageo\u2019s 200 brands is rooted in a \u201cmindset of possibility\u201d and an approach that she told Forbes , values \u201dprogress over perfection. It\u2019s okay to fail as long as we learn.\u201d Despite category headwinds created by a changing world and consumer attitudes and behaviors, Diezhandino realizes that what doesn\u2019t change is the need to stay \u201ccentered around celebrations, culture and memorable moments\u201d and that this in turn requires her marketing organization to \u201cunderstand\u2014and shape the future of\u2014socializing better than anyone else.\u201d To these ends, Diezhandino and her team have built a marketing organization thriving on \u201cconnected decisioning,\u201d curiosity, agility, experimentation, reorganizing marketing into \u201cagile brand communities\u201d which allows them to better turn insight into action. To accelerate the growth of $100+ (USD) brands, Diezhandino created the Diageo Luxury Group, uniting its luxury portfolio. To ensure her organization has the tools to act fast in evolving markets, Diezhandino spearheaded initiatives including a Virtual Studio \u201crevolutionizing how we create content\u201d, a global partnerships lab, and Diageo\u2019s largest consumer data initiative. With responsibility for marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the global portfolio, Diezhandino is thinking and doing differently to ensure Diageo\u2019s place in socializing\u2019s future. Brian Donnelly Brian Donnelly EVP, GM and Chief Commercial Officer, Ancestry FOLLOW Because Donnelly understands that \u201cspeed is a competitive advantage\u201d and, as he tells Forbes , while \u201cthere\u2019s a comfort in the \u2018tried and true,\u2019 challenging norms, experimenting fearlessly, and pivoting quickly, allows us to adapt and refine strategies in real-time.\u201d With P&L accountability for the 40-year-old genealogy brand\u2019s global business operations, Donnelly\u2019s remit includes oversight of marketing, growth, and business development across the 130 countries where they do business. Intent on \u201cinspiring a culture of innovation across the business\u201d Donnelly and his team identified a growth opportunity, creating a new market by leveraging their genetic testing expertise and applying it to the pet category for the first time. Focused on driving growth by marketing and raising awareness \u201cof the emotional, cultural and personal benefits that come from discovering your roots,\u201d Donnelly and his team are pushing boundaries and experimenting with the new as they reshape Ancestry\u2019s brand, commerce, and customer engagement. Donnelly reports that brand health metrics are rising and that, in 2024, the company saw double-digit growth in DNA kit sales. As of May 1, Donnelly will become the Chief Commercial Officer at Myriad Genetics. Bene\u0301 Eaton Ben\u00e9 Eaton CMO, Figs FOLLOW Because in leading marketing globally for this DTC healthcare brand, Eaton\u2019s entrepreneurial approach balances boldness and precision, and as she told Forbes , \u201cisn\u2019t just about disrupting\u2014but about building something meaningful and enduring.\u201d With a remit spanning 34 countries, Eaton and her team lean into the company\u2019s entrepreneurial DNA to fuel their own. For Eaton, entrepreneurial marketing \u201cisn\u2019t just about growth (but) about redefining how a brand can impact people, culture and the world.\u201d To these ends, and as one example, Eaton and her team led Figs to become Team USA\u2019s official Medical Team Outfitter, creating a global stage and moment celebrating the community in a never-been-done-before way. She says the effort drove \u201csignificant incremental revenue...but more than the numbers, this campaign redefined how healthcare professionals are perceived.\u201d The LA fires, which devastated the company\u2019s hometown, provide further illustration as Eaton and her team mobilized to quickly support over 1,500 displaced healthcare professionals. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a crisis response\u2014but testament to our entrepreneurial mindset: acting with urgency, empathy, and impact to show up for our community in moments that matter most.\u201d Colin Fleming Colin Fleming CMO, ServiceNow FOLLOW Because with a \u201cstubborn intolerance of mediocrity,\u201d Fleming focuses, as he tells Forbes on \u201cwhat could be, and refusing to be discouraged by the status quo.\u201d Insistent that \u201cnone of the Bs in \u2018B2B\u2019 should stand for boring,\u201d Fleming and his team are proving that bold storytelling, culture-shaping campaigns, and a strong point of view will drive growth regardless of sector. With a remit leading ServiceNow\u2019s end-to-end global marketing, planning and operations, Fleming has evolved company strategy from product-led to brand-led. As he and his team seek \u201cexponential thinking and big, bold ideas that break the mold,\u201d they\u2019ve rolled out the company\u2019s most comprehensive global campaign ever, high-profile and perception shifting partnerships, and \u201cProject Marie Kondo,\u201d which led to cutting 50% of their content creation to ensure focus on what \u201csparks joy\u201d for customers. \u201cThis simplification\u201d he told us, \u201cfrees our teams to concentrate on impact and alignment rather than volume.\u201d For the 12 months ending as of the date of this writing, Service Now\u2019s market capitalization was up 22%. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in ServiceNow.) Adrian Fung Adrian Fung Global CMO, eBay FOLLOW Because Fung brings a \u201cfounder\u2019s mentality\u201d to the iconic ecommerce brand, focusing, as he told Forbes , on \u201ctreating every dollar like it\u2019s your own, and finding scrappy ways to leverage existing assets, customers, partners.\u201d For Fung, a global remit for marketing a brand and multi-category business like eBay\u2019s, with some 130 million customers and over 2.1 billion listings, requires an approach he defines as \u201clearning fast rather than failing fast.\u201d And in order to leverage learnings to drive innovation at scale, Fung recognizes the need \u201cto balance speed and agility with the complexity and scale of eBay\u2019s (business). To do this, we identify small but high leverage opportunities that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to optimize impact.\u201d One example: An initially small-scale test with Facebook Marketplace in Germany which enabled buyers to browse eBay listings directly on Marketplace, rolled out internationally. Recognizing \u201cthis type of innovation can\u2019t be achieved from marketing alone - and requires an end-to-end approach\u201d finds Fung breaking down silos and challenging how problems are solved across the business. As of this writing, eBay\u2019s stock was up over 58% YoY. Arielle Gross Samuels Arielle Gross Samuels Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, General Catalyst FOLLOW Because with a global mandate across all marketing and communications, the former Blackstone CMO and 10-year Meta veteran, is looking to help redefine the company\u2019s place in its category and is \u201cbuilding from zero to one.\u201d In a category-atypical approach, Gross Samuels is using what she tells Forbes is \u201csurround-sound, cross-channel storytelling as a strategic commercial lever.\u201d To help lead the brand beyond its venture capital origins to that of a global investment and transformation company, Samuels and her team launched \u201c Venture Beyond \u201d, not just a campaign but an invitation to their ecosystem of founders, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. She credits the launch with \u201cinvigorating our ecosystem and expanding what\u2019s possible. \u201c For the year ahead, among other things, Gross Samuels and her team are focused on \u201cunveiling new strategic brand partnerships with major platforms, revitalizing our social strategy with franchised branded series, and convening first-of-their-kind forums to catalyze our community\u2014all in service to ecosystem transformation.\u201d By ensuring \u201cwe play our own game and operate as a category of one,\u201d Gross Samuels and her team are continuing to help redefine what people know of and expect from General Catalyst. Gail Horwood Gail Horwood Chief Marketing & Customer Experience Officer, Novartis FOLLOW Because Horwood doesn\u2019t see constraint in the pharmaceutical category\u2019s deeply regulated environment but a catalyst for integrating \u201cnow and next practices\u201d redefining how the company markets to drive impact. To better connect with their multiple constituencies, Horwood and her team have championed and facilitated the \u201ccreative and innovative;\u201d building Novartis\u2019 Innovation and Content Labs, and establishing its Media Center of Excellence, leading them to explore non-traditional category channels and audiences. They\u2019ve turned to gaming as a way to educate healthcare professionals and \u201cset new standards for audience engagement in the pharma industry.\u201d And while in many categories a Super Bowl ad is no proof of the entrepreneurial, in January, Horwood and her team broke company and category conventions with a campaign to raise awareness and drive screenings for breast cancer. The ad\u2019s creative was bold by any measure, especially within the context of pharma, and is a case study proving that any category\u2019s work can be emotionally resonant. As Horwood told Forbes , \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to just show up; we wanted people to receive the message and take action.\u201d A subsequent announcement of a broader partnership with the NFL \u201cmerges the power of sports, culture, and health advocacy in a way that has never been done before.\u201d As of their Q4 reporting, Novartis\u2019s stock was up over 15% YoY. Charisse Hughes Charisse Hughes Chief Growth Officer, Kellanova FOLLOW Because Hughes is proving that legacy CPG brands can lead cultural conversations\u2014and drive growth while doing it. Since joining Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), Hughes has transformed the company\u2019s marketing approach, leaning into bold, unconventional collaborations and innovations that extend beyond the company\u2019s broad portfolio of household names, including Kellogg\u2019s Pringles, and Cheez-Its, themselves. As Hughes told Forbes , \u201cin an era where traditional marketing strategies aren't enough, we have embraced unconventional, culturally resonant collaborations that push boundaries...(and) elevate our brands beyond transactional products to cultural icons.\u201d To these ends, one example of the work Hughes and her team have done is the collaboration between Crocs and Pringles, which went beyond a mere licensing deal in order to create mutually inspired products for both brands. This included the insta-worthy Pringles-inspired slides and the Crush Boot which sold out in under two hours, driving earned media in publications like GQ, not typically known for paying attention to pantry brands. In August, Mars, Inc. offered to acquire Kellanova for $36 billion. If it closes, this will be the largest CPG deal in over a decade. As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up over 51% YoY. Kerttu Inkeroinen Kerttu Inkeroinen Marketing and E-commerce Director, Lucky Saint FOLLOW Because Inkeroinen leads marketing for this six-year-old UK-based alcohol-free beer brand with a \u201cBreak Rules, Honor Traditions\u201d mantra, which she says, \u201callows us to challenge category norms while respecting beer culture.\u201d Despite having only a fraction of the marketing budget of her multinational competitors, Inkeroinen \u201capproaches every decision with big budget energy,\u201d telling Forbes she \u201csees opportunities where others see limitations and with the resilience\u2014what we call sisu in Finnish\u2014to push through.\u201d And while some may consider process and entrepreneurial agility to be opposed, Inkeroinen doesn\u2019t considering \u201ca well-structured framework what enables fast, efficient scaling.\u201d To these ends, she and her team introduced a cross-functional \u201cgate process\u201d to ensure rapid execution without quality compromises, and built a proprietary digital platform to, among other things, drive pint giveaways in pubs, an in-house innovation that she credits with \u201cremoving cost barriers and unlocking new distribution opportunities.\u201d Inkeroinen leads marketing, communications, innovation, and e-commerce for the brand across the U.K., and as it expands into Ireland and the Netherlands. Her entrepreneurial approach has helped Lucky Saint become what she says is the most loved and most Googled alcohol-free beer in the U.K. Marissa Jarrett Marissa Jarratt EVP, Chief Marketing & Sustainability Officer, 7-Eleven FOLLOW Because for Jarratt \u201cacting like an entrepreneur is a cornerstone of how I lead and inspire my team,\u201d an approach driving how she has built the marketing organization for this global retail giant. Focused on ensuring 7-Eleven doesn\u2019t just keep pace with cultural and consumer shifts but actively drives them while navigating market volatility and new resource constraints, Jarratt emphasizes agility, creativity, and resilience. With broad responsibilities in the U.S. and Canada across marketing, corporate communications, and sustainability, Jarratt and her teams navigated \u201cover 220 reputation-critical issues, implementing a three-tier crisis management strategy,\u201d introduced \u201cBig Bite Hot Dog-Flavored Sparkling Water\u201d on April Fool\u2019s Day to recruit Gen Z customers and publicize the launch of their private label sparkling water brand. The creatively dissonant effort drove a nearly 10% month-over-month increase in store brand sales and a 12% increase across the category; expanded 7-Eleven\u2019s in-house creative agency, producing campaigns faster and cheaper, all while also reducing plastic bag usage by 37%. Jarratt is intent on \u201csteering the brand out of a challenging 2024\u201d and will continue enhancing the retailer\u2019s \u201cability to adapt and innovate, even in a resource-constrained environment. Nicolas Kettelhake Nicolas Kettelhake CMO, Polaroid FOLLOW Because in a digital world saturated with \u201cperfect\u201d images, Kettelhake is reinvigorating an 80-year-old analog brand, making what\u2019s old new again by proving that imperfection sells. Kettelhake and his team market by counterprogramming and leaning away from\u2014rather than into\u2014digital cultural trends. Because Polaroid images can\u2019t be retouched, Kettelhake and his team have delivered what he described to Forbes as \u201ca counter to digitized, altered, \u2018perfect\u2019 photography, because Polaroid is one of one, and inherently imperfect due to the chemical development process.\u201d Kettelhake ensures the brand\u2019s claim to a positioning rooted in the tactile and imperfect not only drives communication but product innovation. To make a statement against the endlessly replicable nature of digital images, he and his team have elevated the craft of instant photography by appealing to high-end professional photographers, invited digitally-native consumers into the brand by becoming part of sub-cultures, and created a new membership program. By zigging while culture zags, Kettelhake\u2019s integrated, multi-channel and cohort approach has sold-out both new products and film, and driven YoY double digit sell-through increase across the full business. Kettelhake left Polaroid as of April 1st. L-N Drieke Leenknegt Drieke Leenknegt CMO, Vans FOLLOW Because Leenknegt understands that in the ever-changing consumer landscape, today\u2019s \u201cmarketing isn\u2019t about incremental change\u2014it\u2019s about transformation.\u201d Despite its globally iconic brand status, Leenknegt inherited a business facing years of declining revenue and a turnaround imperative. Her entrepreneurial approach to marketing has helped reverse Vans\u2019 decline and position it for long-term growth. Since joining two years ago, Leenknegt has restructured the company\u2019s global marketing team, going beyond necessary surface-level adjustments to deep, strategic reinvention that is connecting dots across marketing, product, and commerce. All of this is driving what she tells Forbes is \u201cagility, alignment, and profitability, ensuring innovation is more than just an idea.\u201d Leenknegt and her team are embracing and deploying an \u201calways on marketing model...that balances reinvention with authenticity.\u201d Illustration is found in their creation and launch of a new pinnacle segment, OTW by Vans , at Paris Fashion Week. Describing this as both a product and cultural innovation, Leenknegt credits the innovation with fueling extraordinary sell-through and, as being but one effort that is helping restore brand momentum. While numbers for the VF Corp-owned brand are off the record, Leenknegt reports a return to growth and that brand and business have turned around. Diego Lomanto Diego Lomanto CMO, Writer FOLLOW Because without the tens of billions of dollars raised by competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lomanto leads marketing for this startup generative AI enterprise solution, certain that \u201cwinning in AI isn\u2019t just about who builds the best model, but about who owns the conversation.\u201d Given their relative resource constraints, Lomanto and his team approach owning the conversation by ensuring Writer is, as he told Forbes , \u201cimpossible to ignore to the folks we wanted to have a conversation with...that wherever AI decision-makers looked, they saw Writer, setting us apart in a highly competitive, scrutinizing and often hesitant market.\u201d The brand\u2019s outsized presence on stage, in headlines, and on billboards along Silicon Valley\u2019s busiest highways was just one part of its scrappy reach and frequency strategy. Certain that \u201cthe entrepreneurial marketer knows the best marketing comes from customers who can\u2019t stop talking about their ROI,\u201d Lomanto created a program targeting analysts, a.k.a. the influencers of the AI category, marketing the brand as an ROI catalyst and movement, turning \u201cour biggest successes\u2014for companies like Salesforce and Uber\u2014into our biggest marketing assets.\u201d At the end of 2024, the company raised an additional $200 million, increasing its valuation to $1.9 billion. Victoria Lozano Victoria Lozano EVP and CMO, Crayola FOLLOW Because despite Crayola\u2019s dominant market share, Lozano pushes the business to think and market like a challenger, redefining not just what Crayola sells, but repositioning the brand and business by repositioning creativity itself. To Lozano and her team have redefined how the company creates commercial value. As Lozano told Forbes, \u201cCrayola is a bigger brand than business,\u201d and in order to capitalize on the former and overcome the latter, she and her team are shifting long-held but limiting parental perceptions about Crayola as just an arts-and-crafts brand by marketing \u201cbeyond the crayon,\u201d embedding the brand deeper into family routines and educational systems. To these ends, Lozano launched Campaign for Creativity , an advocacy movement reframing creativity\u2014and Crayola\u2019s role in it\u2014as a critical life skill; and built Crayola Studios, a content development and production division that creates programming across genres for kids and their parents. The studio already has some dozen partnerships, including those with parent company Hallmark, a BBC Kids partnership, and a brand partnership with audiobook platform Audible. Lozano\u2019s entrepreneurial approach is reframing the brand, its scope, and creating new sources of revenue. Martina Luger Martina Luger Chief Brand & Culture Officer, Ennismore FOLLOW Because as Luger leads marketing for this, U.K. based hospitality enterprise, she\u2019s rejecting the category\u2019s traditional price-based segmentation, and instead deploying a narrative-driven model to position and differentiate the company\u2019s brands. With a portfolio including The Mondrian, Hoxton and SLS brands, Luger and her team focus on disruptive lifestyle strategies rooted in her conviction that safe ground never leads to innovation. As she told Forbes , the entrepreneurial marketer has to have \u201cthe courage to stand on the edge of a cliff because only at the edge do you get the most amazing views.\u201d Luger and her team are \u201cmaking the statement that our hotels are more than just transactional decisions,\u201d an approach further illustrated by Ennismore\u2019s \u201cgame-changing\u201d loyalty program, \u201cDis-loyalty.\u201d Luger shared that while \u201ctraditional loyalty models reward people for sticking to the familiar\u2014we wanted to flip that idea on its head,\u201d and with no points, tiers, or blackout dates, members get 20% off first-time stays, and 10% off return visits, part of what\u2019s driving growth across her global remit for marketing 17 brands, and over 170 hotels in more than 35 countries with another 120+ in the pipeline. Astha Malik Astha Malik Chief Business and Marketing Officer, Braze FOLLOW Because certain \u201cthere has never been a better time to be a better marketer,\u201d Malik is unconstrained by the tried and true and untethered to industry standards and expectations. With a broad remit across this SaaS platform\u2019s corporate strategy, global expansion, and growth initiatives redefining how brands connect with their audiences\u2014and how Braze connects with its, Malik encourages innovation, as she told Forbes , by ensuring her teams are \u201ccomfortable with failure\u2014because it\u2019s not final.\u201d Malik and her team created the company\u2019s Innovation Lab, 427\u00b0, a consulting initiative providing clients agency like services during and post-sales in order to help them rethink customer connections at scale to provide clients, because Malik believes \u201cthe best marketing doesn\u2019t just drive pipeline, it builds enduring and valuable relationships. The Lab, but one illustration of her entrepreneurial approach in action, has \u201caccelerated sales cycles, improved satisfaction, and set us apart.\u201d Malik remains intent on challenging assumptions about the CMO role, ensuring marketing always has a seat at the Board table, and \u201cchallenging everyday actions and standing out when others may prefer to just fit in.\u201d For Q4 25, the company reported YoY revenue growth of 22%. Devika Mathrani Devika Mathrani Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, New York-Presbyterian FOLLOW Because in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape, Mathrani is \u201cshaping the future of health care and changing the conversation in the category\u201d for one of the nation\u2019s top 10 healthcare systems, by bringing unconventional strategies to a category not known for same. Mathrani and her team are challenged not just by their competitive set but also a glut of healthcare disinformation. When \u201calongside the rise of (public health) misinformation, we recognized the need to inform and empower consumers\u201d, as Mathrani told Forbes , they launched a newsroom operation to \u201cpublish trusted information\u2014helping people navigate their health proactively and reactively.\u201d When New York City faced a critical blood-supply shortage, Mathrani and her team drove essential donations by turning donations into a limited-edition product drop, applying a scarcity marketing model common in footwear but not in healthcare. Partnering with renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, donating blood became the only way to get Ansel\u2019s \u201c3 Lives Bar.\u201d Thinking and acting outside category norms led to a 25,000 percent (not a typo) increase in traffic to the donation site, and a 40% increase in donations. Stephanie McCarty Stephanie McCarty Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Taylor Morrison FOLLOW Because McCarty is challenging home-building category norms, transforming a traditionally rigid and slow-moving process in order to fundamentally reshape how buyers navigate one of the most significant purchases of their lives. With oversight of marketing for one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, McCarty told Forbes she is intent \u201cnot just on adapting to change but driving it, ensuring our marketing plays a critical role in our growth and shaping the future of the industry.\u201d McCarty and her team have led the company to create a fully-digital shopping experience, an \u201cunheard of\u201d first for the homebuilding category. As she told Forbes , this consumer-centric innovation drove meaningfully higher conversion rates, exponentially reduced cancellations, and increased revenue. McCarty, whose remit includes overseeing marketing and consumer engagement across 21 markets, has also redefined how homebuilders connect with consumers, turning social media from a branding tool into a direct revenue driver, another category first. Despite an environment marked by significantly higher interest rates, as of this writing, the company\u2019s stock was up over 7% YoY. Sarah Moore Sarah Moore CMO, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store FOLLOW Because as Moore leads marketing for the culturally iconic restaurant chain, she does so with the conviction that entrepreneurial marketing \u201cis not just the high-stakes journey of a disruptive startup\u2014but about leading transformation when the odds are against you\u2014when competition is fierce, behaviors are shifting, and a brand must evolve or fade.\u201d With oversight of all marketing for the chain\u2019s 660+ locations, including brand, culinary menu architecture, and pricing strategy, Moore and her team are driven by \u201cbucking category norms...and the relentless pursuit of discomfort.\u201d A s rising egg prices became their own source of discomfort for customers nationally, Moore told Forbes that she and her team flipped the competitive script and, \u201cinstead of raising prices (like competitors), we launched a rewards promotion where members earned extra for egg-based dishes.\u201d She credits the simple and counter-intuitive move with driving higher guest frequency and spend and adding 6 million new loyalty program members in just year one. Modernizing a brand that is literally rooted in the \u201cold\u201d is no small challenge. But Moore\u2019s take on being an entrepreneurial CMO \u201cisn\u2019t just about building something new. It\u2019s also about reinventing, reimaging, and revitalizing something that already exists.\u201d Michael Moses Michael Moses CMO, Universal Pictures Because in a landscape where \u201call the content in the world is the push of a button away,\u201d Moses markets acutely aware that \u201claunching every film is akin to launching a new business...every few weeks.\u201d Over the past year ,Moses, who has been with Universal for 25 years, seven as global CMO, oversaw marketing for a portfolio including Wicked and The Fall Guy, and as he told Forbes, always with a \u201chealthily skeptical eye on data because its proliferation is an alluring siren call that risks narrowcasting the audience and making all our approaches homogenized.\u201d For \u201cTwisters \u201d, overcoming this siren call meant tapping into an overlooked Heartland audience through country music partnerships and broadening the film\u2019s appeal without alienating traditional moviegoers. For \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d, Moses and his team took a slow-burn strategy\u2014festival screenings, a dialogue-free trailer\u2014helping make it 2024\u2019s top original animated title and making \u201c Wicked \u201d a ubiquitous cultural presence. In 2024, Universal led the domestic box office, surpassing $1.9 billion in ticket sales and securing four of the year\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films. P-Z Nicole Parlapiano Nicole Parlapiano CMO, Tubi FOLLOW Because in leading marketing globally for this FOX owned ad-supported streamer, Parlapiano is \u201cstripping fear from the equation and leaning into risk (to) drive business growth.\u201d As Parlapiano sees it, marketing today requires not just doing differently but thinking dangerously. With this in mind, as she told Forbes , she looks to identify \u201cmarketers who have dangerous ideas,\u201d and that while she has \u201cdone work that could fail, it\u2019s better to throw your hat in the ring than to wait for perfection.\u201d Along with a broad remit to grow Tubi\u2019s brand and audience, Parlapiano works closely with the streamer\u2019s B2B team in order to demonstrate how valuable Tubi\u2019s viewers are to advertisers. To these ends, her creatively dissonant \u201c Tubi Is More Popular Than\u201d campaign did just this, reframing both brand and business. Also, Parlapiano and her team launched Stubios , a \u201cfirst-to-market product\u201d for aspiring filmmakers and their fans, that gives the camera to \u201canyone who has a story and puts the power to greenlight in the hands of the viewer.\u201d The first class of Stubio projects goes live later this year. Over the past year, Tubi has seen monthly-average-user growth of 23% YoY. Lynn Pina Lynn Pina CMO, GeoBlue FOLLOW Because Pina drives marketing for this travel medical insurance brand with what she describes as an \u201cowner\u2019s mindset.\u201d As she told Forbes , \u201cwhen you see yourself as an employee only, you can be passive, complacent, and easily defeated. With an owner\u2019s mindset, I\u2019m relentless about finding solutions and creative approaches to achieve the desired outcome.\u201d For Pina, whose remit includes Marketing, Product and Customer Experience, driving growth with entrepreneurial marketing approach is about \u201cstriking the right balance between building and breaking,\u201d a perspective that has served Pina and the company well, in the highly regulated category, and over the past year in particular. In just six months\u2014rather than the usual 18-24\u2014Pina and her team led the creation and launch of a new product and partnership, Globaline , which significantly expanded the GeoBlue\u2019s portfolio and market reach. Doing so required Pina and her team to challenge assumptions, break down barriers, and build from scratch, all while working across two companies with two different cultures and competing priorities. Pina reports that the product launch reached 80% of its first-year goal within just six months. Surhabi Pokhyrial Surabhi Pokhriyal EVP, Chief Digital Growth Officer, Church & Dwight FOLLOW Because as digital has become 70% of the 186-year-old CPG company\u2019s media mix, Pokhriyal works to \u201cscale fast and scrap fast\u201d in a landscape where \u201cmany new shiny things come and fizzle often.\u201d For brands including household names like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and Waterpic, Pokhriyal tells Forbes that, over the past year, she and her teams have \u201cstarted using social as the \u2018third shelf\u2019 and have partnered with some 4000 influencers in order to create \u201ca virtuous cycle for social engagement drives online and in-store sales.\u201d This, along with ensuring \u201c\u2019no-dead-end media\u2019 and that over 90% of our media is shoppable, is how our teams truly scale fast and scrap fast when needed.\u201d Knowing that today\u2019s status quo can be disrupted in an instant, she and her team \u201ckeep raising the bar with readiness not just for the here and now, but for tomorrow.\u201d Pokhriyal credits this approach\u2014and a \u201chealthy sense of paranoia\u201d\u2014with helping \u201cdrive outsized eCommerce growth versus CPG peers.\u201d In the last year, Church & Dwight\u2019s revenue growth surpassed its outlook and, according to sources, outperformed its competitors. Amanda Rubin Amanda Rubin CMO, Citadel FOLLOW Because since joining the world\u2019s most profitable hedge-fund, Rubin is redefining what marketing means and does in a firm and industry that has long operated behind closed doors. As Rubin told Forbes , entrepreneurial marketing \u201crequires not only showing others what needs to be done, but more importantly, what else is possible even when it deviates from the status quo.\u201d Until Rubin, Citadel\u2019s marketing status quo relied largely on earned media-driven awareness of the firm\u2019s financial acumen, with little time given to its brand or that of its founder, Ken Griffin\u2019s. Facing \u201ca fierce war for talent and very public scrutiny\u201d, Rubin built Citadel\u2019s marketing function from the ground up to better position the company\u2014and Griffin\u2019s philanthropic efforts\u2014among what she describes as a \u201ccomplex ecosystem of audiences, from talent to commercial clients, regulators and policy-makers...none of their journeys are linear, and their perceptions have enduring impact on our commercial success.\u201d By actively building a marketing narrative, making visible what had historically been opaque, and deploying a multi-faceted content strategy across dozens of new touchpoints and channels, Rubin and her team have helped drive a 50% YoY increase in talent applications, while concurrently tripling awareness of Griffin\u2019s philanthropic initiatives. 1x1_John Schoolcraft John Schoolcraft Chief Creative Officer, Oatly FOLLOW Because Schoolcraft conceived and built a new-model approach to creating a category and driving growth for this oat-milk brand and company. Schoolcraft takes pains to make clear he is not a CMO and that Oatly doesn\u2019t have a marketing department \u201cat all\u201d but a creative one, something he made a stipulation for joining the company in 2012. As he told Forbes , he believes \u201cmarketing departments are filters, and it is always better to work with makers and problem solvers and not approvers.\u201d This perspective led Schoolcraft to build the \u201cOatly Department of Mind Control\u201d (ODMC), which he describes as a team of creative problem solvers,\u201d instead of a traditional marketing organization. \u201cThe ODMC doesn\u2019t solve isolated marketing or brand problems, we understand everything is tied together, so look to solve business problems...(sitting) in on meetings from innovation to finance gives the creative department ownership and understanding of the business, which turns all of us into entrepreneurs.\u201d While one might argue with his definitions, Schoolcraft\u2019s approach is working. Despite slowing growth in the plant-based food category globally, 12+ years in, Oatly continues seeing double-digit sales increases YoY. Alex Schultz Alex Schultz VP Analytics and CMO, Meta FOLLOW Because with an unusually broad remit for a CMO, including global oversight of all analytics and business, public affairs, brand and direct response consumer marketing across Meta and its brand portfolio, the analytically-driven Schultz marries the quantitative and qualitative helping disrupt and reinvent how the company drives business outcomes. While WhatsApp is dominant outside the U.S., in the U.S., it remains a challenger brand. Recognizing that the biggest brand-unlock for the messaging app would be product\u2014not marketing\u2014driven initially, Schultz and his team \u201cdeployed product changes to make sharing to WhatsApp easier\u201d before launching the brand\u2019s largest US campaign to date. This effort, \u201cdirect response ads using our platforms and others...(which) bent the curve on topline growth.\u201d Identifying an internal lag-time stifling growth of the company\u2019s burgeoning live-shopping ad business, where customers wanted to boost ad-spends but the internal ad-review period \u201cmeant the live video would be over by the time we approved the ads,\u201d Schultz and his team brought the idea and insight needed to help the product team reimagine the review process, and leading to what he tells Forbes is \u201cexplosive growth of live shopping with business messaging.\u201d At the end of 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 21.94% YoY. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in Meta.) Geoff Seeley Geoff Seeley CMO, PayPal FOLLOW Because as PayPal\u2019s business evolves, Seeley is helping drive \u201ca new approach to product-led marketing that spins our consumer and merchant flywheel even faster.\u201d Seeley\u2019s role as marketing leader is to help conceive and realize new product innovation, and take these products to market across their 450 million customers, 35 million merchants, 200 markets, B2B and B2C, and family of brands, including its eponymous one, Venmo and Honey, In his first year since joining as Global CMO, Seeley drove what he describes as \u201cone of the most significant strategic and executional transformations in our history.\u201d Focused on, as he told Forbes , \u201crevolutionizing global commerce again\u201d Seeley and his team are \u201cworking back from (our) customers to create the next innovations.\u201d Evidence of this and Seeley\u2019s intent to catalyze growth by changing how people think about and use the company\u2019s products is seen in the launch of PayPal\u2019s largest-ever program, \u201cEverywhere,\u201d and its partnership with, among others, Apple Wallet, and in how he and his team are capitalizing on Venmo\u2019s becoming a verb, and \u201csubvert(ing) that soundbite to introduce people to a much wider world of Venmo.\u201d As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up more than 18% YoY. Peter Semple Peter Semple CMO, Depop FOLLOW Because Semple \u201cthinks of our brand, our experience and our proposition as \u2018Always WIP\u2019...obsessing about the context in which we operate and reflecting on how we might react. Our conviction to act is the entrepreneurial mindset in action.\u201d With a remit for the Etsy-owned marketplace that includes oversight for brand marketing and communications, merchandising, media, seller growth, and an in-house creative studio, Semple tells Forbes he is \u201cconsistently iterating on the brand we present to the world, and the combination of channels and messages we leverage to bring that brand into peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d Focused on audience expansion, brand differentiation, and market share growth in the U.S. and Australia, Semple and his team are unafraid to broaden the brand\u2019s platform and appeal beyond their traditional core demographic. Illustrations of their entrepreneurial approach in action includes expanding Depop\u2019s advocacy programs across 100 U.S. college campuses, cultivating a new generation of engaged brand ambassadors and, also in the US, removing seller fees in order to further differentiate the brand and business, lowering barriers to entry, and leading to material YoY market share growth. In March, Semple was named interim CEO of the company. Jinal Shah Jinal Shah Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, Zip FOLLOW Because Shah is driving growth for the buy-now-pay-later platform, by \u201cchallenging assumptions, moving with urgency, and transforming constraints into advantages.\u201d Having led the company through multiple strategic evolutions since joining in 2021, Shah and her team are now stewarding Zip through what she describes as its hyper-growth phase with a certainty that \u201copportunity is created, not waited for.\u201d Focused on \u201crewriting how people experience financial empowerment,\u201d in the crowded and regulated industry, Shah and her organization are \u201cembedding payment flexibility into everyday passions\u201d including NASCAR, MLB, and concerts. To decrease the brand\u2019s reliance on search networks Shah and her team built Commerce Media, a proprietary and brand-direct model, turning a profitability experiment into a fully independent business unit. Shah has also reframed customer experience, typically an \u201cafterthought in fintech\u201d into a competitive differentiator and, as she told us, \u201cfrom an operations cost center to a brand accelerator.\u201d Recognizing that \u201centrepreneurship is about building teams that can scale the mission,\u201d in the past year, she and her teams helped Zip realize a 45% revenue increase YoY. Charlie Smith Charlie Smith Chief Marketing and Communication Officer, Loewe FOLLOW Because Smith is \u201cpushing the boundaries of luxury fashion communication and perhaps even brand communication in general\u201d for the LVMH-owned brand. In a category long reliant on exclusivity, polish, and reverence, Smith and his team are rewriting the rules\u2014and the brand\u2019s renown\u2014by taking LOEWE in an unexpected and different direction, one where irreverence, lo-fi aesthetics, and surprising collaborations challenge convention, and transcending category constructs. For Smith and his team, challenging the status quo is rooted in what he told Forbes is their \u201ccollective willingness to embrace failure enabling us to push boundaries.\u201d Over the past year, Smith\u2019s How to Pronounce LOEWE campaign \u201ctackled head-on that many don\u2019t know how to pronounce our name, something other brands might have shied away from.\u201d He and his team turned a might-have-been-traditional celebrity campaign with Daniel Craig into subversive storytelling, creating \u201ca fresh context and a lot of conversation.\u201d Similarly, LOEWE\u2019s Suna Fujita collaboration reimagined the Japanese ceramist duo\u2019s whimsical figures as an animated universe, pop-ups, and a children\u2019s book, blending artistry with commerce in an entirely new way. Despite a challenging period for many luxury labels, in October, reports indicated LOEWE\u2019s sales had increased 27.5% YoY. In March, long-time Creative Director Jonathan Anderson left the label, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez were appointed. John Solomon John Solomon CMO, Therabody FOLLOW Because as Solomon leads global marketing for this wellness pioneer, \u201cthe biggest breakthroughs haven\u2019t come from rigid planning; they\u2019ve emerged from a willingness to seize unplanned, unbudgeted opportunities driving real consumer connection.\u201d The private-equity backed company is expanding into new verticals, markets, and audiences, without a commensurate expansion in marketing resources, but for Solomon and his team, \u201cwith no roadmap and limited resources\u201d, as he told Forbes , \u201cproved that speed and ingenuity can outpace size and budget constraints.\u201d By leaning into other brands\u2019 reach to supplement their own, Solomon and his team forged relationships with Sephora, developing a co-brand product leading to a 50% increase in the vertical YoY; with United Airlines to drive trial in their lounges; and when faced with the challenge of excess inventory, partnered with Hollywood and sports powerhouse CAA, to \u201cturn a potential problem into an opportunity,\u201d executing Name, Image and Likeness deals with tier 1 college football programs, \u201cto ensure Therabody was in the hands of the next generation of elite athletes\u2014who eagerly shared their experience on social media.\u201d Despite their flat marketing budget, Solomon reports their core wellness category grew 40% YoY. Marc Speichert Marc Speichert Chief Commercial Officer, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts FOLLOW Because Speichert, the first to have this title and combination of B2B and B2C responsibilities in the iconic brand\u2019s corporate history, is reimagining where the brand plays and how commercial returns are driven. Recognizing that organizational structure either facilitates or limits growth, over the past year, Speichert has integrated teams once operating separately, telling Forbes he has optimized \u201cend-to-end strategy and execution,\u201d reimagining corporate structure with \u201cmirror organizations...embedding subject matter experts within regions, allowing them to drive local agendas with autonomy, agility, and greater self-sufficiency.\u201d Long synonymous with hotel luxury, for Speichert and his team, driving growth and innovating at scale, has led them to take the brand into new businesses and categories. This includes launching the first branded Yacht voyage in January, which he describes as \u201ccreating something entirely new that challenges industry norms.\u201d At the same time, the brand\u2019s ongoing relationship with HBO\u2019s The White Lotus , was credited by Wallpaper as \u201cachieving something few luxury brands manage: catapulting into mainstream awareness while maintaining exclusivity.\u201d Speichert tells Forbes that these efforts and others are not only identifying and commercializing untapped \u201cwhite space\u201d but also leading the privately-owned company to record-breaking performance. Kate Trumbull Kate Trumbull EVP, Global CMO, Domino\u2019s FOLLOW Because, over the past year, in a category challenged by macro-economics and constrained consumer spending, Trumbull markets the iconic QSR brand determined to \u201cget speeding tickets, not parking tickets,\u201d as she told Forbes . Trumbull leads marketing for the brand and its 20,000 franchisees with an action-first approach believing \u201cpeople will like you for what you say, but they\u2019ll love you for what you do.\u201d For Trumbull and her team, brand actions are redefining \u201cvalue-driven initiatives beyond price (to) break through the sea of the same offers\u201d that have historically driven the category by \u201cturning consumer value into talk value.\u201d Efforts have included countering shrinkflation with MOREflation , reimagining a traditional buy-one-get-one offer as a brand equity moment with their Emergency Pizza 2.0 campaign, and turning a basic $3 coupon on its head with their You Tip, We Tip driver-appreciation effort. With oversight of Domino\u2019s marketing, product innovation, strategic partnerships and national sales, in over 90 global markets, and despite economic headwinds, Domino\u2019s has posted three consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales and order growth. As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up over 6% YoY. Sumit Virmani Sumit Virmani CMO, Infosys FOLLOW Because as he leads global marketing for the India-based IT services company, Virmani \u201cvalues the entrepreneurial attitude over mere skills, celebrating risk-taking, experimentation and recognizing excellence through failures that teach, not just successes.\u201d Despite competing against global companies that are better resourced and funded, it\u2019s this approach to marketing that is driving how Virmani and his team create differentiated and deeper connections to the brand as a short-term and long-term growth lever. Evidence of the approach in action includes Infosys\u2019s move into sonic branding, a strategy more typical for B2C marketers than B2B, where brand identity is typically limited to the visual. Certain that \u201cB2B clients (also) value an emotive connection and there\u2019s no reason for B2B to appeal only to the visual sense,\u201d Virmani and his team launched of The Sound of Opportunity\u2014a sonic signature, which was played more than 5 million times in its first six months. As AI continues shaping and reshaping the marketing landscape, Virmani is determined to ensure Infosys helps lead the way for its clients and prospective ones by investing \u201cdeeply\u201d in its brand. Over the past five years, and according to Brand Finance, Infosys\u2019s brand value has increased by 15% YoY, and the fastest-growing IT Services brand over the last 5 years. Marc Weinstock Marc Weinstock President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, Paramount Pictures Because Weinstock markets the studio\u2019s slate of films understanding that in today\u2019s rapidly changing content landscape a \u201cthink-different mindset is crucial. If you can\u2019t think outside the box and blaze a new trail, you\u2019ll simply fall flat.\u201d Over the past year, and for films and sequels including \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d, \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One \u201d, and \u201cGladiator 2 \u201d, Weinstock and his team were responsible not just for \u201ccreating or recreating a brand from the ground up nearly every four weeks\u201d as he told Forbes but, more relevantly, for leading the studio to five #1 domestic openings and three franchise-best sequel performances, despite sequels typically underperforming the originals. For Weinstock, success requires not just overcoming competition\u2014but inertia and staying home\u2014and makes marketing innovation mission critical, leading Weinstock and his team to work \u201cwith key platforms in ways no one\u2019s ever done.\u201d Examples include partnering with Snapchat to \u201creach every one of their users at once,\u201d and a \u201cMission Impossible \u201d interstitial starring Tom Cruise in this year\u2019s Super Bowl. In the midst of the parent company\u2019s reorganizations and sale process, in 2024, Paramount\u2019s filmed entertainment division revenues increased 67% YoY. Kate Wik Kate Wik CMO, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority FOLLOW Because when a brand is as defined in the public consciousness as Las Vegas, expanding perceptions required Wik to reinvent the traditional destination marketing playbook. With a remit to market and sell Vegas globally and, as Wik told Forbes, \u201cin an increasingly noisy world, with an abundance of competition in every category\u201d breaking through requires thinking entrepreneurially. To these ends, Wik and her team expanded on the city\u2019s entertainment roots by focusing on two marquee events, Super Bowl LXII and Formula 1. But, shifting perceptions for one of the most \u201cbranded\u201d cities in the world, required going beyond \u201csponsorship\u201d and doing things differently. Wik \u201cchallenged my teams and my partnerships with the NFL and Formula 1 to leverage their spotlights as a year-round marketing platform.\u201d By thinking beyond the traditional window, she and her team helped reset the rules of destination marketing. \u201cMy product is Las Vegas,\u201d Wik told Forbes , and the results of her repositioning it as \u201c The Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World\u201d are measured in broadened perceptions of a brand historically linked to \u201c What Happens Here Stays Here ,\u201d and in billions of dollars in direct revenues. Edoardo Zegna Edoardo Zegna Chief Marketing , Digital, and Sustainability Officer, Zegna FOLLOW Because in a marketing landscape evolving at warp speed, this fourth-generation leader of the Italian brand\u2019s founding family says, \u201cmy goal is to make Zegna the slowest company in the world.\u201d Zegna\u2019s approach to driving the business is instead rooted in his belief that, as he told Forbes , \u201cto build a product that lasts forever, you have to be slow; patience and time are indispensable ingredients to create a timeless brand.\u201d This perspective finds the brand\u2019s marketing not disrupting category convention so much as ignoring it. Describing his role at the 115-year-old company, not by his multi-hyphenate remit but as \u201cthe custodian of Zegna feelings\u201d, he and his team see their work as he told another publication about creating \u201cunscalable ideas and then figuring out a way to scale them.\u201d All but singularly focused on giving space\u2014often literal\u2014to stories and the emotions they engender, Zegna and his team launched, among other platforms, Villa Zegna , a private-club pop-up bringing the brand\u2019s heritage to life in key markets globally; turned a children\u2019s book about the company\u2019s origins into a week-long immersive experience in Milan, the first Zenga event with no clothes in it; and are creating Oasi Zegna (a Zegna Oasis) destinations around the world, as places to be slow and as metaphor for ZEGNA\u2019s commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and lasting impact.

(Image credit: Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) April's full moon lit up skies around the world this weekend, delighting skywatchers with a dramatic show. Known as the Pink Moon , or the Paschal Moon, this month\u2019s full moon was the smallest full moon of 2025. This is because it reached peak illumination at apogee, the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, earning its title of a \"micromoon\". Though the difference in size can be hard to spot with the naked eye, the moon\u2019s striking glow created a stunning backdrop for photographers and moon lovers alike. Despite its name, the Pink Moon isn\u2019t actually pink \u2014 it\u2019s named after the moss pink, one of spring\u2019s first wildflowers to bloom. As seen in the photos below, April\u2019s full Pink Moon did not disappoint. Photographer Robbie Pesiwarissa (Robbiesydney Photography) captured the beauty of the Pink Moon from a park in Sydney, Australia.

According to the Weibo-based account Digital Chat Station , the inner display, which is approximately 7.76 inches, will use a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution and feature \"under-screen camera technology.\" Meanwhile, the 5.49-inch outer display will use 2,088 x 1,422 resolution, and this screen will allegedly have a punch-hole camera. Digital Chat Station previously claimed that the inner folding display will have a 4:3 aspect ratio , and they also earlier revealed the alleged display dimensions of the iPhone Fold. Reputable Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since corroborated these dimensions, additionally describing the inner screen as \" crease-free .\" However, talk of the device using under-screen camera technology has not been claimed up until now. That said, rumors have suggested Apple is also working on a foldable iPad, and Digital Chat Station has previously claimed that this device will use under-display Face ID technology , so it could be that Apple is seeking design parity between the two foldable devices. Additionally, Kuo believes the rear-facing camera on the foldable iPhone will use dual lenses and that the device will forgo Face ID authentication, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. Apple will launch its long-rumored foldable iPhone next year with a ~$2,000 premium price tag attached, expects well-connected Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman . According to analyst Jeff Pu, the device recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn, with mass production slated to begin in the second half of 2026 . Foldable iPhone: All the Rumored Features So Far According to Gurman, the device will take advantage of the display, battery, modem, and chip advances that Apple has made in its development of the iPhone 17 Air , which is expected to replace the \"Plus\" model in Apple's smartphone lineup this year.

MacObserver spotted a Reddit post by user daevvan, which shows a screenshot of a notification that reads: \u201cThe iPhone 16 \u2013 From \u20ac39.54/month at 0% APR\u2026).\u201d iPhone 16 promoted via Apple Store without user opt-in The notification came through the standard iOS notification center, using the Apple Store app\u2019s alert channel, which normally only delivers order updates and receipts. Instead of a purchase update, users were surprised to see it used for a direct product promotion. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this happen before and I\u2019m at least moderately annoyed by it,\u201d wrote the original poster. \u201cI do like to keep the notifications on for when I buy something via the app.\u201d Others chimed in with mixed reactions. Some offered advice on how to disable Apple Store notifications, while others argued that Apple pushing product promotions via system alerts crosses a line, especially for a company that often criticizes ad-driven ecosystems. One commenter pointed out the core issue: \u201cTurning off notifications isn\u2019t the point. OP is raising the topic that the App Store sending adverts for Apple products via system-level alerts is weird.\u201d Others speculated Apple may be reacting to slow sales, while some noted they\u2019ve received similar alerts for Apple TV+ promos. Can you turn off Apple Store ads on iOS? Yes. According to our tests, you can. To do this, go to the Apple Store app \u2192 tap your profile icon \u2192 Settings \u2192 Notifications \u2192 toggle off \u201c Announcements and Offers \u201d. Or, go to iPhone Settings \u2192 Notifications \u2192 Apple Store, and disable alerts completely. Still, this raises a bigger question\u2014is Apple blurring the line between helpful alerts and unsolicited marketing? So far, the company hasn\u2019t responded to concerns about promotional alerts in its own app. But if more users report similar behavior, expect this to become a bigger discussion around user trust and notification transparency. One thought on \u201c Apple Allegedly Showing iPhone 16 Ads Through Apple Store Notifications \u201d I don\u2019t have any of these settings on my iPhone 16 iOS 18.4.

If you've ever bought a lip color just to realize it doesn't complement your skin as expected it would post-purchase, you're not alone. This is a universal experience for lipstick wearers everywhere\u2014and it's frustrating, to say the least. Lipstick shopping sounds like a walk in the park until you realize that navigating the vast world of a million different shades of pinks, peaches, berries, reds, wines, and browns isn't easy\u2014like at all. To narrow down the search a bit, you can call on the undertone matching method\u2014something plenty of makeup experts and wearers do on the regular. But just remember, makeup should be fun! When you overthink the shades and second-guess all your choices, all of a sudden it becomes belabored. Life can be stressful enough, let's not add \"lipstick undertones\" to the list of things that may give you pause. So even though the following are great pointers to help you on your shopping journey, the best advice is to just go with what makes you feel the best in your skin. Undertones 101 Skin tone has to do with the richness of your skin color (fair, medium, and deep for example). Undertones are the colors shining through under your skin. Each skin tone can have different undertones\u2014the main four being cool, warm, neutral, and olive. When lip color doesn't match the undertone, there may be a clash. \"It does matter, because when people wear pink lipstick, the pink lipstick can look completely different for each individual person,\" celebrity makeup artist & SHEGLAM Partner Allan Avendano tells mbg. \"Some pinks can turn orange, some can turn bubblegum pink\u2026It all depends on your undertone.\" However, like everything in beauty, the end-all-be-all is personal preference, as makeup is an art and not a science. If you like a shade of lipstick and it makes you feel good, that's all that matters, undertones or not. So, while identifying your undertones can be helpful, don't stress about it too much. Ultimately, makeup should be fun\u2014not a chore. Identifying your own undertones There are a few ways to figure out what undertones you may have. Here, a rundown: Paper test. \"Take a piece of red paper and a piece of blue paper, and put each next to your face to see what looks more flattering,\" natural makeup artist Amber Talarico once told mbg. \"If you look best with blue, you have cool undertones, and if you look best with red, you have warm.\" And for those people who look radiant with both? You likely fall somewhere in the middle and have neutral. Jewelry test. Look at what you prefer wearing or what you think looks best on you. Golds flatter warm tones, while silver flatters cool. (Of course, if you prefer either metal over the other, just wear what you want\u2014again, this is an art, not a science.) Vein test. This is simple: Look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear more blue or purple, you have cool tones. If they look more green, you're warm. And if they look like a mix of both, you have neutral. A quiz! Lucky you: We developed an easy quiz to help you figure out your own undertones. If you need to pop on over to take the quick assessment, please do. We'll meet you back here, ready to help you find a lipstick. Identifying undertones in lipsticks You may have figured out what undertones your skin has, but what about the lipsticks themselves? Yes, makeup has it's own undertones too. For example a red may have more blue undertones (making it a cool shade) or more coral (making it warm.) One way to figure out if the lip color is more warm or cool is to default to the paper test above: Compare the shade to red paper versus blue paper, and see which one it better blends with. However, a word of warning: Identifying undertones in reds and pink lipsticks can be a bit easier than doing so in nudes. \"When it comes to finding the right nude lipstick that matches your skin tone the key is to realize that nudes have undertones too. Some nudes have a pink undertone or an orange undertone,\" celebrity and editorial makeup artist Delina Medhin tells mbg. Pro tip: \"One tip that may be helpful is to look at your foundation color and mix a red or pink lipstick into it so you can see what the color would look like & keep adding to it, get the color to where you want it. Then use this mixture as a benchmark for matching a potential nude lipstick too,\" Medhin says. Cool undertones Cool undertones give the skin a pink, blue, or red hue. If silvery jewelry complements your skin best, you just might have cool undertones. This can show up more significantly under the eyes for some (yep, even if you have warm undertones otherwise). As the rule goes, you'll want to pull from those colors to find your perfect lipstick shade. Here are a few base colors you might be drawn to: For brown or neutral shades: Purple, mauve, taupe For reds: Cherry, wine, berry, purple For pinks: dusty or nude rose Warm undertones Warm undertones have a base of yellowish, gold, and peach hues sneaking through. If gold jewelry complements your skin better than silver, you may have warm undertones. You'll want to pull from generally warmer colors for your lip. A few hints to keep an eye out for: For brown and neutral shades: Caramel For reds: Brick, terracotta, candy apple For pinks: Peach, coral, orange Neutral & olive Neutral undertones have the luck of the draw, as most colors will complement a neutral undertone. This means you'll have both yellow and blue undertones, so you can pick from a wide variety of colors without worrying about clashes. Olive undertone is different from neutral (though they're often confused for the same). Olive undertones have a green, gray, and sometimes ashy undertone. When it comes to lip color, warmer and deeper colors tend to complement olive skin best, a few examples include: For brown and neutral shades: Chestnut, hints of gold, chocolate brown Reds: Deep corals, cranberry Pinks: Light to deep shades of peach The takeaway If you've been hunting for the perfect lipstick for your skin but haven't had any luck, hopefully, this guide will serve as a road map. At the end of the day, whatever lip color makes you feel beautiful and confident is the one you should choose, regardless of the undertones.

(Photo: Unsplash) The iOS 19 version is being widely awaited thanks to the news about some big changes expected from Apple this year. But that\u2019s not the only major change the company could have in store, with the iPadOS 19 update also being tipped to receive much-needed upgrades that could make it work like macOS on Macs. The report from Bloomberg this week suggests Apple is making wholesale changes across its platforms, and the iPadOS 19 version will not be left out from the action. The WWDC 2025 is slated for June 2025 , where we will see all these new Apple OS versions unveiled. related stories iPadOS 19 Update \u2013 Finally Like MacOS? Mark Gurman from Bloomberg claims Apple will offer three big upgrades with the iPadOS 19 version to make it operate like a Mac. He specifically points out that the new iPadOS version could get better with \u201cproductivity, multitasking and app window management.\" He does not reveal further details about the new version for iPad users but these three elements on the platform will definitely give it a big performance boost at the OS level. After all, the company has upgraded most of its new iPad Air and Pro models with the M3 or M4-series chips, which are well-equipped to deliver Mac-level performance on these slates. If Apple does manage to tweak and upgrade iPadOS 19 with these features and enhancements, we could finally get close to the dream of making the iPads an alternative to the Macs or a laptop. iOS 19 And Other Big Updates Coming To WWDC 2025 Apple WWDC 2025 will be taking place from June 9 to June 13, 2025.

The US Customs and Border Protection issued an updated guidance on the reciprocal tariff exclusions for specified products late Friday. Smartphones, laptop computers, monitors, hard drives, memory chips and chipsets will be exempt from the latest round of tariffs, which reached 145% for imports coming from China. While this is good news for major players like Apple and Nvidia, the exemption may be short-lived. President Trump announced on Sunday that he would be placing new tariffs on semiconductors in the coming weeks, which will include semiconductor chips and smartphones. The new tariffs will be announced in a \u201cweek or two\u201d and will be referred to as \u201ca special focus type of tariff\u201d. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the goal of these levies is to bring back smartphone and semiconductor production back to the US - a task that would take a number of years and imply a tremendous price increase for devices with consumers bearing most of the costs. Trump did leave a potential back door for tech giants like Apple, stating that there will be \u201cflexibility with some companies in the sector\u201d.

(Reuters) Indonesia will seek to strike trade, investment and financial-sector deals in week-long talks in Washington aimed at forestalling or mitigating planned tariffs from one of its biggest trading partners. A team of ministers intends to propose Indonesian investment in information technology and the oil and gas sectors in the US, and closing the country\u2019s multibillion-dollar trade gap with the world\u2019s largest economy by buying more American goods, among other measures, officials said Monday in Jakarta. \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs and non-tariffs that will be part of our negotiations,\u201d said Airlangga Hartarto, the coordinating economic minister leading the delegation. He said the team from Indonesia, which he described as \u201camong the first nations\u201d to hold talks in Washington, plans to meet April 16-23 with the US trade representative, the Treasury secretary, the commerce secretary and the secretary of state to negotiate tariffs. Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy is among the nations hardest hit globally by tariffs planned by US President Donald Trump, facing the prospect of a 32% levy on goods ranging from palm oil to apparel and footwear. The resource-rich nation last year had a surplus of around $18 billion in trade with the US. Hartarto was speaking after officials convened for several hours Monday to discuss and strategies to reach better terms with the US even beyond trade. The government has prepared a list of commodities it could import in greater quantities from the US and investment offers for US companies. He added that some Indonesian companies are also seeking to offer investment in the US as part of the negotiations. Hartarto said one topic up for discussion included rules that require companies in Indonesia to locally source some content of their goods sold domestically, long a sticking point with foreign investors such as Apple Inc. President Prabowo Subianto last week said the rules needed to be eased to make Indonesia more competitive. The meeting included representatives from the ministries of energy, finance and state-owned enterprises, as well as investment officials and the country\u2019s Financial Services Regulator. Others involved in the trip to the US include Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Foreign Minister Sugiono, Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Djiwandono and Mari Pangestu, a former trade minister and current member of Indonesia\u2019s National Economic Council advisory body.

Article content Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy is among the nations hardest hit globally by tariffs planned by US President Donald Trump, facing the prospect of a 32% levy on goods ranging from palm oil to apparel and footwear. The resource-rich nation last year had a surplus of around $18 billion in trade with the US. Article content Hartarto was speaking after officials convened for several hours Monday to discuss and strategies to reach better terms with the U.S. even beyond trade. The government has prepared a list of commodities it could import in greater quantities from the US and investment offers for US companies.

Article content Article content Hartarto said one topic up for discussion included rules that require companies in Indonesia to locally source some content of their goods sold domestically, long a sticking point with foreign investors such as Apple Inc.

With a sleek clamshell design and innovative features, this device could reshape the way you think about portable smartphone technology. If you\u2019re looking for a compact yet powerful device, the iPhone Flip might be the perfect upgrade. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details on why it\u2019s capturing so much attention. Watch this video on YouTube . Liquid Hinge Technology: A Leap in Foldable Displays A standout feature of the iPhone Flip is its liquid hinge technology , a significant advancement in foldable displays. Unlike many current foldable phones that struggle with visible creases on their screens, Apple\u2019s liquid hinge is designed to eliminate this issue entirely. This innovation not only enhances the display\u2019s visual appeal but also improves the tactile experience, offering a smoother and more premium feel every time you interact with the device. Apple\u2019s deliberate approach to perfecting this technology highlights its commitment to quality. While competitors like Samsung and Motorola have been refining their foldable designs for years, Apple has taken its time to deliver a more durable and polished product. For you, this means a foldable phone that\u2019s built to last and ready to provide a seamless experience from the moment it\u2019s in your hands. Compact Design with Advanced Battery Technology The iPhone Flip is expected to set a new standard for compactness and portability. With a slim profile of just 5.5mm when unfolded , the device will be thinner and lighter than many of its competitors. This is made possible by Apple\u2019s use of innovative carbon battery technology , which allows for a sleek design without compromising on battery life. As a result, you can enjoy a device that is both stylish and functional. When folded, the iPhone Flip\u2019s compact size makes it incredibly easy to carry, whether in your pocket or bag. Despite its portability, the device is expected to deliver battery performance comparable to current iPhone models. This ensures you won\u2019t have to sacrifice functionality or endurance for the sake of convenience, making it an ideal choice for users who are always on the go. Enhanced Displays for Seamless Usability The iPhone Flip will feature a foldable main display that matches the size and functionality of standard iPhones when unfolded. This ensures a familiar experience for users already accustomed to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Additionally, the device will include a rear mini-display , designed for quick tasks such as checking notifications, controlling music, or viewing widgets. This secondary screen enhances usability, especially when the phone is folded, allowing you to perform essential tasks without needing to open the device fully. Apple\u2019s renowned iOS optimization is expected to play a crucial role in making sure the foldable design integrates seamlessly with apps and features. For you, this means minimal adjustments to your daily workflow and a user experience that feels intuitive and natural. The combination of hardware innovation and software refinement ensures that the iPhone Flip will deliver the high-quality performance you\u2019ve come to expect from Apple. Who Will Benefit Most from the iPhone Flip? The iPhone Flip is designed for users who value portability and innovative innovation . If you\u2019ve been a fan of smaller iPhones, such as the Mini series, but want access to the latest technology, this device could be the ideal choice. Its clamshell design and compact form factor make it perfect for those who prioritize convenience without compromising on performance. As a non-Pro model, the iPhone Flip is expected to feature two cameras : a wide lens and an ultra-wide lens. This aligns with Apple\u2019s strategy of offering high-quality photography capabilities in its standard models while reserving advanced features, such as telephoto lenses, for Pro versions. Whether you\u2019re capturing stunning landscapes or everyday moments, the iPhone Flip is likely to deliver impressive results. Release Date and Pricing The iPhone Flip is anticipated to debut in 2026, potentially alongside the iPhone 18 series. Early reports suggest a starting price of around $899 , though this could vary depending on tariffs and market conditions. While it may not be the most affordable foldable phone on the market, its premium features and Apple\u2019s reputation for quality are expected to make it a compelling option for many users. For those seeking a device that combines portability, innovation, and seamless integration with the iOS ecosystem, the iPhone Flip promises to be a strong contender. Its anticipated release marks Apple\u2019s bold entry into the foldable phone market, offering a glimpse into the future of smartphone technology.

Zachary McAuliffe Staff writer Zach began writing for CNET in November, 2021 after writing for a broadcast news station in his hometown, Cincinnati, for five years. You can usually find him reading and drinking coffee or watching a TV series with his wife and their dog.

Since then, the game has grown into one of the biggest word games in recent memory. Wardle initially created the game for his partner before releasing it to the public, and then The New York Times bought it in 2022 . CNET's Gael Cooper has loads of tips and tricks to tackle each Wordle puzzle, but if you've completed today's game -- or just love puzzle games -- these alternatives are well worth your time. Wordle asks players to figure out a five-letter word in six or fewer guesses (we have a two-step strategy to help you solve the puzzle every time ). After each guess, the game shows gray blocks for the wrong letters, yellow blocks for the right letters in the wrong spot and green blocks for the right letters in the correct spot. It's addictive, but after you solve the daily puzzle or use up all your guesses, you have to wait until the next day to play again. You've likely already learned some tips, tricks and lessons from the popular word game , so why not apply your newly honed problem-solving skills to other puzzles, too? After all, Wordle isn't the only game in town. Here are 10 other puzzle games like Wordle you'll likely enjoy. Connections I know it's old, but I'm not even going to try to figure this out. New York Times/CNET Another New York Times-owned puzzle, Connections is a tricky word game. \"Players must select four groups of four words without making more than four mistakes,\" the New York Times wrote on X , formerly Twitter. There are also four color-coded difficulty levels for each game; yellow is the easiest, then green, the blue and finally purple. The game is also similar to the BBC quiz show Only Connect, and the show's host took to X to point out the connection. See what I did there? You can play Connections on any web browser, but you need a New York Times subscription ( which starts at $1 a week ) to play. Strands James Martin/CNET Strands is another New York Times-owned puzzle, but this game resembles a word search more so than Wordle and Connections. This game presents a theme every day to help you find words in a grid. In Strands words can appear forwards, backward, top-to-bottom or any number of ways in a traditional word search, and words can also form in the shape of an \"L\" or have a zigzag in them. When you find a word, tap the first letter and drag your finger to the other letters. Every letter in the puzzle is used, so if you still have letters that aren't connected to words, you aren't finished yet. You can play Strands on any web browser, but you need a New York Times subscription ( again, $1 a week ) to play. Quartiles Apple/CNET Quartiles is a new word game Apple News Plus subscribers can access on their iPhone or iPad that's running iOS 17.5 or later. In this word game, you're given 20 tiles with letters on them, and you're trying to put them together to form different words. The longest words are four-tiles long, and these are called Quartiles. The game can be tough, but finding just one of the Quartiles is as satisfying as remembering something that was just on the tip of your tongue. You can play Quartiles on an iPhone or iPad, but you need an Apple News subscription ( which starts at $13 a month ) to play. Multiple Wordle spinoffs: Dordle, Quordle, Octordle and Sedecordle Quordle has you solve four word puzzles at once which sounds daunting. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Getty Images Are you up for a challenge? If you love Wordle and want puzzle games that take more brain power, you'll want to check out either Dordle , Quordle , Octordle or Sedecordle . Each of these word games resembles Wordle, but they add more rows, columns and words to solve. Each game requires you to simultaneously solve a different number of words at once: Dordle has you solving two words, Quordle four at once, Octordle eight at once, and Sedecordle a whopping 16. Good luck. You can play Dordle , Quordle , Octordle or Sedecordle on any web browser. Lewdle \"Lewdle is a game about rude words,\" this game's content advisory reads. \"If you're likely to be offended by the use of profanity, vulgarity or obscenity, it likely isn't for you.\" Translation: It's Wordle, but with bad words. The words range from mild \u2014 like poopy \u2014 to words that would make a sailor blush. Thankfully, despite this game's content warning, slurs are not included . Like Wordle, gray, yellow and green blocks are used in the same way and there's only one puzzle per day. So go forth and let the bad words flow! You can play Lewdle on any web browser. You can also download this title from Apple's App Store or the Google Play store. Antiwordle Not off to a great start with this Antiwordle puzzle. Antiwordle/CNET Tired of seeing those grey, yellow and green blocks plastered all over your social media feed? Give Antiwordle a try. While Wordle wants you to guess a word in as few tries as possible, Antiwordle wants you to avoid the word by guessing as many times as possible. When you guess, letters will turn gray, yellow or red. Gray means the letter isn't in the word and can't be used again, yellow means the letter is in the word and must be included in each subsequent guess and red means the letter is in the exact position within the word and is locked in place. If you can use every letter on the keyboard without getting the word correct, you win. Honestly, I've found this version of Wordle to be much harder than the original. You can play Antiwordle on any web browser. Absurdle Absurdle bills itself as the \"adversarial version\" of Wordle. While Wordle nudges you in the right direction with each guess, Absurdle is trying to avoid giving you the correct answer. According to the game's website, \"With each guess, Absurdle reveals as little information as possible, changing the secret word if need be.\" Absurdle doesn't pick a word at the beginning of the game for the player to guess. Instead, it uses the player's guesses to narrow its list of words down in an effort to make the game go as long as possible. The final word might not even include a yellow letter from one of your earlier guesses either. You can guess as many times as you want, which is helpful, and the best score you can get is four. Have fun! You can play Absurdle on any web browser. For more word game fun, check out CNET's Wordle tips , the best Wordle jokes and everything you need to know about the word game .

A link in the message points to a realistic website where you are asked to enter more details and make a small payment\u2014while behind the scenes, cybercriminals hoover up your information and credit card digits in real time. These messages originate from one prolific collection of loosely linked cybercriminals: \u201csmishing\u201d syndicates. This article is part of WIRED's Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of . You can read the rest of the series here . Over the past three years, these Chinese-speaking fraudsters have developed and operated the world\u2019s foremost smishing operation, spamming millions of people with text messages and likely stealing millions of dollars in the process. The term \u201csmishing\u201d is a mashup of SMS and phishing emails , which try to trick people into handing over personal details. Text messages, though, add a layer of urgency and may catch people off-guard as they go about their busy day. Now, these groups are quickly adapting their methods and expanding their scamming, security experts say. \u201cThey operate very similar to a [legitimate] business in a lot of ways,\u201d says Grant Smith, the founder of offensive cybersecurity firm Phantom Security who last year hacked one Chinese-language group and uncovered how its internal phishing kits function. \u201cThe vast majority of the kits I see nowadays are surprisingly well put together,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey are constantly developing these, constantly updating them, making them look better, making them more secure.\u201d Multiple Chinese-speaking smishing groups and individual actors are involved in the ongoing development of new techniques and running the large-scale fraud. Often, groups will even sell the kits they develop to less sophisticated cybercriminals to easily operate. Ford Merrill, a security researcher at SecAlliance, part of the CSIS Security Group, has been tracking the syndicates for two years and says there are now seven \u201cmajor\u201d Chinese \u201cphishing-as-a-service\u201d actors. \u201cThey have been enabling global SMS-based phishing campaigns at a massive scale since early 2023 onwards,\u201d he tells WIRED. Criminals will create websites impersonating companies or brands\u2014such as postal services, tax authorities, telecoms, utilities companies, and increasingly payment providers\u2014and then send texts (either SMS, encrypted iMessage, or RCS) that entice people to enter their personal information and bank cards on the fraudulent websites. This process requires the fraudsters to register thousands of domains and use Apple iCloud accounts. One of the most prominent of the smishing actors is often referred to as the Smishing Triad\u2014although security researchers group Chinese-speaking threat actors and affiliates in different ways\u2014which has impersonated organizations and brands in at least 121 countries, according to recent research by security company Silent Push. Around 200,000 domains have been used by the group in recent years, the research says, with around 187 top-level domains\u2014such as .top, .world, and .vip\u2014being used. Across one recent 20-day period, there were more than 1 million page visits to scam websites used by the Smishing Triad, according to Silent Push. Besides collecting names, emails, addresses, and bank card details, the websites also prompt people to enter one-time passwords or authentication codes that allow the criminals to add bank cards to Apple Pay or Google Wallet , allowing them to use the cards while on the other side of the world. \u201cThey have effectively turned the modern digital wallet, like Apple Pay or Google Wallet, into the best card-cloning device we\u2019ve ever invented,\u201d Merrill says. In Telegram groups linked to the cybercriminal organizations, some members share photos and videos of bank cards being added to digital wallets on iPhones and Androids. For instance, in one video, scammers allegedly show off dozens of virtual cards that they have added to phones they are using. Merrill says the criminals may not make payments using the cards they\u2019ve added to digital wallets straightaway, but it probably won\u2019t take long. \u201cWhen we first started seeing this, they would wait between 60 and 90 days before actually stealing money from the cards,\u201d he explains, adding that at first the criminals would let the cards \u201cage\u201d on a device in an attempt to look legitimate. \u201cNowadays you would be lucky if they wait seven days or even a couple days. Once they hit the card, they hit it hard and fast.\u201d \u201cSecurity is core to the Google Wallet experience, and we work closely with card issuers to prevent fraud,\u201d says Google communications manager Olivia O'Brien. \u201cFor example, banks notify customers when their card has been added to a new Wallet, and we provide signals to help issuers detect fraudulent behavior so they can decide whether to approve added cards.\u201d Apple did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. The giant scam ecosystem is powered in part by commercial underground scamming services. Findings from security firm Resecurity , which has tracked the Smishing Triad for more than two years, says the group has been using \u201cbulk\u201d SMS and message-sending services as it has expanded the number of messages it sends. Meanwhile, as multiple security researchers have noted, the Smishing Triad group also uses its own software, called Lighthouse, to collect, manage, and store people's personal information and card details. A video of the Lighthouse software originally shared on Telegram and republished by Silent Push shows how the system collects card details. The latest version of the software, which was updated in March this year, \u201ctargets dozens of financial brands\u201d including PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe, Silent Push says . In addition, the research says, Australian banking brands appear to be impersonated, indicating a potential further expansion of targets. The smishing groups are constantly improving their own scamming software. Smith, the researcher who hacked a smishing gang, says he has seen groups operating their own development pipelines for their software and systems. \u201cRecently they were using some custom-made software that they had to basically replicate Jira and have tickets open for any issues with the platform and any customer complaints,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey would assign them to team members.\u201d Chinese smishing groups do not appear to be slowing down. The cybercriminals are behind huge waves of toll road text scams sweeping across the United States this year, says Shawn Loveland, the chief operating officer at Resecurity. \u201cThey\u2019re increasing in their scale and their volume of attacks,\u201d he says. Loveland says there may be multiple ways to limit the effectiveness of smishing operations. Domain registrars could get better at detecting fraudulent websites, for example, and improved spam filtering on messages would help potential victims. Plus, law enforcement could target the platforms and systems they use to create accounts and send messages. Making it harder for smishing groups to successfully operate could reduce profits and have a cooling effect on the surging criminal ecosystem, Loveland says. \u201cCriminals have a supply chain, and you don't have to go after all the components in the supply chain,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can go after choke points in the supply chain.\u201d You Might Also Like \u2026 In your inbox: Will Knight's AI Lab explores advances in AI The Trump tariffs are how everything works now Big Story: If Anthropic succeeds , a nation of benevolent AI geniuses could be born Scientists claim to have brought back the dire wolf Special Edition: The most dangerous hackers you\u2019ve never heard of Matt Burgess is a senior writer at WIRED focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in Europe.

Rod McCarthy, group managing director of Exertis IT , said the deal would add more depth to its circular economy offering alongside its MTR business: \u201cThe acquisition of Group 8 is a fantastic addition to Exertis IT\u2019s group service strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWith circular economy regulations on the horizon, Group 8 joining our business is an integral part of our strategy to progress our business, and those of our customers\u2019, into the second life market.\u201d Group 8 business owners Terry Fannin, Veronica Child and David Meehan will continue working in the business. Focus Group: A desire to strengthen a position in vertical markets, particularly in the legal and education sectors, was the main motivation for the deal to pick up Matrix247 . The tie-up will generate a group with a combined team of more than 1,000 experts, and add more depth to the Focus business proposition. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome the Matrix247 team on board,\u201d said Neil Hall, CEO at Focus Group . \u201cThe team\u2019s technical and service capabilities have resulted in an excellent rate of growth for the business, and they have an enviable ability to attract and convert new customers, while confidently delivering and supporting new implementations. We\u2019re eager to continue building upon this success and the partnership will further enhance our CCaaS and Managed IT offering for the wider group.\u201d Matrix247 will continue to operate under its respective brand name for now, and the firm is viewing the acquisition as a chance to provide significant opportunities. Stephen Pritchard, CEO of Matrix247, said: \u201cJoining forces with Focus Group is an exciting step forward for Matrix247. It\u2019s clear we share a like-minded vision, and this partnership enables us to leverage the combined strengths of Matrix247\u2019s and Focus Group\u2019s proficiency in comms, IT and cyber security.\u201d Read more on Managed IT Services Channel catch-up: News in brief By: Simon Quicke Questions over the future of Exertis as DCC signals break-up By: Simon Quicke Channel roundup: Who's gone where?

Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City\u2019s Housing Shortage The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index extended declines for a fifth day, falling a total of 3.3% during that stretch. While Treasuries and stocks rallied on news that President Donald Trump will delay levies on some popular consumer electronics, sentiment on the dollar was undermined by his warnings that the exemption will prove temporary. Protracted selloffs in the greenback and Treasuries \u2014 typically seen as havens in turbulent times \u2014 have exacerbated concerns that investors are lightening up on US assets in the face of tectonic trade policy shifts and broader political uncertainty. Listen to the Here\u2019s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Weakness in the dollar and Treasuries is a \u201chorrible, toxic combination,\u201d said Jordan Rochester, head of macro strategy for EMEA at Mizuho International Plc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index finished Monday down 0.3%. The gauge has fallen about 6.1% so far this year, on track for its biggest annual loss since 2017. Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Positioning in the options market suggested traders were hedging against further declines. An index measuring three-month risk reversals \u2014 or the spread between call and put options \u2014 on the dollar against its major peers has dropped to a five-year low. That indicates greater demand for put options that would benefit from a weaker dollar than for call options that would gain from a stronger one. The S&P 500 index gained 0.8% on Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 4.38%. A five-day bond market selloff unleashed by anxiety over Trump\u2019s trade war sent 10-year Treasury yields to the biggest weekly surge in over two decades last week. Lasting damage? The discussion that has dominated Wall Street for much of the past week has centered on whether Trump\u2019s actions, even if they are eventually reversed, have inflicted lasting damage to the idea that the US dollar and Treasuries are the ultimate risk-free assets. \u201cWe are talking about a regime change in the way the market views the dollar, particularly during times of global financial stress,\u201d Steve Barrow, a strategist at Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019d note that the other key component of the US\u2019s safe-asset allure \u2013 the Treasury market \u2013 has not been particularly safe.\u201d Story Continues That view was echoed by Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at MUFG Bank, who focused on weekend remarks from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressing a longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the technology sector. \u201cIt is difficult to see any fundamental factor that will likely improve investor sentiment,\u201d Halpenny wrote in a report. \u201cKey levels were broken last week for the dollar.\u201d One-week risk reversals on the Bloomberg dollar index moved toward parity for the first time in five days, a sign that traders are becoming less bearish on the greenback. Still, the gauge has remained in negative territory for a third straight day, with bearish sentiment toward the US currency at levels unseen since the pandemic. \u201cTrump\u2019s actions have persistently damaged the \u2018US brand\u2019,\u201d wrote Dana Malas, a strategist at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. \u201cThis means that dollar assets, both inside and outside the US, should continue to carry higher risk premiums.\u201d Almost 80% of respondents to a Bloomberg survey predicted the dollar would weaken further over the next month, the biggest proportion of bears since the surveys began in 2022. Strategists at the biggest Wall Street banks also see the potential for further weakness. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts suggested investors remain bearish the dollar, especially against the yen and euro, as there\u2019s still a chance of a US recession. Mizuho Bank Ltd. anticipates the US currency may fall another 5% on a trade-weighted basis before rebounding, based on how it traded in 2017-18 and during the pandemic. \u201cThe design and implementation of these tariffs should have a negative impact on the currency because they have contributed to eroding consumer and business confidence,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Kamakshya Trivedi wrote. \u201cIf tariffs weigh on US firms\u2019 profit margins and US consumers\u2019 real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar,\u201d they said. --With assistance from Michael G.

The Argentine star's contract expires at the end of 2025 and he could soon sign a new deal that would keep him at the club until at least the end of 2026 JUAN CASTRO RYAN MITCHELL Actualizado 14/04/2025 - 04:52 CDT Compartir en Facebook Compartir en Twitter Compartir en Telegram Compartir en Whatsapp Enviar por email L eo Messi's contract expires in December 2025... and Inter Miami intends to renew it as soon as possible in order to ensure his presence at the inauguration of the new stadium , Freedom Park, the club's new 'home' which is under advanced construction. For the club, the new venue is the most crucial element strategically for the near future. Lionel Messi and the Herons stay scoreless I Chicago 0-0 Inter Miami I Highlights and goals I MLS MLS APPLE TV MARCA confirms that there have already been contacts between the parties. In fact, they have been taking place for quite a few months, as the relationship between the directors and the Messi family is quite good. In addition, Leo and his family are very happy in Miami. And Inter, of course, are 100% happy to have the star in their ranks. The Argentine's presence has meant an exponential growth of the club in absolutely everything, from sporting to economic terms. Therefore, it does not seem difficult that the agreement will be sealed at some point in the coming months... perhaps even before the summer. However, it remains to be seen whether Leo's renewal would mean extending the contract by one year or whether, on the contrary, it is a longer-term agreement. In any case, whatever the length, the new contract will also offer hope that Leo will play in the 2026 World Cup, something that almost everyone takes for granted, but which is not official and will depend on the \"day to day\", as Leo himself has pointed out on countless occasions. But... what if Leo did not stay in Miami? The options seem few, with Saudi Arabia as the main candidate. But 'Saudi' has a difficult task. Messi and Miami is a happy combination and the Albiceleste captain has said it on several occasions: \"I would like to finish my career in Miami.\" Anything other than continuing his career beyond 2025 in a league other than MLS would therefore be more than a surprise Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who could soon renew for two years with Al Nassr until September 2027, have personalized the pinnacle of football in the last 20 years . 'Cris', almost two and a half years older than Leo, was already appearing at Euro 2004 in his country, while the Argentine's first major event (senior, not youth or Olympic) was the 2006 World Cup in Germany Their relevance remains important in the contexts in which they play: Messi with Inter Miami and Argentina (where he remains an essential player); and Cristiano with Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr and Portugal. So much so that, barring injury, both players aspire to be the only players in history to play in their sixth World Cup in 2026 (there are eight players who have five, but none with six).

Charles Gasparino / @cgasparino : Scoop: There is significant division inside the @WhiteHouse over @howardlutnick 's comments on the temporary nature of the tariff exemptions, an apparent 180 from where the world thought the trade negotiations were going, sources tell me. Of course the only opinion that really matters in the president's but I am told plenty of people really believe he is \u201coff message\u201d of trying to create a trade regime that involves negotiations even with China and actions that don't roil the markets including the all important bond market. This story is developing Aaron Levie / @levie : We will need AGI to be invented just to figure out what products are actually tariffed Dan Primack / @danprimack : The problem is that Lutnick, Bessent, Navarro and Hassett keep getting interviewed individually.

Aaron Rupar / @atrupar : KARL: So you're saying that the big tariffs on things like smartphones and laptops, all those iPhones built in China, that those tariffs are temporarily off but they're gonna be coming right back on in another form in a month or so? LUTNICK: Correct. That's right. Semiconductors and pharmaceuticals will have a tariff model in order to encourage them to reshore. @zerohedge : Howard Lutnick tells ABC that tariff exemptions for electronics are only temporary, and these items would be subject to \u201csemiconductor tariffs\u201d that will likely come in \u201ca month or two\u201d: ABC Nick Denton / @nicknotned : I get that Trump likes his ministers to fight it out, before picking his position of the day.

An internal assessment memo from a major unnamed Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia highlights how game consoles made in China are still subject to a 145% tariff in the United States, which means that the Nintendo Switch 2, which is primarily made in China, is in line for a significant price increase over the announced launch price of $449.99. The PlayStation 5 is also primarily made in China, so a price hike in the United States is also expected for Sony's system, which has already seen a price increase in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Related Story Wii Sports Was Free Because Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 Fought For It, And He Seems To Think Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Should Be Free Too As Nikkei Asia pointed out in today's report, the Nintendo Switch 2 is also being produced in Vietnam. Last week , we learned that Hosiden Corp shipped quite a few units to the United States last February, more than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. Judging from today's report, however, it seems more and more unlikely that the number of units produced in Vietnam will be enough to prevent the system's price from increasing, given the vast majority of units are still produced in China. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for China, where the console has been delayed indefinitely .

The CA/Browser Forum ballot result will impact all businesses with a website, meaning they must replace their public TLS certificates more frequently than the current maximum of 398 days. On March 15 2026, the TLS certificate lifespan will shrink to 200 days, then a year after that to 100 days. On March 15 2029, it will drop to 47 days. Shortening the lifespan of digital certificates in this way reduces the amount of time a threat actor has to take advantage of a compromised certificate. According to certificate authority (CA) Sectigo, the move could also help to spur greater adoption of automation in the certificate management and renewal sector, reducing manual error and embedding best practice into more organizations. Read more on digital certificates: CIOs Raise the Alarm Over TLS Cert Security Risks The CA argued that it might also spur crypto agility by accelerating the adoption of stronger algorithms and ensuring compliance with evolving security standards. That will stand organizations in better stead as they prepare for the transition to quantum-safe algorithms. \u201cThe industry\u2019s unified support for reducing certificate lifespans to 47 days reflects a shared commitment to enhancing digital security and trust for all,\u201d said Tim Callan, chief compliance officer at Sectigo and vice-chair of the CA/Browser Forum. \u201cThis pivotal and positive advancement for our industry underscores the importance of agility and proactive risk management in today\u2019s threat landscape while preparing for the risks of the quantum era.\u201d However, experts have argued in the past that many organizations will need to adopt machine identity automation tools to manage these risks \u2013 especially as the number of such \u2018identities\u2019 continues to explode thanks to digital transformation.

News of the surge comes after the Irish data protection watchdog announced a fresh investigation into Elon Musk\u2019s AI engine, Grok AI, over whether it has legally trained its systems on European users\u2019 private data. Two weeks ago, OpenAI announced the largest funding round in history, a $40bn (\u20ac35.1bn) raise that values the firm at $300bn (\u20ac263bn). Speaking at a Ted conference in the US over the weekend, Mr Altman said that the service\u2019s growth curve is steep. \u201cIt\u2019s growing very fast,\u201d he told the curator of the Ted conference, Chris Anderson. \u201cSomething like 10pc of the world uses our systems now.\u201d ChatGPT recently introduced a feature that allows for image generation from real photos in styles which include the Japanese film animation company Studio Ghibli. The feature has become a worldwide trending hit. OpenAI\u2019s office in Dublin hosts operations, trust and safety, security engineering, marketing and legal activities. Last year, the company appointed Northern Irish tech executive Sarah Friar as its chief financial officer. AI systems from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and Meta are currently locked in a battle for dominance, with each tech giant pledging tens of billions of annual funding to build what is projected to be the most important technology of the near future. Other AI systems vying for attention include Anthropic, Perplexity, Chinese-owned Deepseek, French-based Mistral and Elon Musk-owned Grok AI. Apple shares were negatively impacted in March after the company announced that it would need to delay the rollout of key features of its own AI system, Apple Intelligence, by a year. On Friday, the Data Protection Commission announced an inquiry into whether Elon Musk\u2019s X platform has been improperly harvesting EU users\u2019 posts to train his Grok AI system. The watchdog, which has hit big tech firms with fines of almost \u20ac3bn in the last three years, said that the probe would examine \u201cpublicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU [and] EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models, in particular the Grok Large Language Models (LLMs). The inquiry will examine compliance with a range of key provisions of the GDPR, including with regard to the lawfulness and transparency of the processing.\u201d Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news Latest Technology All \u2018public\u2019 Facebook and Instagram posts and photos by Irish and European users to be switched on for Meta\u2019s AI-training system One in ten people now use ChatGPT \u2018We\u2019re going from driving a Passat to driving a Porsche\u2019 \u2013 Athlone\u2019s Zenith Adhesive bought by PE-backed US life sciences group Meta adds Stripe CEO Patrick Collison to board of directors AI medical models \u2018advise treatments based on real-world biases\u2019 Steve Dempsey: AI wants us to forget that hard graft is much more than a means to an end LIVE | Donald Trump announces 90-day pause on tariffs on EU and others \u2018effective immediately\u2019; China now subject to 125pc levy No livestreaming by teen Instagram accounts under updated parental controls The Big Tech Show: TikTok, Tariffs, Trump and an uncertain future for Ireland's tech sector New 3D-printed imitation skin \u2018could take the place of animals in testing of cosmetics\u2019, scientists say Show more Top Stories Business Gap between living standards in Northern Ireland and the Republic widening, ESRI report finds The Indo Daily The Indo Daily: Solving a notorious cold case: The three major clues in \u2018Ice House\u2019 murder of Irene White Life \u2018The drug that changed it for me was benzodiazepine\u2026 then I realised I couldn\u2019t control it anymore\u2019 \u2013 Dean Duggan on addiction Ireland Catherine Fulvio: \u2018I wanted to do something that wasn\u2019t Ballyknocken.

Home News You are here OnePlus 13T benchmark leak puts it toe-to-toe with Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max By Iskra Petrova Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 6:06 AM 1 comment Follow us on Google News OnePlus Up Next: The OnePlus 13 . | Image Credit - PhoneArena A new Geekbench listing has been spotted showing us how the OnePlus 13T may fare in terms of performance, and corroborating expectations about the chip powering the phone. OnePlus, despite earlier saying it won't release any more T-branded flagships, appears to have changed its mind. The OnePlus 13T is now gearing up for launch and has recently been spotted sporting a light pink color. Now, it's made a visit to Geekbench . The OnePlus 13T's listing on the benchmarking website confirms earlier rumors that it will sport the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the current flagship processor by Qualcomm. The entry also reveals the flagship having 16GB of RAM (something that the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max can't boast about). The device appears listed under model number PKX110 and has managed to score 2,900 in single and 8,934 in multi-core tests. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, it comes with the Adreno 830 GPU and Android 15 . The OnePlus 13T's score is similar to the OnePlus 13 , which managed 3,026 in single and 9,036 in multi-core, so the 13T comes reliably bringing flagship-level performance.

Geekbench 6 Single Higher is better Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 3137 Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 3331 OnePlus 13 2967 Geekbench 6 Multi Higher is better Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 9769 Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 8106 OnePlus 13 9081 View all For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max got 3,331 in single and 8,106 in multi on Geekbench, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra managed 3,137 in single and 9,769 in multi. As you can see, the OnePLus 13T managed to outrun the iPhone 16 Pro Max in multi-core but lost in single. Still, it is slightly less powerful than the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite in the Galaxy. It's worth noting that these benchmark results don't always accurately reflect real-life performance. These numbers are all pretty high anyway and both the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra are incredibly snappy and powerful devices. It's great that the OnePlus 13T will join them up there, at least judging by these results. Earlier, the phone's scores on AnTuTu also leaked, showing another set of promising results from the upcoming phone. Also, the phone has recently leaked again. Reputable tipster Digital Chat Station shared an image of the OnePlus 13T (potentially) on Chinese social media website Weibo, and we can see a bold new design and sophisticated look: Recommended Stories Potentially the OnePlus 13T. | Image Credit - Digital Chat Station There's no longer the circular camera island and now we may have more of a square-shaped camera bump. The phone is expected to feature a triple camera setup with a 50MP primary camera and a 50MP 2x telephoto camera. The third camera is said to be an ultra-wide one. Digital Chat Station also mentioned the phone may be available in three color options: a black variant, a light pink one ( which leaked not too long ago ), and a gray one. It is not clear if one of these three will be reserved for the Chinese market or if all three will be available globally. The OnePlus 13T will debut initially in China and will likely get a global release at a later date. The phone will likely pack a huge battery cell under the hood. Rumors say it may be a 6,200mAh battery. The battery of this bad boy is confirmed by OnePlus itself to be at least 6,000mAh , but the exact number has not been confirmed just yet. The OnePlus 13T is expected to battle the best for the title of the best phone of 2025. It has the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra to face, and the Ultra by Samsung comes with an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite and a refined design, but not too many insane upgrades this year. Also, another competitor of the OnePlus 13T is the iPhone 16 Pro , although the iPhone 16 models have gotten themselves into some huge controversy recently by the fact that Apple has delayed the promised Apple Intelligent Siri.

With reports of innovative features and design enhancements, these earbuds might redefine how you experience audio, monitor your health, and communicate. Below is a detailed breakdown of the five most intriguing leaks, offering a clearer perspective on what to expect in a new video from Matt Talks Tech. Watch this video on YouTube . 1. A Redesigned Look with Advanced Features Apple appears to be reimagining the AirPods Pro design, with one of the most notable rumors being the introduction of a sleek black color option. This would provide a stylish alternative to the traditional white, appealing to users seeking a more modern aesthetic. Beyond aesthetics, speculation suggests the inclusion of mini cameras embedded in the earbuds. These cameras could enable advanced object recognition, allowing you to point your AirPods at an object and receive instant information via Siri. If realized, this feature could significantly enhance how you interact with your surroundings, merging convenience with innovative technology. 2. Enhanced Active Noise Cancellation For users who value immersive audio experiences, the AirPods Pro 3 may deliver a substantial upgrade. Reports indicate that Apple plans to double the strength of active noise cancellation compared to the AirPods Pro 2. This improvement could provide even greater isolation from ambient noise, making it ideal for environments such as crowded commutes, bustling offices, or long-haul flights. Additionally, enhanced noise cancellation is expected to improve call clarity, making sure your conversations remain crisp and uninterrupted, even in noisy settings. This feature could appeal to professionals and casual users alike, offering a more seamless audio experience. 3. Advanced Health Monitoring Capabilities The AirPods Pro 3 might evolve beyond being just earbuds, potentially serving as a personal health assistant . Leaks suggest the addition of a heart rate monitor, similar to the one found in the Powerbeats Pro 2, allowing users to track cardiovascular activity during workouts or throughout the day. Another rumored feature is body temperature monitoring, achieved through integrated sensors. These health tools could provide valuable insights into your well-being, seamlessly integrating into your daily routine without requiring separate devices. For fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious individuals, these features could offer a convenient way to stay informed about their physical condition. 4. Real-Time Language Translation Traveling abroad could become significantly easier with the AirPods Pro 3, thanks to rumored real-time language translation capabilities. When paired with your iPhone, the earbuds could deliver translations directly to your ears, allowing you to engage in conversations across language barriers effortlessly. This feature could prove invaluable for international travelers, business professionals, and anyone navigating multilingual environments. If implemented effectively, it could transform global communication, making it more accessible and intuitive than ever before. 5. Anticipated Launch and Pricing The AirPods Pro 3 are expected to launch in September, alongside the iPhone 17, with availability shortly thereafter. However, these advanced features may come with a higher price tag. Rumors suggest the earbuds could cost over $300 , influenced by factors such as tariffs and optional features like mini cameras. While the premium pricing might deter some buyers, the enhanced functionality and innovative features could justify the cost for those seeking state-of-the-art technology. For users prioritizing quality and versatility, the AirPods Pro 3 could represent a worthwhile investment. What These Leaks Indicate The AirPods Pro 3 could signify a major evolution in wearable technology, offering features that cater to diverse user needs. Whether you\u2019re an audiophile seeking superior sound quality, a fitness enthusiast monitoring your health, or a traveler breaking down language barriers, these earbuds might deliver a comprehensive solution. While the official announcement is still pending, the leaks provide an exciting glimpse into what could be Apple\u2019s most advanced earbuds to date.

Or so we think : the whole business has been massively obfuscated by that special blend of state secrecy and legal gaggery that characterizes an official attempt to do something we really need to know about without telling us. Sooner or later, that scent escapes the kitchen and we know something's cooking. In this case, although nobody actually involved would or could say anything, privacy campaigners and journalists got wind that the UK's Home Office had issued a secret demand that Apple put a back door into its top level none-but-you-and-God iCloud secrecy. Rather than comply, Apple yanked the capability from British users, an action far more eloquent than a press release. It also - we think - appealed the original order. We only think this, because any such appeal can also be secret if the Home Secretary says it should be, and a special independent tribunal agrees with them. Last week, the tribunal decided this was a bad idea, denying the official request for a secret court. The tribunal also said it didn't want to say no because it really likes the Home Office (the UK version of Homeland Security), which says a lot about its independence and the weakness of the government's case. As this case will rest on two impossible things, 1) that any backdoor can be kept secret and 2) that state cybersecurity guarding it will be perfect, sinking our teeth into that nugget of truth will be tasty. Which is good. Secret courts have no place in a democracy. They are officially excused because of cases involving official secrets that would be compromised if produced in open court. But if the case is that the defendant has compromised that information, then it's already compromised, presumably to the very people the secret court is trying to keep in the dark. Otherwise, make the case in public. Details vary by jurisdiction, but individuals at risk can be kept anonymous, evidence produced with redactions, records kept under seal, and so on, but all these are visible and amenable to challenge. It is to the UK's credit that its own secret courts can be unzipped and to its discredit that they exist at all. If you can't prosecute in public, don't prosecute at all. It galls that the guilty go free, but the ability to hide sins at the expense of innocence weighs much heavier. The cover-up is worse than the crime, and secret courts provide a banquet of opportunity for that. In fact, abusing the mechanisms of state security is such a good indicator of bad behavior, it could and should be a crime in its own right. The dark gothic manoeuvers of US President Donald Trump in shutting down criticism seemingly by a combination of punishment by diktat and perverting the invocation of freedom of speech is an exemplar for the ages. He didn't like that there was no evidence of interference with the 2020 US presidential election he lost to Joe Biden, and he especially didn't like that CISA, the cybersecurity agency he asked to produce such evidence, said it couldn't because there wasn't any. In the few weeks left to him at the time, he fired the agency head, Chris Krebs. Now he's back, he's opening a criminal investigation on whether Krebs suppressed freedom of speech by working with social media to reduce misinformation, and revoking not only Krebs' security clearance but that of the entire organization he set up after he was fired. The freedom of speech abuse is bad enough: social media companies constantly promote and downrate what people say in them by unregulated and invisible algorithms, and set rules of acceptable content that users can agree to or go elsewhere. You can say what you like, there's no legal compulsion on a publisher to accept or amplify it. Krebs had no legal power to compel anything here, but a duty to understand and discuss with the companies the harmful effects that deliberate disinformation campaigns could have on the security of the US. By removing his security clearance, and the security clearances within his company, Trump is not only removing his livelihood and thus his ability to defend himself, but sending a chilling message to anyone else who might put duty to truth above loyalty to the Beautiful Leader. Security classification is more complex and nuanced than you might think. It's open to abuse. Its use as a direct, open and shameless weapon of persecution against personal disloyalty is new and heinous. Apple's alleged UK encryption battle sparks political and privacy backlash Just declassified: US senator caught up in Section 702 FBI surveillance dragnet 10 years after Snowden's first leak, what have we learned? No day in court: US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rulings will stay a secret The closest analogy is how the House Un-American Activities Committee under Senator Joseph McCarthy persecuted thousands of people in the mid-decades of the last century for the presumed crime of being communists through innuendo and denouncements. While this was a perversion of government power and McCarthy ended up censured, and although it harmed individuals and America, at the time it enjoyed the figleaves of process and the excuse of a known hostile ideology. Trump's action is one man using the state to attack anyone he feels like, unfiltered, while musing openly about setting the Constitution aside , and using primary tools like funding and security clearance to escape oversight and control. That's an order of magnitude worse. Both this and the attempt by the UK government to hush up its mistaken assumption that state security can be made perfect are abuses of security, made in the assumption that there is no comeback. That the nature of security in the digital age has changed is reflected by many new laws of the past 40 years. That this new nature puts extra responsibilities on those who ultimately control it has not. We need recognition that abuse of the mechanisms of security by the state has much greater consequences now than before, legal recognition with teeth. It may not stop such abuse, but it would be a powerful tool to counter it when it happens. Digital secrecy is a new and powerful beast that is only now revealing itself. We must know its nature, and how best to tame it. \u00ae Get our Tech Resources Share More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense More like these \u00d7 More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense Narrower topics Cabinet Office Competition and Markets Authority Computer Misuse Act DARPA DCMS GCHQ HMRC Home Office ICO NCSC NHS NSA RPA Broader topics Federal government of the United States Government United Kingdom More about Share 111 COMMENTS More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense More like these \u00d7 More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense Narrower topics Cabinet Office Competition and Markets Authority Computer Misuse Act DARPA DCMS GCHQ HMRC Home Office ICO NCSC NHS NSA RPA Broader topics Federal government of the United States Government United Kingdom TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like UK's answer to DARPA sprouts new ideas, like programmable plants Updated programs suggest ARIA will keep singing for another year Science 9 Apr 2025 | 29 Brit universities told to keep up the world-class research with less cash Government boasts of \u00a314B in R&D spending, but grant body takes \u00a3300M hit Science 8 Apr 2025 | 56 UK stats body snoozes legacy tech overhaul as Treasury tightens purse strings ONS acknowledges it might be a costly decision in the long run On-Prem 7 Apr 2025 | 15 Data deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI Harnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important Sponsored Feature Home Office haunted by 25-year-old asylum system 'Full benefit' of replacement will not be realized until old one is shut down, projects watchdog warns Databases 4 Apr 2025 | 52 Signalgate: Pentagon watchdog probes Defense Sec Hegseth Classification compliance?

These items were temporarily spared from the 125% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods and the broader 10% global levy. ETtech US President Donald Trump is preparing to impose fresh tariffs on semiconductors , with an announcement expected within the next week. The move marks a reversal from temporary relief granted to key electronics items, and reflects his push to tackle what he calls unfair trade practices \u2014 especially by China. Trump confirmed that semiconductor tariffs would come in the \u201cnot distant future,\u201d adding that there would be \u201csome flexibility\u201d for select companies. While the president gave no specifics, he said a separate announcement on products like iPhones would follow soon. Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote: \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\u201d Temporary relief for tech firms Just days earlier, the Trump administration had issued tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, memory chips, hard drives, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. These products were excluded from the 125% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports, as well as the 10% baseline global tariff. Live Events The temporary relief was designed to shield US consumers from inflation and prevent further disruption to supply chains. Major tech firms like Apple , Nvidia, and Samsung benefited from the pause, given their deep dependence on Chinese suppliers. Chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor also gained from exemptions on specialised equipment.

Trump reaffirmed that no country, particularly China, would be spared from upcoming duties. A national security-focused trade investigation into chips and semiconductors is already underway. Push to reduce reliance on China \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, as reported by CNN. \u201cAt the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d But for firms like Apple, shifting manufacturing out of China remains a long-term effort. Despite efforts to diversify, around 90% of iPhones are still assembled in China. India has emerged as a key alternative. Since March, Apple has flown more than 600 tonnes of iPhones from its Indian factories, anticipating tariff disruptions. Also Read: China gains on electronics, but India still wins According to India\u2019s Minister for electronics and information technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Apple exported iPhones worth over Rs 1.5 trillion from India in the financial year ended March 2025. Higher prices Analysts from AP warn that fresh tariffs could significantly raise prices for US consumers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max, for instance, could see a price hike of up to 29%, pushing the base model from $1,200 to $1,550. Fully moving production to the US could push retail prices above $3,000 \u2014 a level experts say is unsustainable. China\u2019s counterbalance While China was excluded from the most recent tariff exemptions, it is taking a different route. President Xi Jinping is expected to visit Southeast Asia soon to strengthen regional trade ties, positioning Beijing as a counterweight to Washington\u2019s increasingly aggressive trade stance.

This guide explains how to install macOS on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using nested virtualization. Prerequisites Google Cloud Platform account Basic familiarity with command line and cloud environments gcloud CLI installed on your local machine Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud CLI If you haven\u2019t already installed the Google Cloud CLI, follow the official installation guide : After installation, authenticate with your Google Cloud account: gcloud init Follow the prompts to select your project and set default configurations. Step 2: Create a VM Instance with Appropriate Specifications Create a new virtual machine with sufficient resources to run macOS: gcloud compute instances create macos \\ --zone=asia-southeast1-b \\ --min-cpu-platform=\"Intel Cascade Lake\" \\ --machine-type=n2-standard-8 \\ --image-family=ubuntu-2204-lts \\ --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \\ --boot-disk-size=200GB \\ --boot-disk-type=pd-ssd Note: You may need to adjust the machine type, disk size, and zone based on your requirements and available regions. You need to use an Intel-based machine type to enable Nested Virtualization. Step 3: Enable Nested Virtualization Export the VM configuration to a YAML file: gcloud compute instances export macos \\ --destination=macos.yml \\ --zone=asia-southeast1-b Edit the YAML file to enable nested virtualization. Add or modify the following section: advancedMachineFeatures: enableNestedVirtualization: true Update the VM with the new configuration: gcloud compute instances update-from-file macos \\ --source=macos.yml \\ --most-disruptive-allowed-action=RESTART \\ --zone=asia-southeast1-b This will restart your instance with nested virtualization enabled. Step 4: Connect to Your VM and Verify Nested Virtualization Connect to your VM via SSH: gcloud compute ssh macos Verify that nested virtualization is enabled: grep -cw vmx /proc/cpuinfo Any response greater than 0 confirms that nested virtualization is enabled. Step 5: Install Ubuntu Desktop Environment (Required) Installing a desktop environment is mandatory for this setup. Here\u2019s a summary of the installation process: Install Chrome Remote Desktop : sudo apt update wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb sudo apt-get install --assume-yes ./chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb 2. Update your system and install SLiM display manager: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install slim 3. Install Ubuntu desktop environment: sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop 4. Reboot the machine and restart SSH connection: sudo reboot 5. After reconnecting via SSH, start the SLiM service: sudo service slim start 6. Configure Chrome Remote Desktop service to connect to your Ubuntu Desktop. For detailed instructions on setting up and connecting to your Ubuntu Desktop, follow the official guide . From step 6 onward, you will use Chrome Remote Desktop to operate the newly created virtual machine. You can see more detailed instructions on quickemu\u2019s Wiki . Step 6: Install Quickemu Access VM with Chrome Remote Desktop, and run these commands to install quickemu (quickget will also be installed): sudo apt-add-repository ppa:flexiondotorg/quickemu sudo apt update sudo apt install quickemu -y Step 7: Create and Configure macOS Virtual Machine Use quickget to automatically download a macOS recovery image and create a virtual machine configuration. quickget macos big-sur This will download the macOS recovery image and set up the virtual machine configuration. macOS mojave , catalina , big-sur , monterey , ventura and sonoma are supported. Once the download is complete, a *.conf file will be created. For example, macos-big-sur.conf . Open that file and edit or add the following line: ram=16G Step 8: Start the macOS Installation Launch the virtual machine: sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm quickemu --vm macos-big-sur.conf Use cursor keys and enter key to select the macOS Base System From macOS Utilities Click Disk Utility and Continue Select Apple Inc. VirtIO Block Device (on Big Sur and above) or select QEMU HARDDISK Media (~103.08GB) from the list and click Erase . Enter a Name: for the disk If you are installing macOS Mojave or later ( Catalina , Big Sur , Monterey , Ventura and Sonoma ), choose any of the APFS options as the filesystem. MacOS Extended may not work. Click Erase . Click Done . Close Disk Utility 3. From macOS Utilities Click Reinstall macOS and Continue 4. Complete the installation as you normally would. On the first reboot use cursor keys and enter key to select macOS Installer On the subsequent reboots use cursor keys and enter key to select the disk you named OPTIONAL (highly recommended) : After you have concluded the out-of-the-box wizard, you may want to enable the TRIM feature that the computer industry created for SSD disks. This feature in our macOS installation will allow QuickEmu to compact (shrink) your macOS disk image whenever you delete files inside the Virtual Machine. Without this step your macOS disk image will only ever get larger and will not shrink even when you delete lots of data inside macOS. To enable TRIM, open the Terminal application and type the following command followed by pressing enter to tell macos to use the TRIM command on the hard disk when files are deleted: sudo trimforce enable Apple ID Login I have successfully logged in with my Apple ID on macOS Big Sur. With newer OSs, macOS VMs will usually be blocked from logging in with Apple IDs by default. You can follow the official guide to fix this. However, there is no guarantee that it will work 100%. Good luck! Troubleshooting Common Issues Performance Issues Increase the VM\u2019s resources (CPU cores, RAM) if performance is slow Use SSD storage instead of standard persistent disks Installation Failures grep -cw vmx /proc/cpuinfo returns 0: this error is because you selected the wrong machine type. Make sure you have selected a machine type that supports Intel chips (at least Haswell or higher) KVM permission denied: Make sure you run sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm Legal Considerations Remember that running macOS on non-Apple hardware may violate Apple\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). This guide is provided for educational purposes only. Always ensure your usage complies with relevant licenses and terms of service. Conclusion You\u2019ve now set up macOS on Google Cloud Platform using nested virtualization. This setup can be useful for development, testing, and CI/CD pipelines for Apple platforms without requiring physical Apple hardware. For production use cases, consider official cloud solutions that offer macOS environments in compliance with Apple\u2019s licensing terms.

More Germany, on Monday, March 31, 2025.. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP Artificial intelligence is no longer just the future\u2014it\u2019s now the engine of the global digital economy. AI is infiltrating every sector, reshaping industries, and rewriting the rules of business. But behind this technological shift lies an uncertain reality: AI consumes enormous amounts of energy. And unless reined in, this demand could overwhelm global electricity systems. AI\u2019s Energy Appetite Is Growing Faster Than Expected According to Energy and AI , the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the electricity consumed by data centers\u2014the nerve centers of the AI revolution\u2014could more than double by 2030, surpassing 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh). That\u2019s conservative against a recent Goldman Sachs forecast that global power demand from data centers will increase 50% by 2027 and by as much as 165% by the end of the decade. At the heart of this surge are data centers\u2014the physical infrastructure that powers AI\u2019s rapid computations and learning cycles. The rise of AI workloads, including large language models and generative platforms, is driving an exponential increase in power consumption that governments, utilities, and tech giants can no longer afford to ignore. \u201cThere is no AI without electricity,\u201d warned Dr. Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA at the launch of the report. \u201cThe energy industry is caught unprepared for the speed and demands of the AI industry.\u201d AI Could Break the Grid\u2014Or Help Save It This predicted surge in energy use poses a defining challenge. But there is also a clear opportunity: if harnessed correctly, AI could become a powerful tool for cutting energy consumption and carbon emissions - by up to around 5% of global emissions. The report doesn\u2019t just warn of growing demand\u2014it highlights how AI itself could transform energy efficiency and reshape our response to climate and infrastructure pressures.

In power grids, it enhances forecasting and fault detection, allowing for better integration of renewable energy and between 30-50% fewer outages. In industry, it\u2019s optimizing operations to the point of saving as much energy as Mexico uses each year. AI-powered logistics could cut fuel use across transport systems, saving the equivalent of energy used by 120 million cars. And in the built environment\u2014often slow to modernize\u2014AI-driven controls for lighting, heating, and cooling could save 300 TWh annually, the same as Australia and New Zealand\u2019s total electricity use. In this way, AI embodies a paradox: it is both the driver of rising energy consumption and a key to reducing it. AI\u2019s New Era Of Energy-Efficient Innovation The future isn\u2019t only being shaped by demand\u2014it\u2019s also being disrupted by innovation. In early 2025, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced open-source AI models that match the performance of market leaders at a fraction of the energy cost. Its V3 model was trained for just $5.6 million, while reports put the training cost of GPT-4 at around $100 million. Breakthroughs like these are rewriting assumptions about the energy requirements of advanced AI and pointing to a more efficient path forward. Even Big Tech is reconsidering its approach. While companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have announced massive investments in data centers, analysts are reporting a trend of scaling back. In the U.S. and Europe, Microsoft is r eported to have paused several data center expansion projects. The move, spurred by efficiency gains and shifting business models, suggests the future may not be as energy-hungry as once feared. DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough in cutting computational loads hints at a new era of leaner, greener AI. That shift may be essential. \u201cAlmost half of the U.S. electricity demand growth between now and 2030 will be driven by data centers,\u201d Birol said. \u201cTo put it in context, the electricity used for AI data centers will exceed the consumption of the chemicals, steel, aluminum, and cement industries combined.\u201d That\u2019s not just a shift\u2014it\u2019s a wholesale reordering of industrial energy dynamics. It suggests that AI could become the single most dominant industrial force shaping the future of electricity grids, energy investments, and national energy security strategies. Designing AI For Efficiency, Not Excess There\u2019s growing consensus that the solution lies not in curbing technological progress, but in building smarter systems. Jakob Jul Jensen, Head of Business Development for Data Centers at Danfoss, believes the future hinges on better design. \u201cEnergy efficiency must be prioritized and integrated into every layer of data center design and operation,\u201d he says. That means smarter cooling systems, AI-driven power management, and perhaps most overlooked, heat reuse. According to the IEA, the waste heat from data centers could meet 10% of Europe\u2019s space heating needs, provided it\u2019s redirected into homes, buildings, and local industries, impacting the energy system overall. As AI investment accelerates, access to secure, affordable, and clean energy is becoming a strategic differentiator for nations. Countries able to deliver on all three will lead the AI-driven economy and attract investment from the world\u2019s most valuable companies. \u201cThe availability and cleanliness of electricity is becoming a strategic advantage,\u201d says Birol. \u201cCountries that can provide secure, clean, and affordable electricity will be one step ahead in attracting AI investment. Those that fall short risk being left behind.\" That\u2019s why the IEA is taking this moment seriously. For the first time, it\u2019s integrating AI into its annual World Energy Outlook forecasts, recalibrating how governments and industries prepare for the road ahead. \u201cEverything around, above, and under energy is our business,\u201d said Birol. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ignore this. Data always wins\u2014and our job is to put that data on the table for governments and industry to act.\u201d AI At The Crossroads Of Innovation And Sustainability And act they must. Without coordinated policies and innovation-driven strategies, AI could lock in energy inefficiencies that will be far more expensive\u2014and disruptive\u2014to fix later. But by embracing AI-powered grid management, systemic energy integration, and innovations in efficiency and reuse, there is a real chance of turning this challenge into an opportunity driving the development of a smarter, cleaner, and more resilient global energy system. Artificial intelligence is not just the next great industrial consumer of energy\u2014it\u2019s also poised to be its most transformative innovator. Whether the world leans into this dual identity will define not only the trajectory of technological progress, but the sustainability of the global energy economy itself. The question is no longer if AI will reshape the future of energy, but how sustainably we allow it to do so. Follow me on LinkedIn . Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

What it means for consumers if Apple ditches China Warren Masilamony The West Australian Mon, 14 April 2025 3:50PM Comments Comments Camera Icon Xi Jinping has called out Donald Trump's tariff strategy, saying there are no winners in trade wars. Credit: AAP Share to Facebook Share to X Email Us Copy the Link US President Donald Trump has warned that the earlier announced exemptions on smartphones, computers and electronics are only temporary, whilst his administration works out a new sector-specific tariff, which will be in addition to the reciprocal tariffs on China. The levies are expected to force companies to bring production back to the US. The White House says President Donald Trump believes the U.S. has the workforce and resources to bring smartphone manufacturing \u2014 including the Apple iPhone \u2014 back to American soil. Although Apple iPhones are designed in the US, manufacturing has been outsourced to a company called Foxconn in China, since the launch of the original iPhone model in 2007. The Taiwanese electronics manufacturer has sprawling factories in China to assemble the popular device at scale and low cost. However, that could soon change, as the newly imposed 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports make it financially unfeasible for Apple to continue manufacturing in the Asian country. This is not the first time that a US president has raised the prospects of moving iPhone production back to American soil. Back in 2011, former US president Barack Obama famously asked the late Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on the possibility of an American-made iPhone, at a dinner function. \u201cThose jobs aren\u2019t coming back,\u201d the Apple founder replied decisively back then. But that didn\u2019t stop the rumblings amongst Americans on losing jobs to cheaper workers in third-world countries, where labour costs are much lower. Camera Icon A series of iPhone 16 on display inside a Apple Inc. store. Credit: Annice Lyn / Getty Images A Chinese factory worker assembling the original iPhone earned a basic monthly salary of just $US160 in 2007. This had somewhat improved to an hourly wage of about $US3.63 per hour by 2024, during the production of the latest iPhone 16. In comparison, a similar American worker earns at least $US4,000 a month, with skilled and unionized employees earning up to $US40 an hour, more than 10 times their Chinese counterparts. American employees also enjoy greater labour protection and occupational safety conditions. Chinese companies, on the other hand, have long been criticised for poor wages and unsafe working conditions. In the past, Foxconn had come under fire for installing \u201csafety nets\u201d at its factories to prevent staff committing suicide, due to gruelling work conditions. A UN report on China also raised concerns about widespread unsafe working conditions and inadequate mechanisms to address labour law and regulation violations. Apple had since diversified its iPhone production to India, Vietnam and Brazil to reduce its reliance on China. The South American country is now poised to become part of the main strategy to circumvent around the latest tariffs. But Brazil-made iPhones are still double the retail price than the Chinese versions, which retail at around $US790 in China. Even Indian-made iPhones retail higher at $US900 in India. A typical iPhone 16, now priced at $US1199 will sky-rocket to $US1500 or about $2400 Australian dollars \u2014 if produced entirely using American labour, according to Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan. Some analysts have warned that the retail price could further soar to $US3500 or more than $5000 Australian dollars, after factoring in costs of moving just 10 per cent of Apple\u2019s production facilities back to the US. An American-made iPhone also poses other challenges for Apple, like hiring enough skilled American workers and the company would still be subject to tariff costs for importing parts for the final assembly in the US. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research, said, \u201cIt\u2019s just not a reality that on the time frame of imposing tariffs that this is going to shift manufacturing here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pie in the sky,\u201d Mr Fieldhack said.

Read Today's Paper Apple reportedly manufactured iPhones worth $22 billion in India in just 12 months SECTIONS Apple reportedly manufactured iPhones worth $22 billion in India in just 12 months By Dhruv Mohan , ET Online Last Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 02:36:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Reportedly India now produces 20% of Apple\u2019s global iPhone output; Apple assembled $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in FY25. Local content in iPhones made in India has risen to 20% Apple\u2019s manufacturing momentum in India is picking up serious pace. According to a Bloomberg report by Mark Gurman, the company assembled iPhones worth a staggering $22 billion in the country in the 12-month period ending March 2025 \u2014 a sharp 60% increase from the previous fiscal year. That surge isn't just about scale \u2014 it signals a strategic shift. India now reportedly accounts for 20% of Apple\u2019s total iPhone production, or one in every five units made globally. For a company long reliant on Chinese assembly lines, that\u2019s a seismic move. India Rising in Apple's Supply Chain This dramatic uptick in output aligns with Apple\u2019s long-term ambition to reduce its manufacturing dependence on China \u2014 a move driven by both geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain vulnerabilities exposed during the pandemic years. India\u2019s IT and Electronics Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently confirmed the trend, stating that Apple exported \u20b91.5 trillion worth of iPhones from India in the same period. This reinforces India\u2019s growing role not just as a production hub, but as a key export engine for Apple\u2019s global operations. The Manufacturing Backbone The heart of Apple\u2019s production push in India lies in three main facilities. Foxconn\u2019s mega plant in Tamil Nadu leads the charge and remains the company\u2019s largest manufacturing site in the country. Two additional plants \u2014 one more in Tamil Nadu and another in Karnataka \u2014 are now under the Tata Group\u2019s wing. Tata has taken over Wistron\u2019s local operations and is reportedly managing Pegatron\u2019s India business as well, bringing cohesion to Apple\u2019s multi-supplier network in the region. Together, these three facilities form the spine of Apple\u2019s India operations, meeting both domestic demand and growing overseas shipments \u2014 especially to the U.S. U.S. Tariffs and the India Advantage Earlier this year, iPhone exports from India to the U.S. saw a noticeable jump \u2014 a response, in part, to President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement in February of a proposal for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on imports. Although smartphones and laptops were later exempted, the proposal triggered a ripple effect across global supply chains. The broader tariff regime \u2014 including a 20% levy on Chinese goods and a combined 145% tariff load \u2014 remains in effect. Trump has also warned that the electronics exemption could be temporary, with tariffs potentially returning in a matter of months. For Apple, this creates a time-sensitive incentive: iPhones made in India currently dodge those extra duties in the U.S., offering a significant cost advantage. That\u2019s accelerated the company\u2019s efforts to localize \u2014 not just in assembly but across its entire ecosystem. Suppliers Setting Up Shop As part of this deeper push, Apple has encouraged its global suppliers \u2014 including firms from China, Japan, and Taiwan \u2014 to establish a local presence in India. The results are already visible: companies like Sunwoda, Foxlink, and Aequs are now manufacturing components like battery packs, enclosures, and cables within the country. This localisation strategy is beginning to deliver. When Apple first joined India\u2019s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020, the local content in its devices was minimal \u2014 estimated at just 5\u20138%. Today, that figure has grown to about 20% for several models, a clear sign of progress toward a more self-sustaining Indian supply chain. A Brief History: From SE to Pro Apple\u2019s India manufacturing story started back in 2017 with the humble iPhone SE. That initial step has since evolved into a full-fledged production ecosystem that now includes models like the iPhone 12, 13, 14, 14 Plus, and 15. But for years, Apple kept its top-tier Pro models off the Indian production line \u2014 until late 2024. That\u2019s when the company made a historic move by assembling the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max in India for the first time. This marked a turning point. Until recently, India was mainly responsible for older or standard models. But by 2023, the iPhone 15 was not only being assembled locally but was also available on launch day \u2014 a milestone that signaled India\u2019s growing role in Apple\u2019s global rollout plans. Pegatron, one of Apple\u2019s major suppliers, also joined in to assemble the iPhone 15 Plus. More Than Just Manufacturing Apple\u2019s growing confidence in the Indian market isn\u2019t limited to assembly lines. In 2023, the company opened its first two exclusive Apple Stores \u2014 one in Mumbai and another in Delhi \u2014 offering Indian consumers the full Apple retail experience for the first time. Together with its manufacturing and export gains, this retail expansion paints a clear picture: India is no longer just a backup option in Apple\u2019s global strategy \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a central pillar.

Liam 'Akiba' Wright / @akibablade / Apr. 14, 2025 at 10:01 am UTC Bitcoin held near the $84,500 level on Monday following a weekend of muted price movement, while traditional markets reflected diverging investor sentiment in the wake of the latest moves in US-China trade tensions. The White House initially announced Friday that smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics would be exempt from steep tariffs. The US Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of excluded tariff codes, which would have benefited tech companies like Apple and Nvidia. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later indicated these electronics would soon face separate levies that would not be tied to specific countries. Trump himself contradicted the exemptions in a social media post, stating that \u201cno exceptions\u201d would be made for these products in a Sunday night Truth Social post, saying, \u201cNOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China[\u2026] We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d Several analysts depicted a narrative over the weekend that may be relevant to Trump\u2019s Sunday post, which posits a desire to appear strong in the face of global pressure, \u2013 Trump hikes China tariffs to 30% \u2013 China does nothing \u2013 Trump hikes China tariffs to 84% \u2013 China responds with matching tariffs \u2013 Trump hikes China tariffs to 145% \u2013 China responds with matching tariffs \u2013 Trump says that he wants Xi to call him \u2013 China does nothing \u2013 Trump says he is ready to \u201cmake a deal\u201d \u2013 China does nothing \u2013 Trump rolls back tariffs [on electronics] Trump made it clear that \u201cThere was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday.\u201d However, US Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on Friday indicating the opposite . Bitcoin is trading in a tight consolidation range, even as US equity futures pushed higher. S&P 500 June futures (ESM2025) climbed above 5,460, projecting a short-term target path toward 5,500, up 3.5%. Weekend price movements (Source: TradingView) This bullish equity momentum coincided with a 3.33% uptick in oil prices as traders reassessed energy demand forces amid policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Despite this, the US 10-year bonds and its Chinese counterpart moved modestly, ticking up 0.20%, indicating limited bond market reaction to weekend developments. Gold, which has acted as a defensive hedge during the trade war, declined by 0.11%. The price action suggests that investor appetite for risk assets remains intact, possibly driven by interpretations of the trade standoff as nearing saturation after China announced that it would no longer escalate tariffs. The muted bond and gold response also signal that China\u2019s retaliatory measures and US tariff ambiguity around electronics exemptions did not materially alter inflation and recession fears. Bitcoin\u2019s relative stability suggests that digital assets are decoupling, at least temporarily, from trade-sensitive macro instruments. Yet despite geopolitical volatility, its behavior alongside oil and equities points to lingering demand for risk-on assets. When US markets officially open later today, there will be a clearer picture of how the weekend\u2019s developments will impact major assets like Bitcoin, gold, oil, US equities, and bonds.

CEO David Zaslav Is the Last Hollywood Mogul Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission. Illustration: Cold War Steve; Photos: Getty Images, Courtesy Everett Collection, Warner Bros. This article was featured in One Great Story , New York \u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. David Zaslav is a member of a regular Zoom call that includes Howard Stringer , 83, who once ran Sony; Tom Freston , 79, who once ran Viacom; Walter Isaacson , 72, who once ran CNN and Time magazine; Graydon Carter , 75, who once ran Vanity Fair ; Richard Cohen , 84, retired from his longtime column at the Washington Post ; Nick Pileggi, 92, the GoodFellas screenwriter; Ken Auletta, 83, the Boswell to a former generation of media moguls; and Kenny Lerer, 73, the financial backer and co-founder of HuffPost , now retired from his investment business. At 65, Zaslav, currently the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, is the youngest person on the call. The group has met in some form and with a shifting cast for many years. At Zaslav\u2019s suggestion, it solidified into quite a defined club and a regular appointment during COVID \u2014 10 a.m. every Friday. Health issues form a subtext here, though, given that these are all men of a certain age and sensibility; the full details of, for instance, their trips to the Mayo Clinic might not be directly addressed. It is a social gathering, a \u201cshooting the shit\u201d opportunity in one member\u2019s more or less humblebrag, a kibitzing among men who have known the same people and shared much the same professional dramas over decades. But the impossible-to-ignore friction in the group is that while few members, if any, in the characterization of one of them, \u201cget up in the morning anymore and go to the office\u201d or indeed have formal jobs of any sort, David Zaslav , whose ear they have, holds a significant share of the remaining power of the once all-powerful media business \u2014 their business. He is in a sense the last member of this generation to have his hand firmly on the wheel (74-year-old Bob Iger, at Disney, is always on the cusp of retirement) and, for the others in the group, their last brush with the era of the mogul, such as it remains \u2014 the age in which they grew up. \u201cDavid is the CEO,\u201d says one member of the group, many members of which themselves were not too long ago CEOs. \u201cHe just acts like a CEO. He talks like a CEO. He asks the questions. He moves the discussion along.\u201d Members demur about how much they might influence Zaslav, but all of these men have singularly focused for their entire professional lives on many of Zas\u2019s daily issues and certainly believe they have achieved some sagaciousness. Kenny Lerer bought Martha Stewart\u2019s house in East Hampton so he could be across the street from his friend Zas, who had bought adman Jerry Della Femina\u2019s house; Zas and Kenny, who was once Michael Milken\u2019s PR man and, ex officio, advises his friend Zas on PR as well as other matters, speak to or see each other three or more times a week. Graydon Carter, showing his friend the social ropes shortly after Zas\u2019s takeover of Warner, convinced him to co-sponsor, along with Carter\u2019s newsletter, Airmail, and pay for the bulk of an over-the-top party in 2023 during the Cannes Film Festival at the Hotel du Cap, with, as it happened, unfortunate PR fallout for Zas (somewhat like, given the state of the industry, fiddling while Rome burned). Nick Pileggi\u2019s new movie, The Alto Knights, after being turned down at other studios, was made, at Zas\u2019s behest, at Warner Bros. Zaslav, whose company recently posted unexpectedly strong earnings (followed almost immediately by the personal embarrassment of dire numbers for the Pileggi film), is a man charged with leading the media business into the future, navigating the business out of its cultural, generational, and technological obsolescence. It is a business, said Andy Lack , a close Zas friend and the former head of NBC News , that \u201cwe won\u2019t recognize in five years\u201d and that, more immediately, faces the wrath and retribution of Donald Trump for its news division\u2019s slights against him \u2014 in WBD\u2019s case, CNN. And yet, as the world turns, here is David Zaslav regularly convening a brain trust of white men, all of them New York liberals, with an average age of 80. Their Zoom call as a metaphor for being stuck in time \u2014 another time \u2014 is, in the view of the group, an inevitable, if churlish, interpretation. Yet couldn\u2019t it also be seen (if it needs to be seen in any way), some of them wonder, as a reminder of the values and sensibility that have for so long shaped the business \u2014 as an anchor, in fast-shifting waters, for Zaslav? Couldn\u2019t it? In 2023, David Zaslav co-hosted a bash at the Cannes Film Festival that, in the words of a friend, became an \u201cunforced error.\u201d Photo: Daniel Paik The gradual decline of the media business has now arguably reached the all-at-once stage. Every aspect of the traditional distribution and revenue model is in some form, however extended, of extremis. The long sunset of network television and movie studios has more recently been joined with a new swiftness by cable television, whose 45 percent margins, supporting the industry for a generation, have now marched off a cliff. Against this background, in 2020 when he was merely the head of Discovery with some of the highest profit margins in the cable industry \u2014 but with cable\u2019s primacy already clearly over \u2014 Zaslav, whom his friend Lack characterized as \u201cnot sentimental but a bit of a romantic,\u201d bought the Hollywood home of Robert Evans, the legendary Paramount chief who oversaw the making of The Godfather, Chinatown, and Love Story. (Hollywood nostalgist and Zoom participant Graydon Carter, who helped immortalize Evans in his documentary The Kid Stays in the Picture and has just published a memoir, When the Going Was Good, a paean to the media past, was a key broker in the purchase.) It was a hard-to-miss reach for the symbols and tropes of Old Hollywood status, for which Zaslav was duly skewered (he bought the home, he tells me, for its \u201carchitectural value\u201d). A year later, Zaslav announced that Discovery, his much smaller company, was taking over WarnerMedia, the former Time Warner \u2014 long the dominant company in the media business (which AT&T, in some dumbfounding effort, had bought and then, at a loss to manage it, almost immediately regretted buying). The deal \u2014 appearing to be a case of the dog catching the bus \u2014 put Zaslav under a dark cloud of debt. But it gave him the Warner Bros. name, which he promptly restored, rebranding his company as Warner Bros. Discovery, and put him in Jack Warner\u2019s office (and, not incidentally, Kevin Tsujihara\u2019s office, Barry Myers\u2019s office, Bob Daly\u2019s office, and Ted Ashley\u2019s office \u2014 quite a lineup of Hollywood history) and behind Jack Warner\u2019s desk, which Zaslav hauled out of storage. Members of the Zoom call who find themselves in L.A. get a special tour of the Warner lot and glimpses into the bedrooms and back stairway where the Brothers Warner could nap during the day or do what moguls once did to the willing and unwilling (likely, too, across the selfsame desk). There is hardly a more dismal characterization than \u201clegacy media.\u201d Few ambitious types want to admit to being in it, and some of the biggest modern fortunes have been made upending it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the CEO of Time Warner who engineered a top-of-the-market deal to sell his company to AT&T in 2018, is held in awe by his shareholders for getting out in time. Eight months later, seeing the writing on the wall, Rupert Murdoch followed suit, selling the bulk of his company to Disney. Recently, Comcast announced a plan to spinoff most of its cable-television properties into a new company temporarily called \u201cSpinCo.\u201d but more colloquially, and perhaps accurately within the industry, \u201cShitCo.\u201d Still, legacy media is exactly what David Zaslav is doubling down on. For better or worse, his is a theory of the case: The media business has consistently weathered transition after transition, and there is always a survivor, so why can\u2019t he be the last man standing? Technology comes and goes while entertainment and sports are forever. Aren\u2019t they? Zas rises on a predawn schedule, to which he credits no small amount of his success (he says he built his relationship with Si and Donald Newhouse, major Discovery shareholders, because they too got up early), and, most days, after shooting off articles he reads in the New York Times or The Wall Street Journal to his staff and friends, starts out for his office at 6:30 or 7 a.m. While walking from his home on Central Park West (Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s former apartment, which Zaslav bought for $25 million), where he lives with his wife of 37 years, Pam, whom he met at synagogue at the age of 12 (they have three grown children \u2014 and Zas\u2019s mother is still alive), he\u2019ll make rat-a-tat checking-in phone calls, an hour and a half of walking and talking, down to his office on 19th Street. He is likely to speak to a variety of WBD executives, \u201cgetting the plays for the day, how do we move the ball,\u201d but also regularly to Kenny Lerer, David Geffen (whose house, like Lerer\u2019s, is down the street from Zaslav\u2019s in East Hampton), and former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein as well as the most significant investor in WBD, John Malone (speaking \u201coften not about business, just what\u2019s going on in the world\u201d). He talks too with other machers and gossips he happily lists, including Tom Freston; Allen Grubman, the entertainment lawyer and fixer (also an East Hampton neighbor); Bobby Kotick, the video-game billionaire; Brian Grazer, the billionaire film producer; Jason Blum, the horror-film impresario (and a hopeful one-day billionaire); Len Blavatnik, the Russian oligarch turned international businessman with extensive music and entertainment interests; and Richard Plepler, the former HBO chief (Zas did not, in our conversation, have any women on his call sheet). The media business may be among the last that still burns the phones, its true players dialing as fast as kids text. Indeed, at the top, it\u2019s still a business of talkers \u2014 hardly anybody ever opens a computer. They just talk, have always just talked. It\u2019s a constant conversation, a perpetual Barney Greengrass breakfast, part of a work-life continuum rather than the more au courant work-life balance (indeed, ever piercing the bubble of subordinates\u2019 weekends). The best talker, or at least the most indefatigable, wins. Arguably, this existential struggle is not just to preserve the industry\u2019s profits but the tribal rituals of men (with few exceptions men) who have grown up in it. That might seem, for all the obvious reasons, to raise contemptuous eyebrows. But also, for better or worse, what is being preserved, in the view of many people in the highest show-business strata, is the nature, the very DNA, of entertainment, at least as we have known it. It would not be, among these men, such a great leap to see the fate of the media business as a cultural showdown between the younger, self-serious, wildly overconfident, flatly literal, bad-taste Midwest tech bros in their bid for the attention of the American (or world) audience and the old Jewish guys of New York and L.A. who have for so long in their striving and jokes and neuroses, dominated the business \u2014 that\u2019s entertainment. You could as well see Zaslav and his old-guy circle as a bulwark against all the too-liberal (arguably unprofitable) efforts of an angry younger-demo media hoi polloi to culturally transform the business (Zas is particularly proud of his early decision at Warner to cancel the release of the $90 million Batgirl, which featured a trans actor). Also, you can see Zaslav\u2019s rise in the business as part of an indefatigable courtship of his media betters and forebears. It is no small point that, within this circle \u2014 this deeply tribal community of show-business men, rich ones \u2014 Zas is regarded with great, one-of-us affection. Of course, Zas \u2014 call it the Zas contradiction \u2014 is not really a show-business guy. He\u2019s a numbers guy. Less Robert Evans than Robert Evans\u2019s accountant (still, though, a show-business accountant, \u201cNot artist friendly but artist aware and adjacent,\u201d in one producer\u2019s description). He may hold in awe the true figures of the media and show-business world, but he would fire them and cut their projects in a New York minute. This has created, in the first year or two of his moguldom, a rearguard action of resentment and resistance within the industry \u2014 hence a largely unfriendly narrative (drowned out by chants of \u201cPay your writers\u201d in a speech he made during the writers strike; hoisted for a critical article in GQ that suspiciously disappeared just as the GQ editor was developing a movie at Warner Bros.; ridiculed for his party at Cannes, where a phalanx of aides and security people rushed out to light the way after Zaslav took a small red-carpet stumble on the Hotel du Cap steps \u2014 \u201cunforced errors,\u201d in the words of one Zoom-call member). Certainly, the takeover of Warner shone the media\u2019s own unremitting light on him and on the projects and personnel he has cut to pay down the company\u2019s whopping debt while taking for himself a whopping paycheck, indeed one of the biggest in the media industry \u2014 $52 million in 2024, $50 million in 2023, $40 million in 2022, all on top of a windfall of stock options in 2021 (around $200 million) prior to the Warner deal closing, amounts, in the face of the company\u2019s declining value, even his friends seem embarrassed by. Per one producer, \u201cHe is an avatar of the death of the middle class in Hollywood. In the old days, everybody did well. Now, all those people in the middle have been squeezed. Zas, though, is doing better than ever.\u201d Beyond mogul economics, the criticism has a quotient of snobbery: The Brooklyn-born, state-university-educated Zaslav, a \u201cvery un-Tiffany kind of person\u201d per a Tiffany-type producer, is a media upstart and wannabe who is fucking with, and fucking up, HBO, the new Tiffany Network. Zas, reaching for the mogul mantle, is certainly no Rupert Murdoch, nor is he the wry, ironic, brainy Bewkes or a Bob Evans\u2013type showman and golden-gut hitmaker. Zas can seem more like a sales manager who has memorized the PowerPoint deck (\u201cWe are on offense \u2026 We got a leadership team that is on mission \u2026\u201d). He is famous for his wide-of-the-mark efforts to dress for the mogul part, wearing, when I visited him recently in his suburban-looking office on 19th Street, a blue blazer over a hoodie over a T-shirt. His performance at the company\u2019s virtual town hall after the L.A. fires, a video of which his comms team offered me, was more halting and unsure than the man who had it under control, and whom Hollywood could gratefully turn to, who he likely wanted to appear to be. \u201cHe\u2019s a very effective manager and strategist in these businesses,\u201d said Blankfein about the hodgepodge of cable, movie, and streaming plays that uncomfortably compose modern media (\u201cwhich, by the way, are terrible businesses,\u201d Blankfein added). Zaslav\u2019s comms team has put Blankfein on the phone with me to push back against what Zas seems to feel may be my suggestion that he is less than a true mogul. \u201cBut does that mean he should walk among the giants of Hollywood? It wouldn\u2019t occur to me to put him there,\u201d Blankfein said, meaning, I infer, that moguldom may not be the most relevant skill set for this moment in media time. One member of the Zaslav Zoom call, professing personal affection for Zas, also expressed surprise that \u201ca guy like Zas\u201d had become among the most important people in the media business, by which he seemed to impute (putting aside the paycheck) an uncharacteristic normalcy for a mogul, a lasting middle-classness. Or, as another longtime observer put it, \u201cDavid has made a career out of being underestimated.\u201d Zaslav\u2019s early career, along with being an immersion course in the dense legal, logistical, technical, and personality tapestry of the nascent cable industry, was deep training in the art of dealing with the big man \u2014 which he surely hopes to be but is not quite yet. In 1986, Zaslav left his job as a junior associate at a large New York law firm and joined the counsel\u2019s office at NBC, then owned by GE and wholly dominated by Jack Welch, the GE CEO who, with only minor exaggeration, was largely regarded as among the best businessmen who had ever walked the earth (similarly, he is now regarded, with only minor exaggeration, as among the worst). Welch created a generation of media executives in the GE \u2014 that is, in his own personal \u2014 mode. \u201cAfter years spent working with Welch and presenting to him \u2026 you start to think like him,\u201d Zas says proudly. Zaslav was hardly unique among executives at NBC in embracing the Jack Welch way, but he seemed to have a special taste for it, requiring quite a leap for a Jewish boy into GE\u2019s macho, tight-lipped, towel-snapping, Catholic-boy culture. Zas became a favorite of both Welch (\u201cone of my very best friends\u201d) and Welch\u2019s top lieutenant, Bob Wright, with frequent references to both men continuing to pepper his conversations and, as almost a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 bullet, the reminder that he was a pallbearer at Welch\u2019s funeral. At John Malone\u2019s invitation, Zaslav left NBC in 2006. Holding NBC\u2019s major-cable portfolio, Zaslav had had many dealings over the years with Malone, an early cable-system mogul. While making vast profits off the business, Malone has not shown any discernible interest in media influence, power, glamour, stars, or stories. He is an engineer by training, quite a cerebral one \u2014 media is for him an engineering, rather than an operating, problem, a strategy of spinoffs, debt, and more or less opaque financial arrangements \u2014 with a trader\u2019s keen sensitivity to when markets are moving, telephony to cable to broadband. In 2005, when Malone\u2019s Liberty Media spun out Discovery into an independent company, though one still controlled by Malone, Zaslav, with his long relationship with Malone, became his choice for CEO. Meaning that Zaslav, even with the vast sprawl of his mass-entertainment products, principally has an audience of one: The 84-year-old Malone, who has just announced his retirement as WBD chairman but remains the most significant shareholder, is perhaps the last person in the media business who people still assume knows what he is doing. Which gives Zaslav quite a runway \u2014 Zas must know what he is doing because John Malone knows what he\u2019s doing, right? But while Malone famously gives great authority and autonomy and an open checkbook to his closest prot\u00e9g\u00e9-lieutenants, he is also like a greater force of nature: If tectonic plates shift in Malone\u2019s crustal sensitivity, billions of dollars in media assets could, overnight, be reordered. In that sense, Zaslav is trying to outrun not only his competitors but John Malone\u2019s timeline (a shifting one). Indeed, the 2022 deal to buy Warner might well have been due as much to Malone\u2019s desire to sell Discovery \u2014 but finding no buyer, he merged it into what was, in fact, a spinoff of Warner by AT&T, whose shareholders retain a large interest. Management passed to the Discovery side, making Zaslav the CEO and, in some sense, the accidental mogul. The Warner Bros. television and film business once made $3 billion a year \u2014 last year, it made $1.7 billion. AT&T paid more than $100 billion for Time Warner. Three years later, when AT&T spun the company off to Discovery, its valuation was roughly 40 percent lower. Post-merger, WBD started trading at $25 a share \u2014 at a $60 billion value. Now, says Zas\u2019s friend (and one of his biggest individual shareholders \u2014 30 million, he says bullishly) David Geffen, who was also enlisted by WBD to offer me his Zas endorsement, it\u2019s at around $9 a share (and has gone as low as $7), even combined with Discovery. \u201cWhat a bargain!\u201d That\u2019s the bracing reality that both Malone and Zaslav wake up to every morning \u2014 a curse or an opportunity. The assets of the media business circa 2025 are, in effect, all for sale. Shortly after Comcast announced its ShitCo. spinoff of MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and the Golf Channel, along with its digital fancies Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow, and SportsEngine, WBD followed suit with a reorganization plan of its own, separating its streaming (HBO, Max, and Discovery+) and content-creating (studio and library) businesses from its \u201cglobal linear networks\u201d \u2014 including TNT, TBS, the Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Animal Planet, and CNN, it\u2019s \u201cShitCo.\u201d In other words, escape is on everybody\u2019s mind. And getting out at the highest price may be, given all, the most reasonable move for John Malone. Zas, in the mission of his life, is determined not to let that happen. The Zaslav play \u2014 now, finally, after three years, out of the box and front and center in the company\u2019s messaging \u2014 is a simple and, to some extent, clear Johnny-come-lately one: Take HBO, the Time Warner gold-standard entertainment asset, and infuse it with a miscellany of other broad-appeal content (that is, basic-cable stuff, or \u201ctonnage\u201d in programming talk), and, risking extreme brand confusion, create an international streaming service called Max that might go head-to-head with Netflix. Or even take on network television: The Pitt, a medical drama with the old ER star Noah Wyle, is a 15-episode series with another season just commissioned for next year (no precious, streaming-style few episodes every few years). \u201cThe best storytelling content on a global platform,\u201d Zas pronounces as his strategy. In any conversation with Zaslav, he uses the words storytelling and storyteller \u2014 the media is the \u201cstorytelling business\u201d \u2014 to an all-purpose excess that is surely confusing to actual storytellers. What is meant here, it seems, in a psychic sense, is a connection to the long history of Hollywood and a way to emphasize, which WBD execs do, \u201cWe are not in the widgets business\u201d \u2014 a dig at the tech people (though widgets are the opposite of digits). But also meant is the dollars-and-cents value of the libraries the media business owns and the future, even perpetual, exploitability of that IP. And further, in the blanket use of storytelling as a virtue and an idiom, is the new fungibility of media, neither wedded to theaters, particular screens, or any defined form. We are not in the movie business, we are not in the television business, we are certainly not in the publishing business (Time Warner jettisoned its magazine company \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 in 2014). It\u2019s analog, it\u2019s digital, it\u2019s news, it\u2019s docudrama, it\u2019s fantasy, it\u2019s games, it\u2019s a podcast, it\u2019s a series. That is, content \u2014 that mulch of video, audio, digital, and written culture \u2014 with storytelling the newer, softer word. And we \u2014 WBD \u2014 are the biggest producers of it. And the best at it (four Apple TV+ hits are produced by Warner Bros. \u2014 Bad Monkey, Shrinking, Ted Lasso, and Presumed Innocent \u2014 notes Zaslav, making the point that the tech community lacks serious creative chops). \u201cAnd in the end, that\u2019s what wins, the best content.\u201d But best in media-business language does not necessarily mean best in a creative sense \u2014 rather, it is closer to most, and all things to all people , and hits . \u201cWe have the greatest writers and storytellers \u2014 Chuck Lorre, J. J. Abrams, Bill Lawrence, Mindy Kaling \u2014 we have 80 of those people,\u201d says Zaslav, as though to add them like weapons to his soldiers on the field. This is the up-to-the-minute media dream to supply content anywhere, anytime, on any device. That\u2019s the central Zaslav proposition, to make Max a must-have worldwide streamer and with him \u2014 deeply committed to the lore and thrall of the media business but at the same time a hard-hearted bottom-line executive \u2014 the man to do it. This has so far involved, \u201con our Max journey,\u201d as J. B. Perrette, WBD\u2019s streaming chief who has worked with Zas for 25 years, calls it, a two-year platform build-out \u2014 which can also be read as being waylaid and stalled for two years \u2014 an international dealmaking spree, and a deep investment in big new franchises. It has also involved an industry sense that this has come at the expense of HBO, a downgrade in its stature and resources. (\u201cThey entirely misunderstood the HBO brand,\u201d says one former studio executive. \u201cThey thought it stood for linear-subscription TV while it stood for the highest quality of television available.\u201d) Zaslav seems pained by this but resigned: This is the breaking-eggs phase. And by the way, even if HBO and its vast success and sui generis place in modern entertainment may be part of the linear-television past, in fact, \u201cHBO has never been bigger or more successful,\u201d says Zas. Its longtime management team is still largely in place, and the company vigorously argues for HBO\u2019s continued quality: The Penguin , Hacks , The Last of Us (which was the biggest HBO series since the last season of Game of Thrones ), Succession , and, indeed, The White Lotus , which might reasonably claim to be the moment\u2019s true Zeitgeist hit \u2014 its recent finale was 50 percent bigger than the season before. But at the same time, while HBO might yet be the gold standard, in its mixed messaging, Max (an incomprehensible elevation of the company\u2019s also-ran\u2013never-was Cinemax brand) is the future-looking (and Hail Mary) reboot. On this, the company\u2019s position is wholly bullish: In the past six months, Zaslav says, Max has added 20 million subscribers (it\u2019s actually 19 million) \u2014 \u201cgrowing, accelerating, and profitable and will generate more profit every quarter,\u201d Zaslav emphatically makes the point \u2014 bringing it to a worldwide 117 million yet being in only half of the markets that Netflix, with its 300 million subscribers, is in. Max is growing at a rate that, if sustained (a big if), as it reaches 100 percent penetration will overtake Netflix. And this is before a series of big new franchise investments has come online. The recent announcement of its quarterly results showed nearly $700 million in profits from streaming and direct to consumer. The company\u2019s estimate of $1 billion in 2025 was raised to $1.3 billion. Management has been feverishly circulating a column in Puck \u2014 often a gossipy thorn in Zaslav\u2019s side \u2014 by William Cohan arguing the company has turned the corner by paying down debt and increasing its streaming cash flow. Cohan, echoing the WBD message, extolled the Zaslav strategy of \u201cinternationalizing\u201d Max. And, indeed, it is a certain leap out in front of the loud chorus of the past few years that predicted nothing but a doom spiral. The ceiling, though, may already be fixed. Max\u2019s best hope, if all its dreams come true, may be only to become the sixth streaming service, behind Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, and YouTube. That is better than all the other also-ran streamers but not necessarily good enough to stand alone. It\u2019s in danger, in other words, of becoming no more than another piece on the board, waiting for future media asset builders to determine its future. Even a truly over-the-top success for Max might not do it. The streaming business, which great tech companies can afford to support, at its best produces 20 percent margins, which hardly replace cable\u2019s 45 percent margins that media investors \u2014 like John Malone \u2014 have come to expect. How do you support streaming while keeping investors happy? Can streaming, even with increased subscribers, higher prices, and international reach, ever perform at the level of the old network mass-reach and mass-advertising model or the cable bundle, dual subscriber, and ad-rev stream? Indeed, how do you hold investors\u2019 belief in the very idea of a media company? Well, there is no answer. There is no model \u2014 with the possible exception of Disney with, uniquely, its theme parks; its Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm franchises; and dominance in the family market \u2014 of a media company that can, at this point in delivery-system time, promise sustainable growth. David Zaslav may be looking forward to a streaming afterlife and a place at the table among the streaming giants, but he is still, alas, and even principally, in the ShitCo. cable business. And yet \u2026 the trick of the ever\u2013transitioning media business has always been to manage decline while you pray for better days. Technology companies only exist as of today; the media business is a tension between past, present, and future. The past doesn\u2019t ever go away, television didn\u2019t wipe out radio, cable didn\u2019t wipe out network, streaming won\u2019t wipe out terrestrial \u2014 you just have to be fast enough and ruthless enough to adjust your management of it. While Zaslav may from a certain angle look like a parody of a wannabe media mogul, and not necessarily a very good parody, there is at the same time a view that Zaslav, fairly rare among the mogul set, possesses a level of business self-awareness, an understanding that, together with his mogul dreams, his day job is being a real nuts-and-bolts guy on a tight timetable. His circle, even without prodding, notes his prodigious work ethic \u2014 \u201cpragmatic, straightforward, straight shooting,\u201d says Zas\u2019s friend Bobby Kotick, the gaming billionaire, delegated to offer an encomium \u2014 while brushing past his episodes of ostentation and glamour grabs. \u201cHe really is not an asshole,\u201d defends another friend. As Zaslav works his present streaming strategy, seeking to talk about nothing else but, he is, too, less publicly, deeply attentive to the cable past. For one thing, cable\u2019s profits, while bleak in the future, are still strong in the present, and Zaslav\u2019s astute management of them has, in a surprise to the industry, helped bring down what seemed to be WBD\u2019s unsustainable debt to quite reasonable levels. What\u2019s more, ShitCo. may now present quite an opportunity. The FCC has had under Obama and Biden an antagonistic view of media mergers. The Trump age opens the possibility of creating a big industry utility of shit \u2014 a massive combination of cable properties to maximize efficiencies, margins, and leverage with cable providers. It may obviously seem to be a competitive disadvantage that, while the technology business builds the future, the media business is more often than not surprised by it. Yet that, in a way, is the nature of media \u2014 of the Zeitgeist, of a hit, and of show business. If you can\u2019t roll with it, you shouldn\u2019t be on the boat (\u201cGetting to the other side of the river\u201d is how a weary-sounding Casey Bloys, the 20-year HBO veteran, now CEO, puts it). The future, in the traditional media model, always holds unknown fortune, whether that be the conversion to DVDs that supported a generation or the wild margins in the cable bundle or \u2026 WBD\u2019s Harry Potter series, which the company is massively investing in and is billing as the biggest launch in streaming history. Or its other big number, Superman (the first of a dozen superheroish movies slated over the next ten years to try to turn Warner\u2019s ownership of DC Comics into something like Disney\u2019s gift-that-keeps-giving Marvel and make the studio, just like Disney, a repeat franchise machine). Zaslav is putting a lot of hope in Harry Potter and Superman \u2014 oh, and Cat in the Hat as a central piece of its kids\u2019 build-out \u2014 as both part of the branding makeover for Max (not your father\u2019s HBO) and wishes for an endless franchise future. Hits, at least temporarily, solve all problems. This may seem like a slim reed, but in the past, it has always worked for somebody. Why not Zas? And it\u2019s not as though anyone else has a better plan. Media mogul is not necessarily a job too many people want anymore and not necessarily a job that truly exists (even if the paychecks still do). It\u2019s a cautious industry now and a stripped-down one. What is a media mogul compared with Musk, Zuckerberg, or Bezos? (In the case of David Ellison, who is buying Paramount Global with his father Larry Ellison\u2019s multi-hundred-billion-dollar fortune, what is a media mogul compared with the coddled child of a tech titan?) But Zaslav wants the job, arguably may appear to want it too much, and believes in it, which, given how many people seem to want nothing to do with it, is quite a significant stake in the ground. In our conversation in his New York office \u2014 leather couch, re-created exposed-brick walls, and pictures of the Beatles and Hendrix \u2014 Zas is vastly more earnest than flashy, concentrating hard on the details of how he\u2019s going to lead his business over its complicated hurdles. This may seem like his more natural place: David Zaslav, the office guy. He works earnestly, if somewhat less convincingly, at trying to be the other thing, too \u2014 power broker, nabob, kahuna. But he is still the office guy who, miraculously, found himself sitting in the seat, and can\u2019t believe it, and certainly doesn\u2019t want to get out of it \u2014 its existential condition be damned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be doing this stuff if I were him, but guess what, he loves it!\u201d says his friend Blankfein. Moguldom, even if Zas is an unlikely mogul, is what he\u2019s trying to preserve and restore. And he is playing the part \u2014 or learning it. (In the new Apple+ series The Studio, Seth Rogen says he modeled the studio overlord, a rapacious moron played by Bryan Cranston, on Zaslav.) Indeed, every studio, including Warner, had passed on Zoom-call member Nick Pileggi\u2019s script about Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, The Alto Knights. Pileggi is a beloved figure in the entertainment business by virtue of his contributions to the industry-staple organized-crime drama and mythmaking and his marriage to Nora Ephron. In today\u2019s fraught world, where any green-light demands consensus, Zaslav \u2014 in an example of old-school mogul behavior not seen in many years \u2014 proudly pushed the film into production. Peculiarly or meaningfully, the project has been in development since 1974. Irwin Winkler was the producer then with Michael Cimino signed on as director and James Toback as screenwriter \u2014 but then, in a footnote of ancient Hollywood history, it was put into turnaround when Alan Ladd Jr. took over the Twentieth Century Fox film division. Irwin Winkler, at 93, is still the film\u2019s producer, recruiting in his long, heroic effort to make the film for his 92-year-old writer, Pileggi; Barry Levinson, at 82, is the director; and Robert De Niro, at 81, is the star, playing both Costello and Genovese. Prior to the film\u2019s disastrous $3 million opening last month, the green-light decision was being touted by some in the industry as both Zaslav\u2019s boldness over committee caution and a return to the great age of Hollywood dramas. Now, in similar mogul fashion, blame is being spread around, with Zaslav disclaiming responsibility and with the expectation that heads, though not Zas\u2019s, will roll. Now The Alto Knight s just confirms the Zaslav strategy: Film drama is dead, and building franchises is film\u2019s future. A Minecraft Movie, in which Warner has a 75 percent interest (Legendary has 25 percent) opened in early April bigger than Barbie \u2014 the biggest movie of the year so far! This too is a key mogul skill: surviving flops. That\u2019s show business (said with a shrug). And who knows? Fifty years from now, someone may pull out the Zaslav desk. And a coda. What about \u2026 Trump? In the endless cascade of existential variables in the media business, now Trump! Even if you can will hits into being, and somehow hold together broken business models and achieve new global breakthroughs, now you have to deal with, at some very personal mogul level, Trump. While much of the tech world has decided to meet the Trump phenomenon with obsequiousness, and other media companies are making ignominious deals (at ABC, at CBS), and Comcast, doubtlessly, has a sense of relief that their ShitCo. spinoff includes the lefty MSNBC, David Zaslav remains, uncomfortably, the owner of CNN, Trump\u2019s longtime and consistently most hated media target. This is a confusing place for Zaslav to be because nothing about his career would indicate an interest in news. Nor, in the grand scheme, does CNN seem to be a particularly integral part of his vision for WBD (Zaslav insists it is). In one of his few direct expressions, John Malone has even opined about his distaste for the polarization of cable news, which, awkwardly, is cable news\u2019 bread and butter. One of Zaslav\u2019s earliest decisions in the takeover of Warner Media was not to support CNN chief Jeff Zucker, a Zaslav friend from the NBC days (Zucker was also a Jack Welch favorite). In the interregnum period during the deal with AT&T to take control of Warner, Zucker, accused of a corporate infraction for not reporting his relationship of many years\u2019 standing with a colleague, was ousted in apparent political payback by AT&T enemies. Zaslav\u2019s choice not to save the high-flying Zucker may reasonably be read as an effort to downgrade CNN\u2019s profile and importance. His subsequent appointment of Chris Licht, quite a lightweight, to take over one of the key spots in American news happened without a real search, and Licht\u2019s rule collapsed in about a year. Then Zaslav, again without much of a search, turned to Mark Thompson, the retired CEO of the New York Times, for his reputation as an adult in the room with keen corporate acumen who might be counted on to understand the nuances of the moment. But Zaslav is still stuck not only with a fast-declining business and what can seem like the day-by-day erosion of one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands and all the negative media attention that brings, but because of CNN, he now has Trump as a Damocles potentially threatening the entire WBD business. This is too against the background that Time Warner, in its modern history, has been one of the great liberal-bulwark companies, the true home of the New York and L.A. media elite. Trump might have noticed, or surely will, that one of Zas\u2019s key lieutenants is Robert Gibbs, Obama\u2019s former press secretary. What\u2019s more, everyone on Zaslav\u2019s Zoom call is a liberal Democrat, with a required part of their conversation, after their close reading of the New York Times and the Washington Post, about the daily depredations of Donald Trump. Zaslav, a card-carrying G5 liberal, has sought, as everyone in his circle has, Manhattan cred \u2014 among other things, that has previously included prodigious support for Democrats. And now, as he and John Malone look to trade their way out of the tight spots of the business, they may need Donald Trump. WBD confirmed that a company representative recently reached out to the Trump orbit seeking advice about how the company might advantageously interact with the White House and improve its Trump-age odor. The reported message was to look at the example of Amazon and Jeff Bezos paying Melania Trump $40 million to participate in a documentary about herself. Don Jr. might like a hunting and fishing show on the Discovery Channel, they were told. And that CNN could have more pro-Trump voices \u2014 suggestion provided. Zaslav, who was notably photographed at the U.S. Open in September with Elon Musk , does not, to say the least, seem like a man for a moment that may require a face-off with this president. Zaslav\u2019s neutral, largely meaningless comments about CNN \u2014 \u201cThe most important thing to me \u2026 the metric that is most important to me \u2026 is how trusted is a brand is CNN \u2026 We believe in journalism \u2026 Journalism is fighting for the best version of the truth, as Carl Bernstein would say,\u201d invoking Christiane Amanpour and the tanks rolling into Moscow in 1991 \u2014 may seem to indicate that he is rightly not looking forward to that moment\u2019s coming.

The solution lies in external devices that unlock advanced features such as YouTube, Netflix, and app access through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto\u2014all without requiring a jailbreak. These devices offer a seamless way to enhance your in-car entertainment system while preserving your vehicle\u2019s original functionality. The video below from HotshotTek explores how these devices work, their features, and why they are a practical choice for upgrading your driving experience. Watch this video on YouTube . Understanding External Devices for In-Car Entertainment External devices designed for in-car entertainment come in two primary categories, each offering unique benefits: Android-based devices: These devices provide full Android functionality, allowing access to apps like YouTube, Netflix, and the Google Play Store directly on your car\u2019s infotainment screen. They essentially transform your car\u2019s system into a smart device. Wireless CarPlay adapters: These adapters are designed to convert wired CarPlay systems into wireless ones. In addition to eliminating the need for cables, they often include features like streaming capabilities and enhanced audio performance. Both types of devices are compatible with vehicles that support wired CarPlay, making them an accessible and cost-effective solution for drivers looking to expand their car\u2019s multimedia capabilities without replacing the head unit. Features and Benefits of External Devices These devices bring a wealth of functionality to your car\u2019s infotainment system, transforming it into a versatile multimedia hub. Key features include: Streaming access: Enjoy popular platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Apple Music directly from your car\u2019s display. App downloads: With Google Play Store support, you can install additional apps to suit your preferences. Connectivity options: Many devices offer built-in LTE connectivity via a SIM card or mobile hotspot, making sure uninterrupted streaming on the go. Cross-platform compatibility: These devices work seamlessly with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay systems, catering to a wide range of users. Mobile gaming support: While console streaming isn\u2019t available, some devices allow for casual gaming, adding another layer of entertainment. Whether you\u2019re embarking on a long road trip or navigating your daily commute, these features can significantly enhance your driving experience by providing entertainment and convenience. Preserving Your OEM System One of the standout advantages of these external devices is their ability to retain your car\u2019s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) system. Unlike aftermarket head units, which can be costly and may disrupt your car\u2019s settings, these devices integrate seamlessly with your existing setup. By keeping the OEM system intact, you benefit from: Preserved car settings: Features like climate controls, ambient lighting, and other factory settings remain unaffected. High-quality displays and audio: OEM systems often offer superior resolution and sound quality compared to aftermarket alternatives. Full compatibility: These devices work harmoniously with your car\u2019s built-in features, making sure a smooth user experience. This makes them particularly appealing for older vehicles, where replacing the head unit might not be practical or cost-effective. By opting for an external device, you can enjoy modern entertainment features without compromising your car\u2019s original design. Considerations and Limitations While these devices offer numerous advantages, it\u2019s important to be aware of their limitations to make an informed decision: Vehicle compatibility: These devices are only compatible with cars that support wired CarPlay, limiting their use in some models. Variable audio quality: The sound performance may differ depending on the specific device you choose, so research is essential. Data usage: Streaming relies on cellular data, which could lead to increased costs if not monitored carefully. Despite these challenges, the benefits of these devices often outweigh the drawbacks, especially for drivers seeking a cost-effective way to upgrade their car\u2019s entertainment system. Who Benefits the Most? These devices are particularly advantageous for specific groups of drivers, including: Owners of older vehicles: Drivers with older models, such as those equipped with Ford Sync 3 or earlier Kia systems, can modernize their infotainment experience without replacing the head unit. Road trip enthusiasts: Long journeys become more enjoyable with access to streaming platforms and other entertainment options. Audio-focused users: Those who prioritize sound quality can benefit from devices designed to enhance audio performance. If you fall into any of these categories, these devices can provide a significant upgrade to your in-car experience, making every drive more enjoyable and engaging. The Future of In-Car Entertainment The landscape of in-car entertainment is evolving rapidly. There is growing speculation that Apple and Google may eventually integrate streaming platforms like YouTube directly into CarPlay and Android Auto. Some automakers, including BMW, Tesla, and Mercedes, have already introduced built-in YouTube functionality in their infotainment systems. However, until these features become standard across all vehicles, external devices remain the most practical and accessible option for enhancing your car\u2019s entertainment capabilities without altering its original design.

Photo Tiffany Sage, BFA.com/National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution In Amy Sherald \u2019s unique visual language, muted yet commanding Black subjects are set against bold color fields. These eye-catching portraits reward longer looking. Her subjects, donning carefully selected garments, face audiences directly with quiet dignity, their skin painted in shades of gray. Sherald\u2019s elegant compositions celebrate various American visual traditions, from fashion spreads and clothing advertisements to historical painting from John Singer Sargent\u2019s intimate society portraits and Grant Wood\u2019s distinctly American regionalism to Kehinde Wiley\u2019s contemporary reframing of historical portraiture, though hers are refracted through a lens that subtly questions these traditions even as it engages them. Related Articles Fondation Louis Vuitton Makes a Big Splash with David Hockney's Largest Exhibition Ever Karyn Olivier's Elusive Art Bears Witness to Hidden Histories Bringing together some 40 portraits across nearly two decades of her career, Sherald\u2019s current survey at Whitney Museum in New York (through August 10) invites us to see how the artist, who rose to international acclaim after painting Michelle Obama in 2018, has reimagined portraiture while posing deeper questions about identity and American mythology. These tensions\u2014between beauty and complexity\u2014remind us that reimagining national identity requires not just new images, but new ways of seeing. Visitors will likely recognize Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (2018), the 6-foot-tall painting in which the former First Lady appears monumental yet approachable in her geometric patterned dress against a soft blue backdrop. While the Michelle Smith\u2013designed dress has been compared to Piet Mondrian\u2019s spare, primary-color compositions, Sherald has said that in the bold, patchwork-like geometry she sees echoes of the visual language of the Gee\u2019s Bend quilters, the cohort of Black women from rural Alabama whose work merges abstraction, utility, and ancestral memory. This overlooked reference subtly re-centers Black vernacular creativity as a foundational influence, challenging dominant narratives in fashion and design while anchoring the painting within a deeper, more nuanced cultural zeitgeist. The painting\u2019s loan from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., speaks to its significance, while its placement\u2014on its own wall facing a bench for contemplation\u2014in Sherald\u2019s retrospective reinforces how it simultaneously builds on the artist\u2019s earlier work and points toward to her more recent direction. Amy Sherald, They Call Me Redbone, but I\u2019d Rather Be Strawberry Shortcake , 2009. Photo Ryan Stevenson/\u00a9Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth/National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C. The exhibition, which debuted at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art last November, is organized chronologically and includes early works like Hangman (2007) and Well Prepared and Maladjusted (2008), which illustrate Sherald\u2019s style as she was developing it. In these formative pieces, we see the artist experimenting with her now signature technique of grayscaling skin tones, though with more tentative color relationships and less refined compositional strategies. The latter work, for example, highlights her emerging interest in how clothing communicates identity. The female subject, wearing a pink gingham shirt, her hair styled in a neat updo, stands against a muddy blue background overlaid in parts with a spongey pink cheetah print that forecasts the more assertive color juxtapositions of Sherald\u2019s later works. In They Call Me Redbone, but I\u2019d Rather Be Strawberry Shortcake (2009), the artist\u2019s visual approach has fully formed. Here, Sherald\u2019s take on clothing, color, and posture as they relate to identity lies front and center in this portrait of a woman in a yellow dress, her hands in her pockets and her head tilted inquisitively. The title, like many Sherald chooses, adds complexity to the calm visual presentation. Strawberry Shortcake asserts her chosen name, amplified by a strawberry pattern on the bodice of her dress and the nearly solid strawberry pink background. She dares you to call her Redbone. The portraitist\u2019s more recent large-scale paintings, on the other hand, demonstrate how her take on size and composition have evolved. In A Midsummer Afternoon Dream (2020), a woman in a blue dress stands beside a white bicycle, gently occupying the space in front of a bright green lawn with a white picket fence; the scene deliberately recalls, and then revises, mid-century American domestic ideals. At 8.8 by 8.4 feet, the work translates portraiture into its own environment entirely, immersing the viewer in Sherald\u2019s vision of Black leisure and belonging in spaces historically coded as white. Amy Sherald, A Midsummer Afternoon Dream , 2021. Photo Joseph Hyde/\u00a9Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth/Private Collection That depiction of a mid-century Americana that now includes Black people is further evident in a work from a year later, As American as apple pie (2021). In this double portrait, a couple stand in front of a yellow house and vintage car, the woman wearing a pink skirt and matching \u201cBarbie\u201d T-shirt, and the man in sand-colored chinos, a white T-shirt, and a vibrant denim jacket. Sherald\u2019s growing interest in subverting American iconography not only questions the historical exclusion of Black Americans but also aims to normalize Black presence within the visual canon through a restrained aesthetic. Even the title\u2019s reference to that classic dessert amplifies the narrative, inserting Black subjects into the visual language of American identity. A God Blessed Land (Empire of Dirt ), from 2022, similarly expands this purview, showing a Black man on a green John Deere tractor against a clear sky. The painting reconfigures American farming imagery, placing Black presence in the mythic landscape of American agriculture, a realm from which Black Americans have been systematically pushed out. That he stands atop this piece of machinery, as if further proof of his victory over the land, adds to this narrative of reclamation against a history of enslavement and forced manual labor. The subject\u2019s confident pose and direct gaze make viewers reconsider who belongs in this quintessentially American scene. Amy Sherald, A God Blessed Land (Empire of Dirt) , 2022, installation view, at Whitney Museum, 2025. Photo Tiffany Sage, BFA.com/\u00a9Amy Sherald Smaller works, like 2020\u2019s A bucket full of treasures (Papa gave me sunshine to put in my pockets\u2026) , show a more intimate side of Sherald\u2019s practice. The portrait depicts a young man in a white shirt embroidered with a yellow sun and red lobster; the pale-yellow background hinting at innocence and affection. The title suggests personal memory and family connection, themes that run throughout the exhibition but feel especially moving in the artist\u2019s depictions of children and young adults, like in Innocent You, Innocent Me (2016) of a teen boy holding an ice cream cone and wearing a camo Marvel T-shirt. It\u2019s worth noting that the exhibition title, \u201cAmerican Sublime,\u201d intentionally places Sherald\u2019s work both within and against art historical tradition. Sherald offers a different vision of sublimity from the overwhelming natural phenomena that inspire awe or terror that we are used to. Rather than vast landscapes or dramatic scenes, her sublime comes through in the daily experiences of ordinary people, their gazes steady and self-assured\u2014set against backgrounds so uniform they risk quieting the very individuality her portraits aim to elevate. This points to a significant reimagining of a concept that, in Western art history, has rarely centered the Black experience. Amy Sherald, What\u2019s precious inside of him does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence (All American) , 2017. Photo Joseph Hyde/\u00a9Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth/Private Collection, Courtesy Monique Meloche Gallery While Sherald\u2019s painting skill and compositional strength are evident, her aesthetic choices also raise important questions. Her signature rendering of Black skin in gray tones, meant to transcend racial categorization, creates a beautiful but potentially problematic distance. In removing the specificity of skin tone, Sherald risks aestheticizing Blackness in ways that might accidentally sanitize the lived realities of racial experience. The cool, composed manner of her subjects, while dignified, sometimes feels detached in ways that might unintentionally reinforce rather than challenge the flattening of Black identity. To this end, although Sherald\u2019s use of American visual motifs questions dominant narratives of national identity, her consistently calm, controlled visual interpretation sometimes works against the complex, varied nature of the Black American experience. Though visually striking, the artist\u2019s stately style at times contradicts what her work otherwise suggests: that Blackness and Black people aren\u2019t monolithic. The similar emotional tone across her portraits\u2014consistent across age, gender, or setting\u2014offers stunning coherence but occasionally limits her subjects\u2019 expressive range. That said, these tensions don\u2019t diminish Sherald\u2019s contribution; overall, they reflect the built-in challenges of making work that functions as celebration, critique, and revision of American visual culture all at once. In Sherald\u2019s hands, the American sublime is not found in the vastness of nature or the spectacle of power, but a space where individual humanity becomes transcendent.

And that\u2019s a\u2014 [ Music .] Yasmin Tayag: A perfect age. Brennan: A perfect age. My friends keep doing this bit that no matter how old I turn, they keep saying a perfect age for a woman , so it was like 27, the perfect age for a woman , and then I turned 28, the perfect age. Now once again, somehow I\u2019ve turned the perfect age for a woman. But I always remember thinking like, 28, for some reason, really stood out to me as the time that I thought I, like, thought a lot of my life would be together. And now that I\u2019m past that age, it\u2019s so funny to me to think that I thought that everything would magically be figured out at that time. But I find myself now just being like, 34 . Tayag: [ Laughs .] Brennan: It\u2019s gonna work out for me by 34 . Which I know, then I\u2019m gonna turn 34 and laugh at that and be like, what I thought was 34 is actually 42. Tayag: Well, I\u2019m 37, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s funny\u2014when I was a kid, I thought 37, you know, like my parents, I would have it all together. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Brennan: We\u2019re still just us at every single age. It\u2019s just going to be me at every age. Tayag: Yeah, but there\u2019s something comforting in that. To think that like, Oh, nobody really has it together at any age! They\u2019re all\u2014everyone\u2019s just figuring it out as they go along . Tayag: I\u2019m Yasmin Tayag, a staff writer with The Atlantic. Brennan: And I\u2019m Natalie Brennan, producer at The Atlantic. Tayag: This is How to Age Up . [ Music .] Brennan: I\u2019m very aware of the fact that 20s, 30s aren\u2019t the typical zone that people think of when they think of aging. [ Laughs. ] But we are all always aging, right? Tayag: We\u2019re always aging. Brennan: And at different life stages, some of us are thinking about it more than others. Like there\u2019s this big cultural hype around turning 30, and you know, I\u2019m a girl who spends a lot of time on the internet. And let me just say: The internet is not usually a space that promotes positive ideas of aging for young women. Tayag: Really? Brennan: Yeah, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m reporting it live. But I mean, I\u2019m thinking about even last year, the fashion trends revolved around bows; everything leaned very coquette in aesthetic. That in some ways \u2026 does promote an infantilization of women. Tayag: I totally agree, but I do actually think there\u2019s been a recent shift happening in terms of how we think about aging. You know, I wasn\u2019t excited about my 30s when I was growing up. Everyone I admired in pop culture was in their early 20s, max. And now, we\u2019re seeing celebrities who rose to fame in their 20s become even more sexy and powerful as they turn 30 or 40 or 50, like Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Alexa Chung, even Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 they\u2019re just owning their age, and they\u2019re modeling that getting older can still be sexy and powerful. Brennan: Extremely. Tayag: When I turned 30, the big thing I noticed was that, like, Oh, I like myself more. I\u2019m more comfortable in my skin. [ Music .] Brennan: And I\u2019m really grateful that in my personal life, I have so many amazing models of, yeah, people in my life who are in their 30s. Who just, yeah, seem to be more confident and more sure of themselves. Tayag: I hope I\u2019m one of those people. Brennan: One thousand percent one of those people. Tayag : Natalie, you know, as I\u2019m approaching my 40s I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how I\u2019m about to enter a new stage of life. So I can help you through 20s and 30s\u2014but I\u2019m looking for someone to help me through my 40s, and my 50s, and beyond! Brennan: And does that feel exciting, or does it feel scary? Tayag: Well, I\u2019m hoping to go into it with a positive mindset! Especially the perimenopause of it all. And someone, for me, who has really reframed what getting older can look like is Dr. Karen Adams. Dr. Adams is an ob-gyn, and she\u2019s the director of the Stanford Program in Menopause & Healthy Aging. [ Music .] Tayag: Dr. Adams, tell me how you describe your profession to someone at a cocktail party. Karen Adams: Well, I used to say that I deliver babies, but I don\u2019t do that anymore. And actually people are much more interested when I tell them that I was recruited about two years ago to create and lead a program in menopause and healthy aging. And people\u2019s eyes light up. I mean, everyone wants to age in a healthy way. And of course, you\u2019d have to be living under a rock to not know that menopause is having not even a moment\u2014it\u2019s a movement. People are very interested in perimenopause and menopause. Before I went to Stanford, I was in charge of training all of the OB-GYN residents at Oregon Health and Science University. And one of the requirements for the training was that they get trained in care of what was called then older women . And they were coming out of training really well, well-versed in delivering babies and operating and contraception and all these different things, but they actually weren\u2019t learning how to take care of women over 40. And so I established this clinic that we called the \u201cOver-40 Clinic\u201d; I\u2019m doing air quotes now. Now we know menopause can happen really at almost any age, through premature ovarian failure or insufficiency or early menopause. So it isn\u2019t really age dependent. It\u2019s been 20\u201325 years ago that I established that clinic, and it just became more and more my clinical focus. Tayag: It\u2019s shocking to hear how little focus there was in medical schools on menopause. And, like, if there\u2019s a knowledge deficit in doctors , it must be even greater culturally, just with the general public. Adams: It\u2019s one of the huge issues right now. That people with ovaries\u2014not everyone identifies as a woman , but I\u2019ll use that term as we\u2019re talking, simply because that\u2019s what the terms are in the research and such have been used\u2014but right, you know, that women are becoming much more educated about this sometimes than their providers are. There was a lot of fear around being on hormones 20 years ago because this big study came out and said, Wow, it increases the risk of heart attack and stroke and blood clots and breast cancer and all these thing s. And people freaked out, and everybody went off their hormones\u2014and we\u2019re still working to undo those messages. And medical students, residents, people who were in training for about 15 years didn\u2019t get taught about hormones or menopause, so there is some catching up to do. Tayag: Okay, so I want to come back to the specifics of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study on hormone therapy. But first I\u2019m hoping to talk to you more about the misconceptions about menopause on the whole that you\u2019re hearing these days? Adams: Oh, probably most often that it is the end of something. And that people feel mournful about the process, and they feel like it means their best years are behind them. And the reality is, there is a thing called menopausal zest . And it is a real thing. And I\u2019m here to tell you that your mother and your grandmother are pretty much having a good time. It\u2019s the transition that\u2019s hard. You know, perimenopause is hard, because you\u2019re going through a lot of changes, and what is your normal is now different. And so that transition is challenging. But oh my goodness\u2014once you get through it, women rate that they are happier at their work, in their relationships, with their partners, in their overall well-being, their feeling of knowing who they are and being comfortable with that. You know, what\u2019s funny is: Do you know the decade of life when people are the most unhappy? What age would you think that would be? Tayag: Fifties? Adams: Twenties. Tayag: Wow. Adams: Twenties. Teens and 20s. And then people get happier in their 30s and kind of early 40s, and then there\u2019s kind of a little dip\u2014late 40s to mid-50s, people kind of are struggling a little bit\u2014and then people just get happier and happier. Sixties, people are happier; 70s, people are even happier. So, you know, as long as you\u2019ve made the kind of choices that you want to make to really age in a healthy way. Now certainly, some of it is our genetics. Some of it, we have to play the cards we\u2019re dealt. But our lifestyle choices have so much impact on how healthy we are in our 70s and 80s. And there\u2019s a real correlation between our health with our overall happiness and well-being. Tayag: I mean, I\u2019m in my late 30s, and I\u2019m starting to come across quite a bit of menopause content on social media. But a lot of it still seems to focus on the negative stuff. Hot flushes and mood swings will happen. Brain fog, sleep challenges, anxiety. And, you know, that\u2019s the stuff people hear, and that gets all the attention. But what I would love to hear from you is: What is good about menopause that we\u2019re missing? Adams: It\u2019s really, really a part of the story that deserves a little more attention\u2014that it really is so wonderful in so many ways. And menopause literally is one day in your life. It\u2019s that day when you have not had a period for a year. And then, for the whole rest of your life, you are postmenopausal. But that doesn\u2019t happen like flipping a light switch, right? It\u2019s not like you just have your periods every month, and then all of a sudden they stop. So there\u2019s this period of time called the perimenopause , which is where things are changing, and your periods become less predictable and less regular. And then you begin to space them out, and then you start getting some symptoms. And eventually you\u2019ve had no period for a year. When your periods go away, all the symptoms associated with your periods go away. So, buh-bye PMS, buh-bye pelvic pain or cramping; some people get menstrual migraines. Endometriosis is another example of a condition that is very cyclic and very related to your monthly cycles. Once your periods are gone, those tend to go away. So that\u2019s a huge benefit that we don\u2019t talk about very much. You know, because your periods have gone away, you\u2019re not worried about getting pregnant, and people\u2019s sex lives often improve because they\u2019re just\u2014they just enjoy that freedom. Maybe you end up not needing to think about your diaphragm or your cervical cap, counting your cycles if you\u2019re doing natural family planning. It\u2019s just freeing to not be thinking so much about contraception. Tayag: So is it just that the symptoms of menstruation suddenly lift, and that\u2019s what leads to the menopausal zest? Or is there something more that\u2019s gained? Adams: It\u2019s just a time in a woman\u2019s life when there\u2019s some just stepping into your power: that sense of I know who I am . And I really had a lot of the experiences and life learnings that got me to this point. And hey, you know, I\u2019ve got half of my life still ahead of me. What am I gonna do with it now? My kids are almost raised; they\u2019re in college. It\u2019s great. You know, I can have sex in the kitchen if I want to\u2014which is what one of my friends said when I said, \u201cWell, your last kid\u2019s going to college. What are you gonna do?\u201d And she said, \u201cHave sex in the kitchen.\u201d Tayag: Amazing. Adams: And that is menopausal zest. Tayag: Hey, go wild. Adams: Why not, right? Sex is supposed to be adult play. It\u2019s supposed to be fun. It\u2019s not supposed to be a burden. You\u2019re not supposed to feel guilty that you\u2019re a crummy partner and you wish you wanted it and you don\u2019t. Sex is for us, as our own well-being. You release endorphins. You feel happier. Pain becomes less intense. It\u2019s a great way to manage pain. I talk to my patients about embracing themselves as a sexual being and trying to get back in touch with what I call your erotica menu. Everyone has an erotica menu of things they like, right? Some people like porn. Some people like a back rub. Some people like erotic literature. My point when I talk about that with my patients is: Remember who you are, remember what you like, and stop thinking so much about what you wish you were giving to your partner. Instead, ask for what you want. Think about what works for you. Now, I\u2019m not at all saying that someone can\u2019t have menopausal zest and have a thrilling, wonderful second half of your life and not be sexually active. That\u2019s fine. Some people are fine not having sex. I\u2019m not worried about anyone\u2019s sex life unless it\u2019s an issue for them. But the majority of my patients over age 70 are sexually active, and they are having sex with no difficulty, no pain, no problems. Tayag: That\u2019s so incredible. Adams: Mm-hmm. [ Music .] Brennan: Yasmin, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how our beliefs about aging are often tangled up with our beliefs about appearance. Tayag: I can say for myself\u2014those two things feel pretty intertwined. Brennan: And for me, too. And you know, we don\u2019t talk that much culturally about sex in older age maybe because we are just inundated with this problematic idea that, as you age, your sexual importance decreases. Like: I\u2019m even thinking about how beauty products are literally being marketed as \u201canti-aging,\u201d which perpetuates this false dichotomy between aging and desirability. Like you must not age so you can stay \u2026 desirable. Tayag: Right. I mean, the messaging right now is: How can you freeze your body in place for as long as possible to keep looking the same age forever? It reminds me of this story I wrote for The Atlantic about baby Botox. Brennan: Which, to clarify, is not babies getting Botox, but refers to the amount of Botox that people are getting, which is a baby dose. Tayag: Yes. Like, baby Botox is this idea that you start getting small doses of Botox early on, when you\u2019re very young and don\u2019t have any wrinkles, and you can kind of freeze yourself in place. When I was in college, my side gig was working in a doctor\u2019s office who did Botox. And I would see all of these moms come in with their teenage daughters in tow. The idea is that if you never move the muscles that give you wrinkles, you\u2019ll never get the wrinkles. Brennan: Right. Tayag: I wrote about this last year, and apparently the number of 20-somethings who got Botox or other injectables jumped 71 percent from 2019 to 2022. Brennan: That is a huge jump. Tayag: Yeah. And full stop\u2014if it works for you, amazing. That\u2019s your choice. But this conversation with Dr. Adams has had me thinking that when we try to freeze our bodies or faces or what have you in a particular period of time, what benefits are we missing out on? You know, are there benefits to looking older? I remember being in my 20s starting out in my first job, and, you know, just kind of being dismissed for looking so young and naive. I remember once an older man told me that he, like, looked at me and said, \u201cOne day when your face has more gravitas, you\u2019d make an excellent news anchor.\u201d Brennan: What? Tayag: Looking back, it was a weird thing to say. I wasn\u2019t offended at the time\u2014I had taken it as a compliment, he was saying that I was pretty enough to be in front of the camera someday. But now I can see how he also suggested I didn\u2019t look serious enough to deliver news, because I was pretty and young. Brennan: I \u2026 hate that. And unfortunately\u2014I think so many of us can relate to that, right? This sense that if you\u2019re young and attractive, you can\u2019t be a serious person. But once you become older and serious-looking, there\u2019s a flip side, that you aren\u2019t seen as attractive. And, of course, it can be very gendered\u2014young men aren\u2019t dismissed as easily. Tayag: Nope. Brennan: And I think it comes from women largely being seen as sexual objects, until they\u2019re not. Tayag: Right. On some level, I imagine it would be liberating to reach an age where we aren\u2019t being evaluated primarily for our looks. Brennan: But I don\u2019t know. It feels like you\u2019re either too sexualized, or you\u2019re not seen as a sexual being. I think both can feel really loaded. Tayag: Totally. And that tension is something that Dr. Adams and I spoke a lot about. [ Music .] Adams: It\u2019s so funny, right? We\u2019re either too young, or we\u2019re too old. If we have been valued for our appearance and our external attributes, it can be really challenging to age and to find that part of ourselves changing. And I think we have to avoid internalizing those messages; it\u2019s the work of a lifetime. And I remember being a young OB-GYN surgeon, and I went into the holding area to meet my patient that morning to see her, because we were getting ready to do her hysterectomy. And I met her husband for the first time, and we talked. And I said, \u201cOkay, this is what\u2019s going to happen. Do you have any more questions before we go back?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes. When are we going to meet the surgeon?\u201d And I said, \u201cThat would be me.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou, you\u2019re going to do the surgery?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And his wife was so embarrassed. She was like, \u201cOh, my gosh, I told you.\u201d Now, I like looking older because people think I know more, right? \u2019Cause I\u2019m a doctor. So it\u2019s like, you want your doctor to be experienced, and all of that. But boy, if I were an actress or if I were something where it\u2019s all about your physical appearance, that would be tough. But, I think all of the messages that we get have to be shifted a little bit. We should be working out to be strong, not to be thin. And focus on how the choices that you make will promote your physical and emotional well-being. And if we\u2019re lucky, we have parents that teach us to listen to ourselves and trust ourselves. And we learned that from an early age. I think we\u2019re teaching people more to trust themselves. And it\u2019ll be interesting to see how that changes the experience of aging for your kids, you know, because I think people are much more aware of the importance of that than we used to be. Tayag: After the break: Menopausal zest sounds awesome, but what about the symptoms so many women struggle with during the transition? [ Music .] Tayag: Dr. Adams, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the benefits of menopausal zest, but I\u2019m curious about the transition through. It is a transition, right? Adams: Oh, absolutely. It\u2019s really unmistakable, because it\u2019s physical. You know, there are physical changes happening. And so sometimes we go through emotional changes and transitions, but boy, menopause is a physical one. It is something that ushers in this new era of your life. But I think that one of the keys for menopausal quality of life is having good health care, so that you\u2019re not suffering with hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, mood disturbance, joint pain, brain fog, vaginal dryness. And that\u2019s one of my huge missions at Stanford, in our Program in Menopause & Healthy Aging, is teaching other providers how to take care of these folks, because a lot of people were not trained. Women deserve high-quality health care, and the state of the current situation is shameful. We can\u2019t blame people for not knowing things they were not taught. But it behooves those of us who do have that expertise to share it. And one of the best resources is through an organization called the Menopause Society, which is an organization that certifies menopause experts. So you can go on their website and put in your zip code, and a whole bunch of providers who have been certified in menopause will come up. And you can find someone in your area who can help you get through this, because this is not something you want to do without a road map. You need a road map. Tayag: Okay, so what does that road map actually look like? What are some practical things people can do to manage what they are going through? Adams: Right, right, right. Well, I can take people\u2019s hot flushes and night sweats away in about three weeks with some estrogen. So if that, if it\u2019s related to menopause, it\u2019s highly, highly, highly treatable. And the only people who shouldn\u2019t take estrogen are people who themselves have had a heart attack or a stroke, people who\u2019ve had breast cancer with certain types of hormone receptors, possibly people who\u2019ve had a blood clot in their leg or their lung or their brain, some types of hormone-sensitive cancers. But most people can be on hormone therapy, and that\u2019s estrogen\u2014and if you have a uterus, you\u2019re on progesterone as well. Night sweats are part of the reason that people have difficulty with sleeping, but some of it is because of anxieties. And so we talk to our patients about some techniques for mindfulness, for mindful breathing, some different things to help you get out of your head and be able to get back to sleep. There\u2019s a thing called cognitive behavior therapy that is the most beneficial for sleep disturbance and mood disturbance in menopause. And it can also decrease the bother of hot flushes. Everyone should do it. It is such a powerful tool for dealing with all the stresses of life. And so that\u2019s something I talk to all my menopausal patients about\u2014is find some cognitive behavior therapy resources. It will really, really help. Tayag: Okay, so I want to go back to hormone therapy, because there\u2019s still a lot of misunderstanding about what it can do and the risks involved. So what happened with the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, and what does it mean for the number of women on hormone treatment today? Adams: So less than 2 percent of people who are candidates for hormone therapy are actually on hormone therapy. Which is so awful. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative was the biggest trial in women\u2019s health, at that time, and I believe to date it was 165,000 women. And it\u2019s not that it was a bad study or that it was harmful. What the Women\u2019s Health Initiative did was, they enrolled people between the ages of 50 and 79 and started them all on hormones. They had not been on hormones before. And lo and behold, what we found is the people over 70 were the ones who had heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, etc. And the people between the ages of 50 and 60 actually had benefits. And now we have 20 years of follow-up data, and we found that those people have not died of heart disease more than people who were not on hormones, nor have we had increased numbers of deaths of breast cancer. So that is the part of the message that we really have to be clear on. When you\u2019re under 60 and you don\u2019t have any of those absolute contraindications, it\u2019s really a window of opportunity. And the risk of breast cancer with it is like eight extra cases per 10,000 women; the risk of breast cancer is greater with a sedentary lifestyle or alcohol intake more than one glass of wine a night, or being obese. And people worry so much about hormones when they don\u2019t even think about the fact that they\u2019re sedentary and they\u2019re overweight. Those are much bigger risks for breast cancer. So we do talk to folks now if they\u2019re under age 60 or less than 10 years out from menopause: They\u2019re going to get tremendous benefits being on hormones. And we\u2019re working hard to get that message out. Tayag: Are you worried at all that as people realize hormone therapy could be safe for them that there\u2019s a risk that it starts to be seen as a cure-all? We see that so often in the wellness space. Adams: We recognize we have so much control over our health, and that rather than looking for the answer in a supplement or some pill that you take\u2014although there are certainly value, values to taking pills, and I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t value to that\u2014but when people come to me, and they say, \u201cIf I go on hormones, will I prevent dementia? My mother had dementia. I don\u2019t want it. If I go on hormones, will it prevent me from getting dementia?\u201d I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d We know there\u2019s some benefit in the brain when people are on hormones. But we do know what decreases the risk of dementia. And it is: Don\u2019t smoke, minimize your alcohol intake, exercise, eat mostly plants. Manage any chronic health conditions you have, like high blood pressure, diabetes, things like that. And stay connected to your family and friends and your community. Brennan: Yas, you know, it\u2019s really amazing to hear this conversation about women embracing rather than defying aging, because so much of what we hear about right now in the longevity space is focused on trying to eradicate aging all together. And I do wonder if there is something about a very physical transition like menopause that almost forces women to reckon with aging\u2014like, you can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s happening to your body when it hits you all at once. It\u2019s not something you can compartmentalize or ration yourself out of. It\u2019s a part of your everyday. And maybe people who don\u2019t go through such a sudden shift miss out on that. Tayag: Yeah, I mean, men go through changes too, as they age. They experience things like a lack of energy, weight gain, sleep problems, sexual issues. And there\u2019s been some effort to classify these changes as menopause. The male version of menopause. But there\u2019s a lot of pushback on this idea, because it\u2019s just not the same thing. What men go through isn\u2019t caused by a sudden shift in hormone levels that leads to huge transformations in their bodies. It\u2019s not like their testosterone suddenly nose-dives the way estrogen does. It decreases a little, but very gradually over a long period of time. So, there may not be a moment or a life period that marks or reinforces aging in the same visceral way. Brennan: Right. I mean, I cannot see \u201cmanopause\u201d going over very well right now in the current cultural zeitgeist. But, regardless, I think one thing that might be important to remember right now is all of these internalized ideas that Dr. Adams has been talking about in regards to aging: They affect all of us. People of all genders. So recognizing them, unpacking them, working through them\u2014that\u2019s more of a call to everyone. [ Music .] Tayag: You know, throughout this conversation, I couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019ve said \u201cwe know now\u201d so many times\u2014which is amazing, because it means \u201cYes, we know now, menopause can be awesome.\u201d So why are we so stuck on this narrative? Adams: Why are we? And I have to tell you, I would rather be 66 as I am now than pregnant. No question. No question. I wouldn\u2019t be 35 again for anything. You\u2019re trying to figure out your career. You\u2019re trying to figure out your partner. You\u2019re trying to figure out where you\u2019re going to live. You\u2019re trying to figure out\u2014are you going to have kids? Where are you going to raise them? What are you going to do? There\u2019s so much going on in our 20s and 30s that is challenging and hard, and physically we\u2019re not getting much sleep, and we\u2019re trying to progress in our careers and all of that. It\u2019s challenging. And so much of that is resolved when you\u2019re in your 50s and 60s. It\u2019s so great. It\u2019s so great. Tayag: Dr. Adams, thank you for the absolutely enlightening conversation. I am excited to enter my next decade in a way that I wasn\u2019t before we talked. So thank you. Adams: I\u2019m so glad. I\u2019m so glad. Come on in. The water is fine. [ Music .] Tayag: Natalie, as you know, I just adored this conversation with Dr. Adams. Brennan: We are two huge fans. Tayag: And, you know, a thing I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about is that, intellectually, I understand the benefits of aging. I get that it can be great in all these ways. But emotionally, it\u2019s hard to undo all those assumptions. And I find it hard to trust that I, too, am going to feel as awesome as she does at that age. Brennan: Yeah; I really can relate to that. But we can\u2019t know how we are going to feel in this life stage that we\u2019re not in yet. What we do know is that we have this testimony and affirmation from older women who do know, and I do find that really comforting. Tayag: Right. Brennan: You know, there\u2019s this poem by Mary Ruefle that this conversation really reminds me of in this way of acknowledging from where you and I are at right now. We can\u2019t even yet really understand where we\u2019re gonna land, because we haven\u2019t gone through it yet. And maybe that persists throughout your life. I remember sending the poem to my mom around the time she was going through menopause, and we both really love it and keep coming back to it. Tayag: Hmm, that\u2019s really sweet. Brennan: And, you know, maybe it could be another point of reference for you too. I\u2019m going to read you the end of this poem. Tayag: I\u2019m going to cry. [ Laughs. ] Brennan: If you are young and you are reading this, perhaps you will understand the gleam in the eye of any woman who is sixty, seventy, eighty, or ninety: they cannot take you seriously (sorry) for you are just a girl to them, despite your babies and shoes and lovemaking and all of that. You are just a girl playing at life. You\u2019re just a girl on the edge of a great forest. You should be frightened but instead you are eating a lovely meal, you are cooking one, or you are running to the florist, or you are opening a box of flowers that has just arrived at your door, and none of these things are done in the great spirit that they will later be done in. You haven\u2019t even begun. You must pause first, the way one must pause before a great endeavor, if only to take a good breath. Happy old age is coming on bare feet. Bringing with it grace and gentle words and ways which grim youth have never known. [ Music. ] Tayag: That\u2019s all for this episode of How to Age Up .

Written by David Delima | Updated: 14 April 2025 14:20 IST Photo Credit: Meta Meta's Orion smart glasses prototype was unveiled in September 2024 Highlights Apple's CEO is reportedly focused on AR glasses development The firm is looking to beat Meta, which currently offers cheaper devices Apple has yet to officially reveal any plans to make a new AR wearable Advertisement Apple CEO Tim Cook has reportedly made the development of true augmented reality (AR) glasses a \"top priority\" for the company, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman writes in his weekly Power On newsletter. The company has yet to officially confirm plans to work on a pair of AR glasses, while rivals like Google, Meta, and Snapchat have showcased prototypes of smart glasses that resemble a pair of spectacles. Unlike larger (and heavier) mixed reality headsets, AR glasses require advanced technology that must be made affordable in order to appeal to customers. Apple Debating Whether to Allow AR Glasses to Capture Media Citing an source, Gurman states that Cook is focused on developing an \"industry-leading product\" before Meta, and has been spending a lot of time on the purported AR glasses. Meta has already showcased an AR glasses prototype dubbed 'Orion', and a commercial version of the device is expected to debut in the coming years. The Facebook parent firm currently offers the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which do not include an AR component that displays text and other information. However, these glasses allow users to capture images using a camera and microphone. According to Gurman, Apple has also been working on similar wearables, but it is \"actively debating\" whether the smart glasses should be allowed to capture media. Apple Reportedly Facing These Challenges While Developing Its AR Glasses While it's unclear whether Apple will launch camera-equipped spectacles like the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, previous reports indicate that the company is working on equipping other wearables with cameras \u2014 like the Apple Watch. If Apple is successful in developing true AR glasses, the company will have to compete with other firms like Google, Meta, and Snapchat. Last week, Google showed off an XR glasses prototype at TED 2025 that can scan text and offers a 'Memory' feature. It could debut as a Samsung product by next year. Snapchat Spectacles Get GPS-Powered AR Lenses, New Hand Tracking Features Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be in Development With This Notable Upgrade Apple Said to Stop Development of AR Glasses for Mac Computers Apple's AR Glasses to Come With New Version of visionOS: Report Meta also showcased a pair of smart glasses that is referred to as 'Orion', and the company is expected to launch a commercial version (codenamed Artemis) by 2027. Snap's fifth-generation AR glasses or Spectacles were unveiled in 2024 , but there's no word on when availability will be expanded from developers to customers.

[via press release from FOX Nation] FOX NATION TO DEBUT \"GREG GUTFELD'S WHAT DID I MISS?\" IN MAY Gutfeld Tests Contestants on Real Versus Fake Headlines from the First 90 Days of Trump Administration After a Three-Month Isolation Period NEW YORK - April 14, 2025 - Greg Gutfeld, host of the eponymous number one late night show Gutfeld! and co-host of cable's most-watched program The Five, will helm a three-part game show series for FOX Nation entitled \"Greg Gutfeld's What Did I Miss?\" The first of three episodes will drop on Monday, May 12th followed by episode two and three dropping on May 13th & 14th respectively. From January 20th through April 13th of this year, four contestants were in complete isolation in upstate New York, with no contact to the outside world - no phones, internet, television, or social media. Upon their return to society, the contestants compete in an epic showdown as they are tasked with figuring out what actually happened during their seclusion. Gutfeld will present dozens of scenarios, and the contestants must separate real headlines from fake ones. With a prize of $50,000 on the line, their instincts and senses of humor will be put to the test in front of a live audience and a panel featuring Gutfeld! regulars Kat Timpf and Jamie Lissow. In making the announcement, FOX Nation President Lauren Petterson said, \"Truth can be stranger than fiction and who better to help isolated Americans catch up on the headlines they missed during an unprecedented news cycle than Greg Gutfeld. We are excited for FOX Nation subscribers to have exclusive access to America's most-watched late night host's game show debut as he informs contestants about what really happened while they were completely off the grid and isolated from the outside world.\" Gutfeld added, \"For these four contestants to learn what really happened while they were living in isolation, they'll have to get through me first. Lucky them.\" Gutfeld! (10-11 PM/ET) just delivered its highest-rated quarter in the program's four-year history with 3.3 million viewers, 453,000 in the 25-54 demo and 287,000 in the 18-49 demo. The hit show outpaced all broadcast and late-night television, including CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, NBC's The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS' After Midnight and Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In addition to his late-night role, Gutfeld serves as co-host of cable's highest-rated program The Five (5-6 PM/ET) which averaged 4.6 million viewers in 1Q '25 and topped all programs on cable for the last 14 consecutive quarters. As one of the five original hosts when the program launched in 2011, Gutfeld and the ensemble, which includes Harold Ford Jr., Dana Perino, Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov and Jesse Watters, discuss news stories, controversies, and issues of the day in spirited and spontaneous format which has become appointment viewing on cable.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Everything You Need to Know", "content": "How Accurate Is iPhone Battery Health? - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer The accuracy of iPhone battery health metrics has become a topic of growing interest and concern among users and experts alike. Apple provides tools designed to help you monitor your battery\u2019s condition, but questions about the reliability of these metrics persist. If you rely on your iPhone for daily activities, understanding how battery health is measured and its implications is essential for maintaining your device\u2019s performance and longevity. The video below from iReviews gives us more details about iPhone battery health. Watch this video on YouTube . Are Battery Health Metrics Reliable? Apple\u2019s battery health feature, accessible through the settings menu, aims to provide a clear snapshot of your battery\u2019s condition. However, many users have reported discrepancies between the battery health percentage displayed and their device\u2019s actual performance. For instance, your iPhone might indicate a high battery health percentage, yet you could still experience slower performance, reduced efficiency, or even unexpected shutdowns. These inconsistencies can create confusion, leaving you uncertain about the true state of your battery. The reliability of these metrics is further complicated by the fact that battery health is influenced by multiple factors, such as usage patterns, environmental conditions, and the natural aging process of lithium-ion batteries. While Apple\u2019s system provides a general guideline, it may not always reflect the full picture of your battery\u2019s performance. Understanding Battery Cycles and Their Role A battery cycle is defined as one complete charge and discharge cycle, and Apple states that iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 cycles. This specification is intended to give you a benchmark for when your battery might start to degrade noticeably. However, some users have observed discrepancies between the reported cycle count and their device\u2019s actual performance. For example, your iPhone might report fewer cycles than expected for its age, yet still exhibit signs of reduced battery capacity, such as shorter usage times or slower responsiveness. These mismatches can make it challenging to determine when maintenance or replacement is necessary. Understanding battery cycles is crucial because they directly impact your device\u2019s ability to hold a charge and perform efficiently over time. How Battery Degradation Affects Performance As your battery health declines, particularly below the 80% threshold, you may begin to notice significant performance issues. These can include slower app loading times, reduced responsiveness, and even unexpected shutdowns during tasks that require higher power. While Apple\u2019s battery health feature is designed to warn you when your battery\u2019s capacity has diminished, these performance issues can sometimes occur even when the reported health percentage appears acceptable. For older devices, the combination of aging hardware and a deteriorating battery can exacerbate these problems. This can lead to a frustrating user experience, as your iPhone may struggle to keep up with everyday tasks. If you encounter these symptoms, replacing the battery is often the most effective way to restore your device\u2019s performance and extend its usability. Third-Party Monitoring Tools: Helpful or Misleading? To gain additional insights into their battery\u2019s condition, some users turn to third-party monitoring tools or shortcuts that analyze analytics data. These tools can provide information such as cycle counts, capacity estimates, and other metrics not readily available through Apple\u2019s settings. However, the data provided by these tools is not always consistent with Apple\u2019s metrics, leading to further confusion. For example, a third-party tool might report a lower battery capacity or a higher cycle count than what your iPhone displays. This lack of uniformity highlights the challenges of accurately assessing battery health, even with external tools. While these tools can be helpful in some cases, it\u2019s important to approach their results with caution and use them as supplementary information rather than definitive evidence. When Should You Replace Your Battery? If your iPhone\u2019s performance has noticeably declined and the battery health metrics seem unreliable, replacing the battery is often the best solution. A new battery can significantly improve your device\u2019s speed, responsiveness, and overall usability. Apple offers battery replacement services, but there are also third-party options available. When choosing a replacement service, it is crucial to ensure that the technician is qualified and uses genuine parts. Using counterfeit or low-quality batteries can lead to further issues, including safety risks and reduced performance. Replacing your battery at the right time can extend your iPhone\u2019s lifespan and help you avoid the need for a full device upgrade. How to Stay Ahead of Battery Issues To maintain your iPhone\u2019s performance and avoid unexpected battery-related problems, consider taking the following steps: Regularly monitor your battery health through the settings menu to stay informed about its condition. Pay attention to performance changes, such as slower app response times, shorter battery life, or unexpected shutdowns. Use third-party monitoring tools cautiously, as their data may not always align with Apple\u2019s metrics and could lead to confusion. Replace your battery when performance issues become significant, especially if your device is older or the battery health percentage drops below 80%. Adopt good charging habits, such as avoiding extreme temperatures and overcharging, to prolong your battery\u2019s lifespan. Why Understanding Battery Health Matters The accuracy and reliability of iPhone battery health metrics are critical for making sure your device remains functional and efficient. While Apple\u2019s tools provide a useful starting point, they are not without limitations. By staying informed about how battery health is measured, recognizing the signs of degradation, and taking proactive steps to address issues, you can maximize your iPhone\u2019s performance and longevity. Whether through regular monitoring, cautious use of third-party tools, or timely battery replacement, understanding battery health enables you to make informed decisions and keep your device running smoothly.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . The S&P 500 plunged over 10% before rebounding 9.5% after tariff changes. Despite volatility, financial advisors urge clients to stay calm and stick to investment plans. Advisors highlight tax-loss harvesting and IRA conversions as strategies during volatility. It's been a busy week and a half for financial advisors, as their clients' portfolios have seen historic moves. The S&P 500's 10.5% plunge from April 3 to 4 was among the steepest two-day drops ever recorded in market history. The skyrocketing comeback on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump lifted his excess tariffs for most countries, brought the largest point increases in a single session for the three major indexes. By Thursday, the selling had resumed in a big way. These ground-shaking market moves spooked investors into reaching out to their advisors, according to professionals in the industry who spoke to Business Insider. \"We are taking a lot of client phone calls, for sure,\" said Tyler Meyer, a certified financial planner and the founder of Retire to Abundance. Amid the volatility, the advisors said they are stressing to clients not to panic and to stick to a pre-decided plan \u2014 which will be different for each investor. Here are some other ways the money managers are guiding their clients through all of the mayhem. Communicating early A common theme was the importance of being available to clients \u2014 whether that means sending out email blasts or being responsive to calls. Chris Hernandez at Strategic Capital Powered by Waterloo said he's calling clients himself before they reach out. \"During times like this, we really try to be proactive versus reactive and send a lot of communications out via email,\" he said. \"For our clients that we know like higher touch points, we're just kind of calling them and reminding them of the strategies we put into place.\" Keeping an eye out for tax advantages A sell-off is a good opportunity to save money on taxes going forward, according to Tyler Meyer, the founder of Retire to Abundance. Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know He said he's been guiding clients through potential tax-loss-harvesting opportunities, for example. When an investor has a stock position that is down, they can sell it at a loss and discount that loss from their total taxable income the following year. After selling, they can buy the investment back after 30 days. A market correction could also be a good opportunity to convert a traditional IRA or a 401(k) \u2014 which are taxed upon withdrawals \u2014 to a Roth IRA. The latter is taxed up front instead of when withdrawals are made. When the market is down, the tax bill that results from the conversion would naturally be lower than it would when gains are at their highest. Explaining the macroeconomic landscape Bryan Kuderna, founder of Kuderna Financial Team, sent a letter to clients on April 4 providing an overview of the macroeconomic picture, including a lesson on tariffs, what the best and worst-case scenarios would be for investors, his personal outlook, and the risks of buying and selling in this market. \"My goal is to bring you up to speed, add some clarity during unclear times, and offer some peace of mind,\" he wrote in the letter. Reminding clients of prior downturns It can be easy to forget the feeling of panic that emerges during a slide in prices because there are often years between major sell-offs. \"People forget in good times how ugly and volatile things can get,\" said Melissa Cox, the owner of Future-Focused Wealth. But it's important to remember that the market eventually recovers, and sometimes quite quickly \u2014 which investors don't want to miss out on, said Chris Chen of Insight Financial Strategists. \"In 1987 it dropped 22%\" in a single day, he pointed out. \"And then it bounced back up immediately.\" He added: \"I think it's really dangerous to be out of the market right now.\" Taking profits and preserving clients' peace of mind Hernandez works with many Apple employees. As shares of the smartphone producer have gotten hammered by 23% thanks to tariffs, Hernandez has helped his clients execute a plan to sleep a little better at night. Many of his clients have built up a stockpile of shares in the company over many years, and he said some of them have decided to cut their positions by 15-20% to take a portion of their profits off the table. \"I always say money is both logical and emotional, so logically maybe they feel like they should hold onto the stock, but it's keeping them up at night,\" he said.

Five units will be put into service at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Terminal 1, ferrying customers from gate G1 at the main terminal building to gate C1 at the satellite terminal. The service complements the usual shuttle bus transfer and mirrors the one offered by Malaysia Airlines for its Business Class, utilising the Mercedes-Benz EQS500 and S580e to ply the same route. The shuttles are necessary because the airport\u2019s aerotrains are still in the midst of being replaced, having been delayed once again from the planned January completion date. It was last reported that the trains are due to begin service in the current quarter, per Malay Mail . \u201cTravel should be effortless, and at Batik Air, we believe our Business Class guests deserve nothing less,\u201d said Batik Air CEO Chandran Rama Muthy. \u201cThis VIP Transfer Service isn\u2019t just about moving between terminals\u2014it\u2019s about redefining the journey with innovation, care and a touch of exclusivity.\u201d Stellantis ASEAN managing director Isaac Yeo added: \u201cThe Leapmotor C10 redefines premium travel, delivering unparalleled comfort and sophistication for discerning passengers. This exceptional electric SUV embodies our vision for environmentally responsible mobility while offering a seamless and refined experience\u2014both on the road and beyond the airport tarmac.\u201d The C10 is the first local offering from Chinese brand Leapmotor, priced at RM159,700 on-the-road without insurance. For that money, you get a single rear motor that produces 218 PS (160 kW) and 320 Nm, enough to get the D-segment crossover from zero to 100 km/h in 7.5 seconds on its way to a top speed of 170 km/h. A 69.9 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery provides a WLTP range of 424 km. The massive 4,759 mm long five-seater SUV comes standard with full-LED lighting, sporty 20-inch \u201cTrident\u201d alloy wheels, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.6-inch centre touchscreen, Oeko-Tex faux leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats, a Qi wireless charger, 12 speakers, a 360-degree camera system a powered tailgate, seven airbags and Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities.

AI image: Midjourney/Cult of Mac After the U.S. government seemed to exempt iPhones, Macs and other electronics from hefty tariffs Friday, a clarification issued Sunday by President Donald Trump revealed that\u2019s not the case. Trump said on Truth Social that his administration did not announce a tariff exemption Friday. Instead, the \u201cexisting 20% Fentanyl Tariffs\u201d will still apply to electronics \u2014 with higher tariffs possibly coming soon. Nope, Trump did not exempt iPhones and Macs from reciprocal tariffs Since taking office, President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all major manufacturing countries with heavy import tariffs. True to his word, he announced a significant increase in import tariffs last week on goods imported from major Asian manufacturing hubs. The president eventually backtracked, suspending the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. China was the only exception, being hit with a hefty 145% tariff. Then, late Friday, the Trump administration announced what seemed like a tariff exemption for electronic items and semiconductors imported from China. However \u2014 as with so much of the craziness surrounding Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 that didn\u2019t last long. In a Sunday post on Truth Social , the president clarified that no country is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for its unfair trade practices. More importantly, he said his administration did not provide tariff exemptions Friday. Electronics, TVs, semiconductors and flash drives will continue to face a 20% tariff aimed at punishing countries Trump accuses of exporting the deadly drug fentanyl into the United States. The U.S. government is simply moving these products to a \u201cdifferent Tariff \u2018bucket,'\u201d Trump wrote. Providing further clarification, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government provided certain electronics items with only temporary exemptions. These items will become subject to \u201csemiconductor tariffs\u201d set to take effect within a month or two. \u201cAll those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they\u2019re going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\u201d Lutnick said Sunday on ABC News show This Week. \u201cWe need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can\u2019t be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\u201d Apple devices are safe from tariffs \u2026 for now For now, iPhones, Macs and other electronic devices remain safe from the 10% global tariffs implemented by Trump. However, this will change in the future as the U.S. government decides on a \u201cspecial focus\u201d tariff for semiconductors. Apple reportedly stockpiled iPhones before implementation of the proposed tariffs , which would have gone into effect last week. It could do the same over the next one or two months as the Trump administration finalizes its new semiconductor tariff.

By Hadlee Simons \u2022 Published on April 14, 2025 \u2022 0 \u2022 Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority TL;DR Apple\u2019s foldable iPhone will apparently have an under-display camera on the folding screen. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices have offered this feature since 2021. This camera is nearly invisible but has noticeably inferior image quality compared to a conventional selfie camera. Apple is widely tipped to launch its first foldable iPhone next year, and we\u2019ve already seen a few rumors about this device. Now, it sounds like this new foldable phone could adopt a rather interesting camera borrowed from Samsung. Frequent tipster Digital Chat Station has claimed on Weibo that Apple\u2019s upcoming foldable phone will feature an under-display selfie camera on the folding screen. Meanwhile, the cover display is said to have a camera in a cutout. Weibo/Digital Chat Station In other words, Apple would be copying Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices by adopting an under-display selfie camera for the folding display. 2021\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 3 was the first foldable with this camera and last year\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 6 maintained this feature. Under-display cameras hide under the screen and are nearly invisible, making for a more immersive screen viewing experience. However, these cameras have poor image quality compared to conventional selfie cameras. This is because the display blocks a lot of light from hitting the camera sensor. So you really shouldn\u2019t expect this camera to take great photos on Apple\u2019s foldable. For what it\u2019s worth, we thought the under-display shooter on the Z Fold 6 was only good for video calls and that the cover display camera was better. Digital Chat Station reiterated that the foldable iPhone will have a 7.76-inch folding screen and a 5.49-inch cover display. However, they also revealed that the folding screen would have a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution while the cover display is poised to have a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution. Either way, it sounds like Apple is adopting a squat form factor like the original Pixel Fold and OPPO Find N2 rather than the tall and narrow form factor adopted by Samsung. Got a tip? Talk to us!

There are multiple ways companies can buy renewable energy. Each comes with its own challenges, and some can leave corporate buyers open to accusations of greenwashing. Key Highlights On-site generation is the most robust procurement method but has extremely high upfront costs. On-site generation refers to producing energy at the site where it will be consumed. This is an expensive procurement method, as it has high upfront and maintenance costs, but it guarantees 100% renewable energy (RE100) for a company's facilities. This method is best suited for companies with a low number of facilities or large corporations with the capital to invest in new power plants. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming more popular. PPAs are long-term contracts between a clean electricity generator and a customer. PPAs may last up to 25 years, during which time the buyer purchases energy at a pre-negotiated price. High credit requirements make PPAs most appropriate for companies that can guarantee continuous energy demand over a long period of time. Supply contracts are the more suitable option for smaller enterprises without the opportunity for on-site generation. This report analyzes renewable energy procurement methods, including on-site renewable generation, power purchase agreements (PPAs), supply contracts, and energy attribute certificates (EACs).It also evaluates the main challenges to renewable energy procurement, including oversupply, price pressures, and skyrocketing demand.

Washington, United States: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining the market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Home News You are here The one to take on the Galaxy S26 and iPhone 18 will probably pack a 7,000 mAh battery By Sebastian Pier Published: Apr 14, 2025, 3:09 AM 0 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Apple Xiaomi Galaxy S Series iPhone Up Next: The Galaxy S25 and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro for reference. | Image credit \u2013 PhoneArena Come 2026, the phone industry will meet the Galaxy S26 and the iPhone 18 \u2013 unless both Samsung and Apple go with different monikers \u2013 and these two flagships will have to deal with a phone that could arrive with a mind-boggling battery. It's the Xiaomi 16 that is rumored to pack a 7,000 mAh battery next year, when it materializes. The popular Weibo (a large Chinese social media platform) tipster by the nickname of Smart Pikachu is the one who predicts it: Image source \u2013 Weibo In these current times of ours, rumors about a phone with such a massive battery is certainly not that much of a surprise. After all, Honor might be unveiling a handset with a massive 8,000 mAh capacity cell under the hood. We're now entering Android's Big Battery Era , as my colleague Alan underscored the other day. Some tipsters say Android flagships from the recent future could reach battery capacities of up to 7,500 mAh. The Red Magic 10 Pro, for example, already features a 7,050 mAh battery, and rumors suggest the OnePlus 14 may come with a 7000 mAh battery (the OnePlus 13 has a 6,000 mAh cell). Receive the latest Samsung news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . What's notable about the possibility of the Xiaomi 16 to pack a 7,000 mAh battery is that the phone could be \"compact\", at least in the flagship category\u2026 and if Xiaomi keeps the dimensions of the Xiaomi 15 , a 6.36-inch phone. Battery technology advancements are super cool: it's not just owners of tile-sized phones that can enjoy superb battery life. Those among us who cherish compact devices will not be left behind, and this is the kind of news that gives a nice start to the week. Xiaomi 16 is still too ahead in time to be discussed in detail, but we're about to meet another compact flagship with a massive battery real soon: the OnePlus 13T. This flagship killer is expected to launch with a 6,200 mAh battery (for reference, the Galaxy S25 Ultra packs a 5,000 mAh capacity cell) and the maxed-out Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It's also rumored to be under 189 grams, thanks to its \"Glacier battery\", developed with battery giant CATL a year ago. Designed to stay cool under pressure, the cell technology helps improve both battery life and performance. Compact phones often overheat during gaming while charging, leading to a poor experience, so keeping the battery cool is crucial. Did you enjoy reading this article?

However, it seems that there is a slight twist, and the tax relief will only be short-lived. According to the Trump administration, the 125 percent reciprocal tariff relief is only temporary, and the taxes will continue to be applied to smartphones, laptops, and more in the coming \"month or two.\" Apple's exemption from the 'reciprocal' tariff is only temporary, as the Trump administration will announce a new solution in a month or two We have previously reported that US Customs and Border Protection published exclusions from the list of imports that are bound to follow Trump's new 125 percent reciprocal tariff on China along with the base 10 percent global tariff. As mentioned, the exclusions revolved around \u201csmartphones, laptop computers, hard drives, computer processors, and memory chips.\u201d Related Story Apple Uses New Tech That Compares Synthetic Data With Real Emails To Train AI Models, Then Applies Embeddings And Privacy Tools To Improve Text Output Quality Apple would have adhered to a total tariff of 145 percent, which includes the 125 percent reciprocal tax and 20 percent fentanyl tax, which President Trump emphasized in a post on Truth Social today. Currently, it is capped at 20 percent, and based on the information, the relaxation is temporary as the exemption from the reciprocal tariff is not a \"permanent sort of exemption,\" according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik. Lutnik stated in an interview with ABC News that the tech sector would receive a \"special focus type of tariff \" (via The Verge ), emphasizing that the social tariff would include products like the iPhone. President Donald Trump's remarks on Truth Social were quite similar, as he also claimed that the administration would take a closer look at semiconductors and the \"whole electronics supply chain\" in the forthcoming tariff investigation. We can safely presume that the Trump administration would announce a special tax for the tech industry at a later date, possibly in a month or two, as per the officials. The tariff could be less than the current 125 percent reciprocal tax but could be higher than it was before. For Apple, it means that reliance on China for components and semiconductors would no longer be a long-term solution, as it would seek imports from India and Vietnam. The company could also ramp up its investments in the regions and compel its suppliers to do the same as well. Currently, Apple does manufacture its products in Vietnam, which includes the new M4 MacBook Air and M3 Ultra Mac Studio, but the supply is quite limited compared to China's vast manufacturing facilities. We will keep you posted on the latest, so do stick around for more details.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that smartphones, computer monitors, and various electronic components are among the exempted items. This means Apple has dodged another bullet \u2014 again. This news is clearly good for Apple and for us as customers in the short term. However, it\u2019s also a flashing red warning for the future. Apple currently assembles over 90% of its iPhones in China. That represents an enormous concentration of risk in one country. That\u2019s too much for any company, and certainly too much for a company shipping hundreds of millions of devices annually to customers worldwide. I fully acknowledge that moving iPhone manufacturing out of China isn\u2019t as simple as flipping a switch. Apple has spent decades meticulously building that supply chain, a masterpiece of logistics and precision manufacturing. But global trade dynamics are evolving rapidly, and Apple can\u2019t afford to stand still. This isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about resilience. Apple has executed Herculean efforts before. Now is another moment when they must rise to the occasion. Diversifying their manufacturing base might be the single most critical long-term move they can make right now. (That sentence was difficult to write because I also believe they need to fix their Siri/AI issues. But ultimately, they need to ship iPhone devices regardless of their current limitations.)", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/04/apple-dodges-another-bullet/", "source": "Macsparky.com", "published_at": "2025-04-14T08:00:35"}, {"id": 311, "title": "Convenience Drives Digital Wallet Use for More Than Half of Consumers", "content": "Convenience Drives More Than Half of Digital Wallet Use Convenience Drives More Than Half of Digital Wallet Use Convenience Drives Digital Wallet Use for More Than Half of Consumers By PYMNTS | April 14, 2025 | Budget-conscious consumers reach for debit cards to maintain financial discipline, while the allure of rewards continues to fuel credit card use. The PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201c How People Pay: Budgeting Anxiety Drives Debit Card Usage \u201d shed light on the nuanced decision making behind payment method selection in brick-and-mortar stores and across digital channels. The report, a comprehensive survey of 2,552 U.S. consumers conducted in August, uncovered a fundamental tension between consumers seeking to manage their spending and those prioritizing financial incentives. This dichotomy played out differently depending on the shopping environment. For in-store purchases, debit cards and cash were favored by those focused on budgeting and convenience, with 14% of debit card users and 20% of cash users citing budget management as a key reason for their choice. Conversely, credit card use in-store was predominantly driven by the desire for rewards or cash back, cited by 40% of users. Security concerns also factored into in-store choices, with cash being the preferred method for consumers prioritizing payment security. The online landscape presented a slightly different picture, although the underlying themes of budgeting and incentives persisted. Budget-minded online shoppers gravitated toward debit cards, with roughly a quarter highlighting the ease of tracking payments and 14% emphasizing budget control. Security became a more prominent factor in online transactions, with 8.3% of credit card users citing better security compared to 4.8% of debit card users. Despite this, the primary driver for online credit card use remained rewards, attracting one-third of users. Digital wallets emerged as a strong contender for online convenience, with 55% of users citing them as their main reason, higher than debit or credit cards. Trust in the provider played a larger role for PayPal users compared to those using Google Pay or Apple Pay . Other key findings from the report: Forty percent of consumers using credit cards in-store were motivated by rewards or cash back. This highlighted the continued power of incentive programs in driving credit card adoption for physical purchases. Convenience was the top motivator for online debit card use, cited by 44% of users. This underscored the importance of seamless transaction experiences in the digital realm for debit card holders. Fifty-five percent of online digital wallet users prioritized convenience. This demonstrated the growing appeal of digital wallets for their ease and efficiency in eCommerce . Beyond these key takeaways, the report delved into other compelling aspects of consumer payment behavior. For instance, it explored the motivations behind digital wallet use in physical stores, where convenience was also the leading factor, albeit by a smaller margin compared to online transactions. The report also differentiated between various digital wallet providers, noting the importance of brand trust for PayPal users.

By learning how to optimize these features, you can maximize your device\u2019s efficiency, extend its lifespan, and ensure a smoother user experience. In the video below, iReviews explores ten common mistakes and provides actionable tips to help you make the most of your iPhone. Watch this video on YouTube . 1. Misusing the App Switcher Many users believe that frequently closing apps in the app switcher conserves battery life, but this practice can have the opposite effect. When you force-close an app, your iPhone must reload it entirely the next time you open it, consuming more energy and system resources. Instead, allow iOS to manage background apps automatically\u2014it is designed to optimize memory and battery usage efficiently. Trusting the system to handle this process can improve your device\u2019s overall performance and reduce unnecessary strain. 2. Overusing Wireless Charging Wireless charging offers unparalleled convenience, but excessive reliance on it can lead to overheating, which gradually degrades your iPhone\u2019s battery health. To mitigate this, alternate between wireless and wired charging methods. Additionally, ensure your wireless charging pad is certified and placed in a well-ventilated area to prevent heat buildup. By taking these precautions, you can maintain your battery\u2019s longevity and avoid unnecessary wear. 3. Allowing Heat Exposure Heat is one of the most significant threats to your iPhone\u2019s internal components. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures\u2014such as leaving your device in direct sunlight or using bulky cases during intensive tasks like gaming or charging\u2014can cause permanent damage. If your iPhone feels hot, remove the case and allow it to cool naturally. Avoid placing your device in environments prone to extreme heat, such as car dashboards or outdoor surfaces, to protect its hardware and performance. 4. Mismanaging Location Services Location services are essential for apps like navigation and weather, but leaving them enabled for all apps can drain your battery and compromise your privacy. To optimize this feature, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Location Services and enable it only for apps that genuinely require it. Whenever possible, select the \u201cWhile Using the App\u201d option to limit unnecessary tracking. This simple adjustment can significantly improve battery life and enhance your privacy. 5. Ignoring Auto-Lock Settings Failing to configure the auto-lock feature can lead to unnecessary battery drain and increase the risk of unauthorized access to your device. To safeguard your iPhone, set it to lock automatically after a short period of inactivity. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and choose a one- or two-minute interval. This setting not only conserves energy but also enhances the security of your personal data. 6. Leaving AirDrop Always On AirDrop is a convenient tool for sharing files, but keeping it enabled at all times can drain your battery and expose your device to potential security vulnerabilities. When not in use, disable AirDrop by swiping down to access the Control Center, tapping AirDrop, and selecting \u201cReceiving Off.\u201d Enable it only when you need to transfer files. This small habit can improve battery efficiency and reduce the risk of unauthorized file sharing. 7. Using Cellular Data Instead of Wi-Fi Relying on cellular data instead of Wi-Fi consumes significantly more battery power. Whenever possible, connect to a secure Wi-Fi network to reduce energy usage and improve connection stability. Additionally, you can disable cellular data for apps that don\u2019t require it by going to Settings > Cellular and toggling off unnecessary apps. This not only conserves battery life but also helps you manage your data usage more effectively. 8. Overloading iCloud Storage iCloud is a powerful tool for syncing and backing up data, but allowing too many apps to access it can result in excessive background activity and storage issues. To manage this, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud and review which apps have access. Disable iCloud syncing for apps that don\u2019t need it to free up storage space and reduce unnecessary activity. This ensures your iPhone operates more efficiently while keeping your cloud storage organized. 9. Skipping Software Updates Outdated software can leave your iPhone vulnerable to bugs, glitches, and security threats. Regular updates not only fix these issues but also introduce new features and performance improvements. To streamline this process, enable automatic updates by going to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates. Keeping your device up-to-date ensures it remains secure and operates at peak efficiency without requiring constant manual intervention. 10. Neglecting Regular Reboots Restarting your iPhone periodically can refresh system processes, resolve minor glitches, and enhance overall performance. This simple habit ensures smoother operation and helps your device run more efficiently. To reboot your iPhone, press and hold the power button, then follow the on-screen instructions. Incorporating this practice into your routine can prevent small issues from escalating and keep your device running optimally. By addressing these common mistakes, you can significantly improve your iPhone\u2019s performance, battery life, and security. Small adjustments\u2014such as managing location services, alternating charging methods, and rebooting regularly\u2014can make a noticeable difference in how efficiently your device operates. Take control of your iPhone\u2019s features today to enjoy a more reliable and seamless user experience.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Zak Doffman writes about security, surveillance and privacy. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 03:54am EDT Share Save Comment All change for Gmail. NurPhoto via Getty Images Interesting times for Gmail. Google has confirmed that its two new headline upgrades don\u2019t actually work together, raising awkward questions for its 3 billion users. And so all those users now must grapple with a new upgrade decision, one with major implications for the future direction of the platform and for what Google does next. We\u2019re talking AI, security and privacy. The two upgrades that clash are a kind of quasi end-to-end encryption and an AI-fueled search alternative that promises a markedly different quality of results. Unfortunately, Google can\u2019t see your fully encrypted emails (rightly so), and must exclude those emails from its AI search results. This will not be a one-off situation. Cloud-based AI features and device-based security do not work well together, leaving users with some tough decisions to make. Apple had seemed to resolve this with its Private Cloud Compute, but then its disastrous Apple Intelligence delays made all that somewhat academic for the time being at least. Forbes Google\u2019s Messages Update Just Made Android More Like iPhone By Zak Doffman Newsweek has now neatly framed the decision facing Gmail users: \u201cAllow Gmail to use AI-driven tools by enabling \u2018smart features\u2019 and data sharing, [or] MORE FOR YOU Netflix\u2019s Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic Score Fed Official Confirms Trump Tariff Bailout Is Ready Amid $30 Trillion Market \u2018Panic\u2019 Warning Gmail And Microsoft 2FA Security Bypass \u2014 Take Action Now, Users Told decline the use of AI tools, which limits certain features but offers stronger data privacy.\u201d But this isn\u2019t a simple yes or no. Gmail and other email platforms are driving towards an AI future and it won\u2019t be that easy to disable all the AI settings. Remember, Google has access to all your content anyway in its cloud servers. The only real opt-out (bar changing a bunch of admin settings) is to fully secure your emails. And on that, the caveats and qualifiers around Gmail\u2019s end-to-end encryption highlight how difficult a medium email is to fully secure. Even with Advanced Data Protection enabled, Apple Mail is one of the only exceptions to what can be end-to-end encrypted on iPhone. As Apple explains, \u201ciCloud Mail does not use end-to-end encryption because of the need to interoperate with the global email system,\u201d albeit \u201call native Apple email clients support optional S/MIME for message encryption.\u201d Beyond email, this new AI decision is not specific to Gmail. You will see variations from multiple other platforms in the coming months. WhatsApp\u2019s new Advanced Chat Privacy stops users exporting entire chats or saving media to their phone gallery \u2014 easily bypassed of course, but also stops engagement with Meta AI within a chat. Ask yourself why. Again, new AI updates and security and privacy don\u2019t work well together. Forbes U.S. iPhone, Android Users At Risk From New Chinese Attacks By Zak Doffman Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u201c will now remember your old conversations ,\u201d which sounds great until you consider the privacy implications of all that personal data being stored in a readily accessible way. In all likelihood nothing has changed from a data standpoint, except the optics. But even as Sam Altman posted his excitement at \u201cAI systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized,\u201d the move unsurprisingly \u201c sparked privacy concerns .\u201d Users can choose to opt out of ChatGPT\u2019s update, but just as with Gmail, there is no sensible level of user education and understanding. What are the risks and trade-offs? What happens to your data and how is it secured and safeguarded? Is there even a common syntax to explain this choice across platforms? Specifically on Gmail \u2014 yes, you must decide whether you want AI marauding across your data, but you also need to be clear on the pros and cons of email itself. It\u2019s not a fully secure platform and is open to malware, phishing and spam. All of that will also get worse as the trickle of AI attacks becomes a tidal wave. In reality, there\u2019s a much larger rethink required. My recommendation is to keep all that in mind as you decide. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

The US President, 78, has put tariffs up to 145 percent on Chinese goods whilst announcing a 90-day tariff pause for most other countries. This includes a 10 percent baseline on most imports. And then just last week (11 April), the US Customs and Border Protection looked to have revealed a long list of tech products that would be exempt from tariffs. This included products like smartphones, laptops and TVs. Advert Tariff exemptions would have been welcomed by tech firms, such as Apple , who rely on China to manufacture a reported 80 percent of its products and 90 percent of their iPhones . When talking to ABC News, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said such exemptions would only be temporary as they would be part of the tariffs yet to come 'in a month or two'. However, Trump insisted last night (13 April) that 'nobody is getting off the hook' with tariff exemptions. Taking to his social media platform, Truth Social, he wrote in a lengthy post that 'NOBODY is getting 'off the hook' for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!' Advert He explained that 'there was no tariff exception announced on Friday', as the products were 'just moving to a different Tariff bucket'. \"The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,\" Trump added. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. Donald Trump insisted that 'nobody is getting off the hook' with tariff exemptions (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) \"What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. Advert \"We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!\" The businessman promised to provide 'more and better paying jobs, making products in our nation, and treating other countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.' This comes after Trump was asked in a press conference if he would consider putting the tariffs up if a deal wasn't met with other countries. Trump has issued somewhat of a u-turn (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) \"Well, that's what would happen,\" he said. \"I mean, if we can't make the deal that we want to make or we have to make or that's good for both parties - and it's got to be good for both parties - then we go back to where we were. Advert \"We'll have to see what happens at that time.\" Meanwhile, China has raised tariffs on US goods to 125 percent after Chinese president Xi Jinping warned that 'there are no winners in a tariff war'. During a recent broadcast, he said: \u201cFor more than 70 years, China has always relied on itself and hard work for development, never relying on favours from anyone, and not fearing any unreasonable suppression.\u201d Featured Image Credit: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Topics: Politics , Donald Trump Anish Vij Anish is a Journalist at LADbible Group and is a GG2 Young Journalist of the Year 2025.

They have carefully enriched the digital experience, contributing to multi-billion dollar success. Thousands of banks and Fintechs try to tap into the same principles. In this article, we\u2019ll uncover 13 iconic UX innovations from the world\u2019s top tech giants\u2014and show you exactly how to adapt these brilliant insights for financial services. Because if a single tap can revolutionize e-commerce, just think what it could do for your financial brand. Let\u2019s dive in. Of course, the rise of AI is transforming the world and the way we interact with digital services, making its integration into future banking solutions all but inevitable. Yet, many banks and financial institutions still haven\u2019t adopted the very digital innovations that have already proven their worth in the world\u2019s largest tech companies. You will likely recognize the 13 user experience (UX) innovations featured in this article; most of us use them daily. These innovations were central to the success of multi-billion-dollar tech corporations\u2014yet they\u2019re surprisingly underutilized in financial services. How can banks and Fintechs leverage these proven UX strategies to transform generic copycut products into unique experiences that increase user engagement, build trust and increase key business metrics? Historically, the banking industry has struggled with a reputation for complexity and formality. However, today\u2019s consumers expect the same frictionless and rich experiences they enjoy in e-commerce and digital entertainment. Advanced banks and Fintechs are discovering that even small design tweaks can translate into major gains in customer satisfaction and revenue. Applying 13 Iconic UX Innovations to Financial Services Below are 13 widely cited examples of interface adjustments\u2014such as refining a single button or streamlining the onboarding process\u2014that drove significant improvements in both business outcomes and user experience. While they may appear modest, these best practices solve pressing user needs and have already become the standard across digital products in multiple industries. At UXDA we refer to this with our \u201cdopamine banking\u201d approach: using UX design to create micro-rewards and positive emotional triggers that keep users engaged, satisfied and returning to digital financial service. The core idea is that seemingly minor updates to enrich user experience can deliver remarkable returns in customer adoption, engagement and gained revenue. Dopamine, frequently called the \u201cfeel-good\u201d neurotransmitter, is released when users perceive rewards or positive outcomes. By aligning UX choices with these reward mechanisms, financial institutions can guide user behavior while raising overall satisfaction. Because these UX techniques have gained amazing results in the world's top digital services, a lack of them can place your product at a competitive disadvantage. Let\u2019s explore how these small but powerful interface design enhancements can generate unexpectedly large benefits for financial services: 1. One-Tap Actions Example: Amazon\u2019s \u201cOne-Click\u201d Checkout Instead of requiring users to fill in shipping and payment details repeatedly, Amazon introduced a single-click purchase flow once the user\u2019s information was saved. Drastically reduced cart abandonment by removing friction. Demonstrated how investing in a single, streamlined flow could transform the entire experience. \u201cOne-Click\u201d became one of Amazon\u2019s competitive advantages, credited with boosting conversion and recurring orders. Why It Matters: Eliminates friction: Streamlined workflows for common banking transactions (e.g., paying bills or sending peer-to-peer transfers) reduce dropout rates. Boosts engagement: Customers who see banking as fast and convenient are more likely to open and use the app frequently. Creates loyalty: By removing repetitive tasks, banks can delight users with near-instant, secure transactions. Implementation Tips: After user identity verification (via Face ID or a PIN), provide a single-button action: \u201cPay This Bill\u201d or \u201cSend $50 to John.\u201d Offer a short confirmation step for high-value transactions to reassure users. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Gratification: When users pay a bill or send money with a single tap, they receive immediate feedback (\u201cPayment successful!\u201d), which provides a quick sense of accomplishment. That momentary success can release dopamine as the brain recognizes a goal was achieved with minimal effort. Reduced Friction: Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for friction, which can dampen positive emotion. The simpler the flow, the clearer the reward path. Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and in control because they accomplished a meaningful task (paying a bill, making a transfer) with little friction. This positive emotional signal can reinforce future usage. 2. Minimalist First Screen Example: Google Search\u2019s Simplified Homepage From the earliest days, Google maintained a minimalist homepage, focusing on a single search bar and little else. Over the years, they\u2019ve retained that simplicity, carefully avoiding clutter. The clean, simple interface helped users find what they needed faster, becoming a hallmark of Google\u2019s brand. Lightning-quick load times enhanced user satisfaction, keeping Google as the world\u2019s leading search engine. This design choice arguably paved the way for \u201cless is more\u201d in modern UI design. Why It Matters: Reduces cognitive load: Users can find critical information (e.g., balances, upcoming payments) at a glance. Improves speed and learning curve: A clean screen with fewer elements typically loads faster, which boosts app performance ratings and is more intuitive for newcomers. Enhances brand clarity: Simple design conveys confidence and modernity, often associated with trust and authority. Implementation Tips: Make the landing screen highly focused: show only key balances, upcoming payments and a primary action (e.g., \u201cSend Money\u201d or \u201cPay Bill\u201d). Hide or tuck away secondary features, ensuring the main page remains uncluttered. Dopamine Trigger: Visual Clarity and Calm: Overly cluttered dashboards can trigger anxiety and reduce attention, blocking the potential release of dopamine associated with navigating something clear and intuitive. Sense of Mastery: A minimalist dashboard that focuses on top tasks gives users a sense that they know exactly where to go\u2014mastery itself can be rewarding and can produce small dopamine hits. Emotional Effect: Users feel relieved and confident rather than overwhelmed. This sense of calm clarity helps them trust the app, making them more open to exploring other features. 3. Personalized Suggestions Example: Netflix\u2019s Seamless Auto-Play and Personalization Netflix introduced auto-play of previews and next episodes, along with a dynamic UI that personalizes title images and recommendations for each viewer. Substantially increased viewer engagement and watch time by reducing friction (no more manual browsing). Encouraged binge-watching behaviors, driving up retention and subscription renewals. Reinforced Netflix\u2019s image as a data-driven, user-centered streaming platform. Why It Matters: Creates relevant user journeys: Contextual nudges like \u201cYou could save $X by refinancing\u201d or \u201cTry our new savings plan\u201d resonate more when tailored to the user\u2019s financial profile. Increases product uptake: Users are more inclined to explore new features or products when prompted with concrete, personalized benefits. Builds advisory value: Over time, customers see the bank as a trusted advisor rather than a mere transaction processor. Implementation Tips: Provide contextual offers: \u201cBased on your spending behavior, you could save $X per month if you\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou have $Y available in savings\u2014would you like to explore investing?\u201d Use spending patterns or deposit trends to offer personalized suggestions. Employ simple infographics or progress bars to explain how each recommendation can benefit the user. Dopamine Trigger: Personal Relevance and Novelty: Unexpected or relevant suggestions (\u201cYou can earn 2% more interest!\u201d) provide a pleasant surprise, stimulating dopamine through novelty and perceived reward potential. Timely Interventions: Well-timed prompts (e.g., \u201cYou have $300 left this month\u2014why not set aside $50 in savings?\u201d) give the user a sense of immediate reward for taking a beneficial action. Emotional Effect: Users feel cared for by the bank, experiencing positive emotions from receiving relevant, seemingly tailor-made tips or deals. The bank shifts from a faceless institution to a helpful advisor. 4. High-Quality Visuals Example: Airbnb\u2019s Emphasis on High-Quality Photos Early on, Airbnb discovered that better photos drove more bookings. They made photo quality a prominent part of their listing creation and updated the platform UI to feature large, appealing images. Listings with professional photos earned more views and significantly higher booking rates. Simplified the user journey: travelers could more easily judge the property, which boosted trust and conversions. This visual-first approach became a core design principle for Airbnb, helping them scale globally. Why It Matters: Conveys professionalism: Clean, high-resolution images, intuitive icons and well-structured graphs reinforce the bank\u2019s credibility. Enhances feature adoption: Users are more likely to try budgeting tools, investment products or robo-advisory solutions if the interfaces look polished and easy to understand. Humanizes the brand: Featuring real customer support avatars or representative photos can reassure users that people are behind the scenes. Implementation Tips: Make all your service interfaces aesthetically pleasing, modern and consistently authentic to your brand identity. Replace generic stock images and icons with consistent, authentic illustrations and icons that reflect your brand identity. Ensure all charts and dashboards use clear color coding and labeling for quick comprehension. Use clear, confidence-inspiring illustrations and real images of your representatives or customer support teams. Provide visual dashboards for spending, savings goals or investment performance to reinforce transparency. Dopamine Trigger: Aesthetic Pleasure: Attractive, cohesive visuals can spark aesthetic appreciation, a subtle dopamine release when encountering good design. Emotional Safety: Seeing modern, clean dashboards and friendly illustrations can reduce stress and create a welcoming environment, making it easier for users to feel a small emotional \u201clift.\u201d Emotional Effect: Users experience greater trust and comfort, which is critical in finance. This emotional security can heighten positive user experiences and keep them coming back. 5. Streamlined Onboarding Example: Basecamp\u2019s Simplified Signup Flow The team behind Basecamp is famous for minimalist designs. One change they cite repeatedly is removing unnecessary fields in the signup process and clarifying each step of the workflow. Lowered the barrier to entry, leading to a jump in completed signups. Reinforced the brand\u2019s commitment to frictionless user experiences. Provided a template for many SaaS products that copied the \u201cless friction, more clarity\u201d signup ethos. Why It Matters: Shortens time to value: The faster users can open an account or apply for a loan, the sooner they\u2019ll start engaging with your services. Reduces abandonment: Fewer forms and clearer step-by-step instructions mean less friction and dropout. Enhances perception of modernity: Smooth digital onboarding sets your bank apart from clunky, time-consuming competitors. Implementation Tips: Use progressive forms: show only what\u2019s needed at each step (e.g., personal info, then ID verification, then income details). Integrate real-time validation to catch errors on the spot (e.g., incorrect ID format). Remove extraneous fields or combine them smartly. Dopamine Trigger: Progress Feedback and Small Wins: Breaking down account creation into manageable steps (with real-time feedback) gives the user multiple mini \u201cwins,\u201d each capable of sparking a dopamine release. Reduced Anxiety: A simpler process means less cognitive load, so users can be more receptive to the small emotional highs of completion. Emotional Effect: Users feel accomplished at each step instead of stressed or frustrated. This sense of steady progress encourages them to finish onboarding and remain engaged afterward. 6. Referral Prompts Example: Dropbox\u2019s \u201cGet Space\u201d Referral Prompt Dropbox made a small tweak to highlight their referral program\u2014offering extra storage if you invite friends\u2014more prominently within the app UI. Skyrocketed referral-driven account signups, becoming a core viral loop for Dropbox\u2019s early growth. Simple, unobtrusive calls to action resulted in widespread brand advocacy at a very low cost. Became a legendary example of how product-led growth can hinge on a few well-placed nudges. Why It Matters: Accelerates user acquisition: Referral programs encourage organic word-of-mouth expansion with minimal marketing spend. Increases loyalty: Existing customers get a \u201cwin\u201d when they successfully refer friends or family. Validates trust: People are more likely to trust a bank recommended by someone they know, which can amplify your brand\u2019s reputation. Implementation Tips: Make sharing easy: a simple banner or button in the app that lets users send a unique referral link or code. Offer tangible incentives like cash rewards, waived fees or bonus interest for both parties. Offer a simple in-app invite (\u201cRefer a friend to open a checking account and you both get $XX\u201d). Make the referral prompt a friendly, unobtrusive banner on the homepage or in user settings. Dopamine Trigger: Social Validation and Reward: Getting a bonus for referring a friend\u2014and knowing the friend also benefits\u2014creates a win-win scenario that triggers dopamine both through social approval and the tangible reward (like cash or bonus points). Positive Anticipation: Waiting to see if the referral converts is itself a mini thrill, and receiving the reward spikes dopamine upon success. Emotional Effect: Users feel valued by the bank and take pride in sharing a good product with friends. The reward structure cements loyalty and fosters a community feeling. 7. Progress Bar Example: LinkedIn\u2019s Progress Bar for Profile Completion Adding a visual progress bar and step-by-step guidance encouraged users to complete their profiles or any other applications. More complete profiles led to better matches and increased recruiter engagement and user satisfaction. Significantly boosted LinkedIn\u2019s key metric: time spent on the platform and networking success. Set a precedent for gamified \u201conboarding journeys\u201d now found in countless apps and services. Why It Matters: Encourages thorough KYC: Seeing a profile progress bar can nudge users to verify their address, upload identification or add income details. Improves overall service: A fully updated profile unlocks faster loan decisions, personalized advice and lower compliance risk. Adds a gamification element: Users experience a sense of reward when reaching 100% completion, increasing the likelihood they\u2019ll continue exploring the app. Implementation Tips: Introduce a visual tracker that shows how much of the user\u2019s profile is complete (e.g., address, ID documents, phone verification, etc.). Provide incentives: \u201cComplete your profile to unlock faster loan approvals or instant transfers.\u201d Show clear benefits at each milestone: \u201cAdd your employer to boost credit limit possibilities.\u201d Use celebratory micro-animations or badges when users reach a new completion level. Dopamine Trigger: Gamification and Achievement: Each incremental fill in the progress bar is a mini-achievement, which can consistently trigger small amounts of dopamine as the user edges closer to 100%. Clear Goals and Feedback: The brain loves clear goals with visible feedback loops\u2014hitting them translates into tangible reward signals. Emotional Effect: Users feel rewarded and motivated to complete their profile (or KYC steps), associating the banking app with a sense of accomplishment rather than dread. 8. One-Tap Feedback Example: Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d Button (and Reactions) Initially, adding the simple \u201cLike\u201d button offered a low-effort way to acknowledge posts. Later, other reactions (e.g., love, angry, sad, etc.) were introduced for more nuanced engagement. \u201cLikes\u201d quickly became a core social metric, encouraging users to engage with content. Reactions gave Facebook deeper data on user preferences and emotional responses. The small tweak of going from zero to multiple \u201creactions\u201d changed the way users share feedback, spurring increased interaction. Why It Matters: Ensures continuous improvement: Quick feedback loop helps the bank measure customer satisfaction on-the-go \u201cthumbs up or down\u201d or a 1\u20135 star rating. Customer-centered culture: Creates a culture of continuous improvement, powered by data-driven insights on customer satisfaction. Builds customer trust: Users see the bank is genuinely interested in their experience, not just the transaction. Implementation Tips: After a chat or call with customer support, show a one-tap feedback mechanism (like a thumbs up or 1\u20135 stars). Provide optional expanded reactions for more nuanced feedback (e.g., \u201cfast response,\u201d \u201cfriendly agent,\u201d \u201cissue not resolved\u201d). Instant experience rate request with optional fields for more details: \u201cPlease tell us why\u201d if the user gives a low rating. Sum up feedback in dashboards to identify trends and training opportunities. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Sense of Contribution: Providing a quick reaction or rating triggers a small psychological reward, as the user feels \u201cheard\u201d by the service. Social Mechanism: Positive feedback loops\u2014like a quick \u201cthumbs up\u201d for a helpful chat\u2014mirror social media\u2019s reaction mechanisms, each delivering micro doses of dopamine for both the user and the service agent (if they see high ratings). Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and believe their feedback matters, building a stronger emotional connection and sense of loyalty to the institution. 9. Biometric One-Tap Payment Example: Apple iPhone\u2019s \u201cApple Pay\u201d One-Tap Checkout Apple seamlessly integrated \u201cApple Pay\u201d into the iPhone\u2019s core experience, allowing users to authorize payments with Face ID or Touch ID in just one tap. Eliminated friction: Removing the need to type credit card details or billing addresses significantly shortened the checkout flow. Boosted adoption: Partnerships with major retailers and apps helped \u201cApple Pay\u201d become a ubiquitous, go-to payment method. Strengthened ecosystem: The convenience factor kept users locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, reinforcing brand loyalty. Why It Matters: Frictionless transactions: One-tap or one-look authentication for financial transactions sets a new bar for quick, secure payments in banking apps. Increased user trust: Apple\u2019s strong privacy and security stance assures users that their sensitive data is protected. Future-proofing: As users grow accustomed to instant payments, banks that fail to offer similarly smooth experiences risk losing relevance. Implementation Tips: Biometric integration: Tie into the device\u2019s biometric security (Face ID, Touch ID) to reduce login friction and confirm transactions seamlessly. Enter Apple ecosystem: Present the Add Card to Apple Pay (or equivalent) button prominently in your app. Dopamine Trigger: Instant gratification: The speed and ease of paying with a tap or glance release small hits of dopamine associated with accomplishing tasks effortlessly. Security + convenience rush: Users get the dual reward of feeling both safe and efficient, reinforcing positive emotions. Emotional Effect: The marriage of security and speed makes users feel their bank is modern and protective, increasing emotional loyalty. 10. Recurring Personalized Discovery Example: Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d Personalized Playlists Spotify pioneered user-specific music recommendations with \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d a curated playlist updated each Monday. High engagement: Users often check the playlist regularly, boosting in-app listening time. Built habit loops: The anticipation of new, tailored songs each week fosters a loyal user base. Industry-defining: It became a blueprint for recommendation systems across music and media platforms. Why It Matters: Contextual insights: Banks can similarly offer spending insights or saving tips based on a customer\u2019s \u201cfinancial habits.\u201d Habit formation: Recurring personalized prompts (like monthly spending reviews) can keep users returning to the app. Deep user bonds: Showing you \u201cknow\u201d your customer\u2019s preferences builds trust and longer-term engagement. Implementation Tips: Weekly or monthly insights: Provide automated \u201cFinancial Snapshot\u201d playlists\u2014like recommended budgeting steps or relevant offers Data-driven personalization: Leverage machine learning on user transaction data to highlight products or services with the highest personal benefit. Easy discovery: Place these personalized recommendations front and center on the home screen or via push notifications. Dopamine Trigger: Novelty and surprise: Finding a new favorite song (or, in banking terms, discovering a new benefit) sparks a dopamine hit. Positive reinforcement: When suggestions prove helpful, users feel validated and look forward to more customized tips. Emotional Effect: Users feel recognized on an individual level, forging an emotional link with your brand. 11. Single-Tap Rides Example: Uber\u2019s One-Tap Ride Request Uber simplified ride-hailing to a single tap, automatically detecting location, matching a driver and processing payment in the background. Revolutionized convenience: Removing the need for phone calls, manual address entry or cash changed urban transport globally. Increased retention: Customers repeatedly chose Uber for the seamless experience over traditional cabs or slower competitor apps. Set user expectations: Ride-hailing is now synonymous with \u201ctap, ride, done.\u201d Why It Matters: Reduced friction = higher usage: In finance, simplifying complex tasks (like requesting a loan or splitting bills) can lead to more frequent user activity. Automation of details: Users appreciate not having to re-enter repeated data points, echoing the convenience of \u201cno-cash, no-hassle\u201d rides. Brand differentiation: A bank offering near-instant processes (e.g., quick loan approvals) stands out in a crowded market. Implementation Tips: Auto-fill data: For repeat transactions, pre-fill as many details as possible so users just confirm. Transparent process: Show real-time status updates (e.g., \u201cYour request is being processed,\u201d \u201cApproved in 10 seconds\u201d). Built-in payments: Keep the payment mechanism seamless within the app rather than redirecting to external portals. Dopamine Trigger: Immediate outcome: One-tap actions that instantly produce a tangible result (like calling a ride) reward the brain with a sense of competence. Predictability and control: Knowing exactly when the \u201ccar\u201d or result will arrive fosters calm satisfaction\u2014tiny dopamine bursts. Emotional Effect: Minimizing complexity helps users feel they\u2019re effortlessly in control of their finances, reducing stress. 12. Live Collaboration Canvas Example: Figma\u2019s Real-Time Collaboration Figma introduced live, multi-user editing in a design tool, allowing teams to collaborate in the same file simultaneously. Eliminated version chaos: No more \u201cv2-final-FINAL\u201d file versions. Everyone sees updates instantly. Supercharged productivity: Designers, developers and stakeholders communicate in one place, reducing the number of back-and-forth emails. Community effect: Shared templates and plug-in ecosystems flourished around real-time features, fueling word-of-mouth growth. Why It Matters: Transparent collaboration: In banking apps, real-time co-browsing with support agents or co-managing finances with family members can build trust. Instant updates: Shared budgeting tools or joint account management can show immediate changes, fostering teamwork. Modern user expectations: People now expect seamless, synchronized experiences\u2014bringing that to finance differentiates you from outdated, siloed systems. Implementation Tips: Multi-user features: Offer \u201cjoint account views\u201d in which spouses or business partners see real-time transaction updates and can add notes. Co-browsing support: Enable support reps to view a user\u2019s screen (with permission) to guide them through complex tasks. Notification system: Keep relevant stakeholders in the loop with instant push alerts or in-app updates on shared financial tasks. Dopamine Trigger: Synchronous collaboration joy: Seeing real-time input from others can be exciting and rewarding, sparking mini-dopamine boosts. Reduced friction in teamwork: A frictionless group experience fosters a positive emotional response and a sense of collective achievement. Emotional Effect: Shared ownership and trust provides real-time transparency to build trust among users and between users and the bank. Feeling \u201cin it together\u201d increases satisfaction. 13. Endless Personalized Feed Example: TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d Infinite Feed TikTok\u2019s vertical feed quickly personalized videos based on watch time, likes and replays, hooking users into continuous viewing. Hyper-engagement: The algorithm\u2019s accuracy and infinite scroll keep users scrolling far longer than they initially intend. Viral content engine: Easy video creation plus mass distribution turned TikTok into a cultural phenomenon. Redefined short-form media: The \u201cFor You Page\u201d is now the gold standard for endless, highly personalized entertainment. Why It Matters: Contextual curation: Banks can adopt similar \u201cinfinite\u201d but curated feed concepts\u2014like continuously updated financial insights. User stickiness: Engaging, snackable content (short tips, quick budgeting wins) can keep users returning daily. Behavioral data: By analyzing user interactions, the bank can refine future recommendations, from loyalty offers to credit advice. Implementation Tips: Short-form updates: Provide quick, scrollable financial tips or \u201cstories\u201d (e.g., daily spending insights, saving challenges). Personalized content feed: Prioritize recommendations based on each user\u2019s spending patterns, goals and previous interactions. Easy shareability: Let users quickly share these insights or achievements with friends, echoing TikTok\u2019s social \u201cduet\u201d effect. Dopamine Trigger: Endless novelty: Rapid-fire personalized content can trigger repeated dopamine surges as each new \u201ccard\u201d or insight might bring value. Micro-rewards: Even a small, useful tip or motivational nudge can feel rewarding, encouraging continued scrolling. Emotional Effect: Users feel a slight \u201cthrill\u201d in checking what will come up next, building habit loops around financial literacy. Presenting financial guidance in an engaging feed reduces intimidation and builds a positive, exploratory mindset. Final Thoughts While banks and Fintechs must navigate strict regulations and prioritize robust security, interface innovations needn\u2019t be complex to succeed. A single button, a strategic piece of microcopy or a well-placed progress bar can guide user behavior, inspire trust and drive meaningful business results. In a digital world in which consumers can switch providers with a few taps, thoughtful design enhancements are paramount. By adapting proven UX patterns from retail, media and tech to the specialized needs of finance, banks and Fintechs can surprise and delight customers, creating enduring loyalty. Even minor changes\u2014like shortening forms or enabling one-step transactions\u2014can reduce user effort and boost satisfaction. Clear, streamlined interfaces also reassure users that their finances are secure. Psychological nudges, such as progress bars, rewards or urgency indicators, can further influence positive user behavior while distinguishing forward-thinking institutions from those clinging to legacy systems. By weaving small, gratifying user experiences into every step of the banking journey, financial institutions can harness the power of dopamine to boost user satisfaction and build deeper loyalty\u2014all while helping customers manage their finances in a more streamlined, empowering way. Whether it\u2019s removing unnecessary steps, adding a single button or surfacing the right information at the right time, these micro-optimizations often become major growth levers\u2014proving that small, thoughtful design changes can have an outsized impact on both user behavior and business metrics. Minimize friction: Just like in e-commerce or media streaming, faster and simpler interactions increase conversion and satisfaction in banking. Use microcopy and visual cues: Subtle text prompts, progress bars and well-chosen animations reassure users about the seriousness and security of financial actions. Personalization matters: Deliver the right suggestions at the right time\u2014be it a savings prompt or a referral link\u2014to dramatically increase uptake of financial services. Build trust: In finance, trust is paramount. High-quality visuals, clear confirmations and frictionless onboarding reinforce user confidence. Balance and Transparency: Overusing urgency tactics or \u201cdark patterns\u201d can erode trust. Ethical design focuses on helpful nudges rather than manipulative tricks. Sustainable Engagement: Dopamine-driven design should improve financial wellness and user satisfaction, not pushing impulsive actions. Long-Term Loyalty: Positive \u201cmicro-rewards\u201d around money management encourage recurring, long-term usage of your platform.

The goal is to manufacture an apparent public \u201cconsensus\u201d for more migration, according to Lopez: coordinated [PR] content creates a sense of consensus \u2014 giving people a familiar framework to fall back on when forming opinions. Repetition isn\u2019t noise; it\u2019s how narratives take hold. \u2026 A well-informed public that sees immigrants as neighbors, workers, and contributors is essential for democracy itself. A public misled by fear will support mass deportations, surveillance, and state-sponsored cruelty \u2014 especially when they\u2019re presented as the only available options. \u2026 Pro-immigrant forces will succeed if they offer an alternative vision of a modern immigration system centered on citizenship and safety that empowers working families and fuels democracy. The article promoted a free video where a veteran criticized Trump\u2019s pro-American policy, saying, \u201chis immigration polices are immoral \u2026 it goes against all the values that I learned in the military.\u201d \u201cThe real issue isn\u2019t policy; it\u2019s communication,\u201d Lopez said in a March 6 post against national solidarity.\u201dIt\u2019s time to go on offense, flood the zone, and make the case for a country that works for all of us.\u201d In reality, the federal government uses a ruthless economic policy of Extraction Migration to grow Wall Street \u2014 and Powell Jobs\u2019 stock wealth \u2014 by importing more consumers, renters, and workers from developing countries, regardless of the massive pocketbook and civic damage to ordinary Americans and the migrants\u2019 own countries. For example, under President Joe Biden\u2019s high-migration policies, 300 million blue-collar and white-collar Americans lost wealth in the labor and housing markets, and the workplace investment, productivity, and training once enabled by employers. Many college graduates also lost career opportunities as his deputies expanded the inflow of white-collar workers, such as H-1B visa workers . FLASHBACK: 1,500 Migrants Surge Across Border into Texas in Six Hours Citizens also lost civic stability to government-imposed social diversity , and hey l cal power to the expanding blocs of ethnic voters who continue to demand more benefits for their imported communities, cultures, and home countries. Americans have also grown disgusted at their government\u2019s migration policy because it used billions of their dollars to extract human resources from poor countries for use in the U.S. economy- while also causing thousands of deaths among migrants and Americans , plus massive civic damage to the sending countries . Many polls show Americans\u2019 growing opposition to migration amid expensive propaganda from Powell Jobs and other billionaires. In February, Lopez used her CatalyzeUS Substack post to claim that Powell Jobs\u2019 pro-migration message is being overpowered by Trump\u2019s pro-enforcement messages. The best message in the world is useless if no one hears it. Republicans understand this , which is why they aren\u2019t just repeating anti-immigrant lies\u2014they\u2019re saturating every platform, every news cycle, and every medium to ensure no other narrative breaks through. Their propaganda isn\u2019t winning on merit; it\u2019s filling a void left by Democratic silence . While the right floods the airwaves with fearmongering, Democrats act as if polling alone will save them, assuming facts will speak for themselves. But facts don\u2019t win battles\u2014feelings do . Yet her pro-migration side has far more lobbyists on the payroll, more friendly media coverage, and far more elite support. For example, Powell Jobs uses her multi-billion inheritance from Apple founder Steve Jobs to push for more economic migration that transfers ordinary Americans\u2019 wages to wealthy investors. Similarly, billionaire Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Pos t, and its migration coverage almost entirely ignores the economic and civic damage done by American communities by Biden\u2019s illegal and legal migrants, such as H-1B workers. Mark Zuckerberg and a truckload of other billionaires helped created the FWD.us lobbying group, which played a huge role in the Biden administration. After the election, its top officials blamed poor messaging for the public\u2019s reaction to the wealth-shifting inflow of roughly 14 million legal and illegal migrants. \u201cThis election was about rebuking the fact that Biden governed on this issue very poorly, and people did not like what they saw, and they were not hearing a coherent policy or messaging answer on what was coming next,\u201d Andrea Flores, the Vice President of Immigration Policy & Campaigns at FWD.us, said in December. Extraction Migration also does huge damage to migrants, but their suffering is ignored by the establishment media when it cannot be used to sway U.S. politics .

Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. WASHINGTON: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining The Market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

By Sankalp Phartiyal, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:45 IST Photo Credit: Apple iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now Highlights The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn's factory Apple will increasingly prioritise iPhones from India for US Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India Advertisement Apple assembled $22 billion (roughly Rs. 1,89,412 crore) worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months ended March, increasing production by nearly 60 percent over the previous year in a sign of continued diversification away from China. The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now makes 20 percent, or one in five, of its prized iPhones in the South Asian country, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information isn't public. The dollar figure represents the devices' estimated factory gate value, rather than the marked-up retail price. The ramp-up suggests the iPhone maker and its suppliers are accelerating a pivot to India from China, a process it began when harsh Covid lockdowns hurt production at Apple's largest plant. The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn Technology Group's factory in southern India. Tata Group's electronics manufacturing arm, which bought Wistron Corp. and controls Pegatron Corp.'s operations, is also a key supplier. Apple, Nvidia Score Relief From US Tariffs With Exemptions Apple did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Of the total India production, Apple exported 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.4 billion) in iPhones from the region in the fiscal year through March 2025, the nation's technology minister said on April 8. Shipments of iPhones from India to the US accelerated after President Donald Trump announced his plans for the so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs in February, the people said. Apple's average India production and exports surged all through the fiscal year to March. Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be in Development With This Notable Upgrade Apple will increasingly prioritize iPhones from the India supply chain for its US customers, Bloomberg News reported previously. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronics goods including smartphones and computers from its reciprocal tariffs. That's good news for companies such as Apple and Nvidia , though the reprieve doesn't appear to extend to Trump's separate 20 percent duty on China, applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl. This also means iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now. Barring the exceptions made Friday, Trump's cumulative levies on China remain at 145 percent and will likely force companies such as Apple to intensify their supply chain shift. But with nearly 200 suppliers and an overwhelming reliance on China, moves to other countries could take years to play out. Despite Trump's ambition to have iPhones made in the US, Apple is unlikely to move production there any time soon due to factors including a shortage of facilities and labor needed to produce the devices. Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has often praised China's high-level of skill in making its marquee devices. In 2022, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated it would take eight years to move just 10 percent of Apple's production capacity out of China. Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India, including the more expensive titanium Pro models . Its manufacturing success in the world's most populous nation is also helped by state subsidies tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to turn the country into a manufacturing hub. Modi is also seeking to widen electronics component manufacturing with $2.7 billion (roughly Rs. 23,246 crore) in new financial incentives, and is focused on advancing its semiconductor ambitions. Apple has a nearly eight percent market share in India's smartphone market, where its sales \u2014 a bulk of those from iPhones \u2014 reached almost $8 billion (roughly Rs. 68,877 crore) in fiscal 2024. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Japan's Nikkei rises as iPhone-related stocks jump \"The market is still swayed by various headlines,\" said Yugo Tsuboi, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. By Reuters Updated - April 14, 2025 at 01:15 PM. File photo: A screen displays the Nikkei 225 Stock Average outside a securities firm in Tokyo, Japan. | Photo Credit: Shoko Takayasu Japan's Nikkei share average ended higher on Monday, as iPhone-related shares jumped after the United States excluded smartphones and other electronics from steep tariffs . The Nikkei gained 1.18 per cent to close at 33,982.36, after gaining as much as 2.22 per cent earlier in the session. The broader Topix rose 0.88 per cent to end at 2,488.51. \"The market is still swayed by various headlines,\" said Yugo Tsuboi, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. \"And none of them are good enough to encourage investors to take their positions confidently.\" U.S. President Donald Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China, providing a big break to tech firms like Apple that rely on imported products. However, both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed in a month or so. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China Trump had announced hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries on April 2, triggering a market rout, but reversed them with a 90-day freeze shortly after they went into effect. A 10 per cent blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports remains in effect. The Nikkei has declined 5 per cent since what Trump called \"Liberation Day\", after posting huge swings last week. The sudden moves underscored investor anxieties as they tried to gauge the fallout from the U.S. trade policy. Still, shares of i Phone suppliers rose on Monday, with Murata Manufacturing gaining 1.65 per cent. TDK jumped 4.27 per cent and Taiyo Yuden surged 6 per cent. Chip-testing equipment maker Advantest jumped 4.92 per cent to provide the biggest boost to the Nikkei. Of more than 1,600 stocks trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's prime market, 80 per cent rose, 16 per cent fell, while 2 per cent traded flat.

It has the same flat sides, heft in the hand, and speaker grilles that Pac-Man would gobble up as the M1 monster that brought desktop-class chips to tablets, but instead sports an M3. The extra processing grunt means apps like Affinity Photo and the iPad versions of Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve absolutely fly, and the Apple Pencil Pro makes it ideal for sketching too. There's a keyboard case that turns it into a kind of laptop, and the USB-C port means there's no scrabbling around for a compatible charger. It\u2019s not cheap, but with its surprisingly reasonable starting price (though you're going to want to upgrade the base specs, which gets expensive fast), this might be the best tablet for creative s right now \u2013 and it's certainly winging its way to the best iPad for drawing guide. Key specifications (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) Swipe to scroll horizontally CPU: Apple M3 NPU: 16-core Neural Engine Graphics: Integrated, nine cores Memory: 8GB Storage: 128GB - 1TB Screen size: 11 or 13in (version tested) Screen type: LED-backlit IPS touchscreen Resolution: 2,732 x 2,048 (version tested) Refresh rate: 60Hz Colour gamut (claimed): P3 wide colour Brightness (claimed): 600 nits Ports: 1x USB-C (10Gbps) Wireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G eSIM (optional) Dimensions: 281 x 215 x 6mm (13in model) Weight: 616 grams (version tested) Design, build and display (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) Apple makes great tablets. There's no need to say anything else. The 2025 edition of the iPad Air retains the design of the 2024 model, with flat sides and rounded corners. The back has lost the \u2018iPad\u2019 wordmark but the Apple logo remains, and there's a single camera lens to mark the Air out from the better-endowed Pro, but they share the three-dot connector for the Magic Keyboard on the back. Apple iPad Air M3 13 (White) at Currys for \u00a3299 It\u2019s a very restrained design, with all the attention focused instead on the screen. As your main way of interacting with a tablet, this is to be expected, and the rest of the iPAd fades into the background when you\u2019re engrossed in the display. The edges of the iPad Air are broken by the little plastic sections that denote the points at which antennas pass through the metal to get a better signal, and there are four speakers split between top and bottom. The USB-C port sits where you\u2019d expect it to, and there are the usual volume rocker and lock buttons too, the latter doubling as a fingerprint reader. You may like Apple somehow managed to make the iPad line up even stranger The best iPad for graphic design The 12in iPad Air is lighter than a laptop but heavier than some other tablets - though it is quite large, which immediately means it will weigh more, and will require a bag that can fit a thin and light laptop to carry with you. Apple doesn\u2019t say what the glass covering the touchscreen is, but the entire build feels stiff and assured in the hand, though there's no IP rating, so it might be best to keep it dry and clean. \u2022 Sturdy design \u2022 Nothing new Design score: 4/5 Features (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) Most of the iPad Air\u2019s features are software-based, as the tablet itself is bare apart from a single USB-C port that\u2019s not a Thunderbolt. It doesn\u2019t have Face ID for unlocking, relying instead on Touch ID through the lock button, and there's only a single wide-angle camera lens on the back. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, however. All of these things are perfectly acceptable on a tablet - the USB-C port still does video out, and 10Gbps is fast enough for all but the highest resolution images and video files. Using a tablet to take photos is a sub-optimal experience at best, and so extra tele and ultrawide lenses will be largely redundant. The iPad Air is compatible with Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard and both types of Apple Pencil - the Pro model introduces a new twist sensor and a squeeze gesture to make quick changes, as well as having customisable haptic feedback, but costs \u00a350 more. The Magic Keyboard sports a trackpad so it\u2019s possible to use the iPad more like a laptop, and iPadOS has features like Stage Manager to make use of external monitors. The OS itself has improved since it split from iOS . Apple Intelligence is now built in, and of course you get Siri voice control and iCloud for your documents. It still feels like working on an oversized phone rather than a desktop OS, however, which may put some off, but if you\u2019re prepared to operate within its constraints it can do almost anything a laptop can. \u2022 OS improvements \u2022 Only one USB port Feature score: 3/5 Benchmark scores Swipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Header Cell - Column 1 Apple iPad Air M3 GEEKBENCH 6 CPU Single-core: 3029 Row 1 - Cell 0 CPU Multi-core: 11888 Row 2 - Cell 0 GPU Metal: 46023 3D Mark Steel Nomad Light: 2623, 19.4fps Row 4 - Cell 0 Wild Life Extreme: 5638, 33.8fps Row 5 - Cell 0 Solar Bay: 9594, 36.5 fps Performance (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) The M3 was an excellent chip when we first reviewed it in a MacBook Air back in 2024, and it remains so now. The iPad Pro may have made the leap up to M4, but it also costs twice as much. In 3D Mark\u2019s Steel Nomad, a graphics test for high-end mobile devices that scales its 1440p action to the native screen resolution and looks like a modern console game, the M3 Air managed a sliver under 20 FPS, which is just about a playable framerate but not exactly smooth - if scores can be compared across platforms, then the M3 iPad does worse than a PC with a GeForce GTX 1650 card in it. The same is true in Wild Life Extreme, a 4K benchmark that is considered too heavy for most phones and tablets, so the Air is doing well to get 33 FPS on average. In the Geekbench tests, the Air\u2019s score in the multi-core benchmark is just slightly below that of an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, a 12-core desktop processor from 2020. That\u2019s an excellent result for a tablet. As a better comparison, an M1 version of the iPad Pro we had laying around the office scored 3,000 points less than the M3 iPad Air in the multi-core CPU test, a difference of almost 30%. So we\u2019re looking at an excellent processor, that\u2019s slightly weak in the GPU area but no more than most chips that use integrated graphics. The problem with iPadOS for creatives is the software: you\u2019ve got versions (with missing features) of Photoshop , Lightroom and Illustrator, plus the full Affinity suite, DaVinci Resolve, Procreate, Sketchup, Nomad Sculpt, Pixelmator Pro and more, along with GarageBand and Logic Pro. If those are good enough for you, or you\u2019re prepared to learn something new, then Apple has made a productivity powerhouse. If not, then a traditional laptop may be more appealing. Battery life is tricky to evaluate on a tablet, as none of the standardised tests we usually use are available, but Apple claims 10 hours of endurance out of a charge, and that feels a little high but not too far off the mark. It will last all day, but the battery life is down compared to the M1 and M2 models. \u2022 Desktop-class performance \u2022 Software limitations Performance score: 5/5 Price (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) The iPad Air base price is deceptive. \u00a3799 for the 13in sounds like a good deal for a tablet of this quality, but once you\u2019ve added the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard it\u2019s suddenly \u00a31,098. Then as you upgrade the storage, the price climbs even higher. You could buy the base model 13in MacBook Air M4 for \u00a3999, and have more RAM, twice the storage, and \u00a3100 back in your pocket, though the laptop doesn\u2019t come with a touchscreen. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra costs a lot more. It means that the iPad can be a tricky recommendation - they make truly excellent creative machines, but the price can be somewhat daunting. Value score: 3/5 Who is it for? \u2022 Creatives and students The iPad Air is hugely versatile, able to be used for sketching as well as word processing and everything in between. Having just one USB port is a definite limitation, so you will need a hub if you\u2019re doing serious work on it, but the possibilities are endless. With a desktop-class CPU at its heart, you\u2019ll never feel slowed down, and with excellent battery life the Air is a great choice for a main or backup machine.

This time-oriented approach emphasizes intentional planning and aligning tasks with your available time, helping you reduce stress and streamline your workflow. By integrating tools like calendars, task managers, and notes apps, the system avoids unnecessary complexity while promoting simplicity and clarity. Here\u2019s how you can adopt this method to enhance your productivity and maintain better control over your responsibilities. Imagine starting your week with a clear plan, knowing exactly what needs your attention and when. No more endless lists or last-minute scrambling\u2014just a focused, intentional way to tackle your responsibilities. The Time Sector System is designed to help you do just that by aligning your tasks with your available time, so you can prioritize what truly matters without overloading yourself. Whether you\u2019re managing work deadlines, personal errands, or long-term goals, this system offers a practical solution to streamline your workflow and create a sense of calm amidst the busyness. TL;DR Key Takeaways : The Time Sector System focuses on managing tasks based on when they need to be done, prioritizing timeframes like \u201cthis week\u201d or \u201cnext week\u201d to reduce overwhelm and improve focus. It emphasizes intentional weekly planning, aligning tasks with calendar commitments and available time to create a realistic and achievable workload. Effective use of tools is key: notes apps for storing project materials, task managers for actionable tasks, and calendars for deadlines and time-specific commitments. Streamlining work and personal tasks into a unified system simplifies workflows, while periodic reviews of long-term tasks help maintain a clutter-free and efficient system. Email tasks are managed by categorizing quick actions and complex tasks separately, while collaborative tools and selective use of deadlines ensure clarity and reduce complexity. Prioritizing Tasks by Time The core principle of the Time Sector System is categorizing tasks based on timeframes, such as \u201cthis week,\u201d \u201cnext week,\u201d or \u201clong-term.\u201d This time-focused structure shifts your attention from overwhelming to-do lists to manageable priorities. By concentrating on what needs to be done within a specific period, you can avoid the stress of juggling too many tasks simultaneously and focus on what truly matters. A critical practice in this system is intentional weekly planning. At the start of each week, you manually assign tasks to the \u201cthis week\u201d category. This ensures your workload aligns with your calendar commitments and available time. By doing so, you prevent overloading your schedule and set yourself up for achievable, focused progress. This deliberate planning process helps you stay proactive rather than reactive, giving you a clear sense of direction for the week ahead. Choosing the Right Tools To implement the Time Sector System effectively, it\u2019s essential to use the right tools in distinct but complementary ways. Each tool plays a specific role in maintaining an organized and efficient workflow: Notes Apps: Use these to store project-related materials, such as emails, documents, and links. Keeping all relevant information in one place ensures it\u2019s easily accessible when you\u2019re working on a task, reducing the time spent searching for resources. Task Managers: Assign actionable tasks to your task manager, linking them to project notes if necessary. This keeps your task list focused, prevents it from becoming overwhelming, and ensures that every task has a clear purpose and context. Calendars: Reserve your calendar for deadlines and time-specific commitments. Treat it as a \u201csacred space\u201d to maintain a clear and uncluttered view of your schedule, making sure that you can easily visualize your time commitments without distractions. By clearly defining the role of each tool, you create a cohesive system that minimizes confusion, eliminates redundancy, and maximizes efficiency. This structured approach ensures that your tools work together seamlessly, supporting your productivity rather than complicating it.

A unified approach simplifies your workflow, reduces the risk of overlooking important responsibilities, and ensures that all aspects of your life are accounted for in one place. However, if your workplace enforces specific policies regarding task management tools, you may need to maintain separate systems for work and personal tasks. In such cases, ensure both systems are easy to manage and do not create unnecessary complexity. Consistency in how you organize and prioritize tasks across systems will help you maintain clarity and avoid confusion. Handling Email Tasks Effectively Emails often contain actionable items, but without a proper system, they can quickly become overwhelming. The Time Sector System offers a straightforward way to manage email-related tasks: Quick Actions: For tasks that require minimal effort, such as brief replies, use an \u201caction this day\u201d email folder to keep them organized and easily accessible. This ensures that small tasks don\u2019t get lost in your inbox. Complex Tasks: For tasks that require more time or effort, transfer them to your task manager. This allows you to prioritize them alongside your other responsibilities and ensures they are addressed in a timely manner. This approach prevents your inbox from becoming a chaotic to-do list and helps you stay on top of email-related tasks. By separating quick actions from more complex tasks, you can manage your email workload more effectively and maintain a clear focus on your priorities. Reviewing Long-Term Tasks Over time, long-term and on-hold tasks can accumulate, creating unnecessary clutter in your system. To maintain a streamlined workflow, schedule periodic reviews\u2014such as quarterly check-ins\u2014to evaluate these tasks. During these reviews, remove items that are no longer relevant and focus on maintaining a manageable list of long-term priorities. Regular reviews ensure that your system remains effective, up-to-date, and aligned with your current goals. This practice also helps you identify opportunities to move long-term tasks into actionable categories, keeping your progress steady and intentional. Collaborating on Shared Tasks For shared responsibilities, such as team projects or household tasks, collaborative tools like Apple Reminders or Microsoft To Do can be highly effective. These apps allow multiple users to update and manage lists in real time, reducing miscommunication and fostering seamless collaboration. By using shared tools, you can ensure that everyone involved has access to the same information and can contribute to the task\u2019s progress. This approach not only improves efficiency but also strengthens accountability within teams or households. Managing Deadlines and Task Dates Deadlines are best managed within your calendar, where they can be visualized alongside other time-specific commitments. Avoid assigning deadlines to tasks in your task manager unless absolutely necessary, as this can create unnecessary complexity and anxiety. Similarly, only assign dates to tasks when they are tied to specific deadlines or review points. This selective approach keeps your system simple, focused, and free from clutter. By reserving your calendar for critical deadlines and commitments, you can maintain a clear overview of your time and avoid overloading your schedule. Gaining Clarity and Control The Time Sector System enables you to take control of your tasks by aligning them with your available time and priorities. Through intentional planning, the strategic use of tools, and a streamlined workflow, you can reduce anxiety, improve efficiency, and maintain a sense of clarity. By adopting this system, you\u2019ll not only stay organized but also gain the confidence to manage your responsibilities effectively. This method offers a practical and sustainable way to balance your workload, making sure that you can focus on what truly matters while staying in control of your time.

By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

Priced at $999, it offers a compelling balance of performance and value, making it an attractive option for a wide range of users. While its design remains familiar, the M4 introduces enhancements that cater to modern needs and elevate the overall user experience. Below is a detailed video from Created Tech of its design, features, performance, and value. Watch this video on YouTube . Design and Key Features The M4 MacBook Air retains the slim, lightweight design introduced with the M2 redesign in 2022, emphasizing portability and elegance. While the overall aesthetic remains consistent, Apple has refreshed the lineup with a new sky-blue color, replacing the space gray option. This subtle yet modern update adds a fresh touch to the minimalist design. Key features of the M4 MacBook Air include: Center Stage Webcam: The upgraded webcam incorporates Center Stage technology, which intelligently adjusts to keep you centered during video calls. This feature enhances the experience for remote work, virtual meetings, and online collaboration. Dual External Monitor Support: Unlike its predecessors, the M4 supports two external monitors without requiring the laptop screen to be closed. This improvement significantly boosts multitasking capabilities and productivity for users managing multiple workflows. These refinements, while not new, enhance usability and align with the demands of modern users, making the M4 a practical choice for both personal and professional use. Performance: Incremental but Meaningful Upgrades The M4 chip introduces modest yet impactful improvements in both CPU and GPU performance. While the differences may not be immediately noticeable for everyday tasks, the M4 includes hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a feature that benefits users engaged in gaming, 3D modeling, or other graphics-intensive workflows. This enhancement enables smoother rendering and more realistic visuals, elevating the device\u2019s capabilities for creative professionals. Additional performance upgrades include: 16 GB Base RAM: The M4 doubles the base RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB, making sure smoother multitasking and better performance with resource-intensive applications. This upgrade also future-proofs the device for evolving software requirements. Faster SSD Speeds: Improved read and write speeds result in quicker file transfers, faster app loading times, and an overall more responsive user experience. For routine activities such as web browsing, media consumption, and document editing, the performance differences between the M1, M2, M3, and M4 are relatively minor. However, the M4\u2019s enhancements make it a more versatile and reliable option for users seeking longevity and adaptability in their devices. Battery Life and Thermal Performance The M4 chip brings a slight improvement in battery efficiency, offering an additional hour or two of usage compared to earlier models. While this increase may not be dramatic, it provides added convenience for users who rely on their laptops for extended periods without access to a power source. Thermal performance remains consistent with previous Apple Silicon MacBook Air models. The passive cooling system effectively manages heat during typical workloads, making sure silent operation. Even under heavy use, the M4 maintains comparable heat levels to its predecessors, with no significant thermal throttling observed. This consistency reinforces the MacBook Air\u2019s reputation for reliability and comfort during prolonged use. Pricing and Value Proposition At $999, the M4 MacBook Air redefines affordability within Apple\u2019s laptop lineup. The inclusion of 16 GB base RAM, faster SSD speeds, and other upgrades makes it a strong contender for users seeking a cost-effective yet capable device. In comparison, the M2 and M3 models launched at higher price points and offered fewer features, making the M4 a more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. For those considering older models, the M1, M2, and M3 remain viable choices, particularly when purchased secondhand at discounted prices. However, these models are best suited for basic tasks and should ideally include 16 GB of RAM to handle modern software demands effectively. The M4, with its enhanced specifications, offers better long-term value and versatility for a broader range of use cases. Who Should Buy the M4 MacBook Air? The M4 MacBook Air is an excellent choice for users seeking a well-rounded laptop that balances price, performance, and features. Its upgrades, such as the 16 GB base RAM, faster SSD, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing, make it suitable for casual users, students, and professionals with moderate computing needs. For those with more demanding workflows, such as video editing, software development, or advanced 3D rendering, a MacBook Pro may be a better fit due to its higher performance capabilities. However, for most users, the M4 MacBook Air offers a versatile and future-proof solution that meets a wide range of requirements. The M4 MacBook Air stands out as a practical and affordable option in Apple\u2019s lineup, delivering meaningful improvements that enhance the user experience without compromising on design or reliability. Whether you\u2019re upgrading from an older model or purchasing your first MacBook, the M4 offers a compelling combination of performance, features, and value.

Samsung slams the brakes on One UI 7 for Galaxy S24 and Z Fold 6 - PhoneArena Google Pixel 9 is discounted here! Home News You are here Shocker! Samsung slams the brakes on One UI 7 for Galaxy S24 and Z Fold 6 By Iskra Petrova Published: Apr 14, 2025, 2:29 AM 4 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Galaxy S Series Up Next: It appears Samsung has halted the One UI 7 push for Galaxy S24 phones. After months and months of delays and plenty of annoyance to Samsung fans, Samsung finally started releasing its Android 15 -based One UI 7 to supported phones, including the Galaxy S24 series. Now, however, Galaxy S24 series owners may be in for a shock, at least in Europe and Korea... as it seems the One UI 7 update has been pulled off the air . The One UI 7 update for the Galaxy S24 Ultra is still online on Samsung's servers, but the update for the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus appears to be gone. In the meantime, reputable tipster IceUniverse has chimed in with what could be the potential reason for the One UI 7 update to be removed from Samsung's servers. The tipster claims that an unexpected bug that is causing some Galaxy devices to not be able to be unlocked normally has made Samsung take dramatic measures. IceUniverse says the bug was found during the update in Korea and its discovery has reportedly halted the push of the update globally. According to the tipster, the bug with unlocking the phone doesn't occur in all cases, but apparently, it occurs enough for Samsung to slam the breaks.

The Galaxy S24 phones were on One UI 7 's beta program for months, and initially, One UI 7 was delayed, despite the Galaxy S25 series arriving with the new software out of the box. It is not known at this time how quickly Samsung will resolve the bug on the S24 series. It also seems the One UI 7 update has also been removed for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 : it's not clear if the same bug is responsible for that, but it's quite likely. This is frankly somewhat of a huge blunder given how long Galaxy S24 and other phone owners have been waiting to get a taste of Android 15 . An unlocking bug seems a pretty big deal though, as if you can't unlock your phone, you basically can't do anything with it. It seems to be the year of software struggle, at least for the big players on the market: Samsung and Apple. Apple has not had real delays with iOS versions, but it's failed to provide the promised Siri features to iPhone users , which is a pretty big deal . Nonetheless, I do hope the situation gets fixed quickly for Samsung so S24 owners can enjoy the new software sooner rather than later. Did you enjoy reading this article?

In 2025, its parent company, Alphabet, is a vast multinational technology conglomerate and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. While much of Alphabet\u2019s growth was internal, it also added to its empire through shrewd acquisitions, including of Android, DoubleClick and YouTube. Since 1998, it has acquired at least 267 companies . Alphabet is a key player in many digital markets, including general search, browsers, online advertising, mobile operating systems and intermediation. Google Search, for example, is now the most widely used general search engine in the world. Globally, its market share has been at least 78% for the past 10 years . Unsurprisingly, antitrust agencies, whose task is to protect competition, have been taking a close look at Google\u2019s conduct and that of other tech giants. While having market power is not illegal if it is the result of a superior product, protecting such a position by means that are not meritorious is. A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers. It provides an introduction to the diversity of research coming out of the continent and considers some of the key issues facing European countries. Get the newsletter! Google\u2019s conduct under scrutiny In recent years, there has been growing concern that Google may be using anticompetitive means to protect and extend dominant positions in core digital markets. In 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , the European Commission fined Google over \u20ac8 billion for abusing dominant positions in key markets \u2013 more than any other Big Tech company to date. A fourth investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the advertising technology market , in which the European Commission is likely to request structural changes to Google\u2019s advertising business, is nearing completion. The national competition agencies of the EU member states have also actively enforced EU and national abuse-of-dominance rules. Private antitrust class actions for damages are adding to Google\u2019s woes. In 2022, the EU enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to create an additional tool for intervening against entrenched market power in core platform markets. The DMA regulates the behaviour of so-called gatekeeper companies, aiming to make markets more contestable for competitors and fairer for users. In September 2023, the European Commission designated Alphabet as a gatekeeper in no fewer than eight platform markets for the following services: Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Google Ads, Chrome, YouTube and Google Android. Within days of the DMA\u2019s conduct rules becoming binding on Alphabet in March 2024, the European Commission opened the first noncompliance investigation to assess whether Google Search was continuing to treat Alphabet\u2019s own services more favourably than its rivals\u2019, and whether Google Play prevented app developers from steering consumers to other channels for better offers. For the Trump administration, EU rules amount to non-tariff restrictions The territorial scope of these rules is limited to services offered in Europe. They do not regulate how Google operates in the United States \u2013 this is subject to US antitrust law. Nonetheless, the European Commission\u2019s enforcement actions have provoked the ire of the current US administration. In February 2025, the White House issued a memorandum titled \u201cDefending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties\u201d that takes issue with European antitrust and regulatory measures against US companies. According to the Trump administration, the EU\u2019s rules amount to non-tariff restrictions and unfair exploitation of US companies, and they interfere with American sovereignty. The memorandum stresses that Washington will not hesitate to impose tariffs and other actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States. According to the European Union, such actions would amount to economic coercion and interfere with its legislative sovereignty to decide under what conditions services are offered on European soil. In 2022, likely with the possibility of a second Trump presidency in mind, it enacted the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument , which allows the European Commission to impose a wide range of \u201cresponse measures\u201d, including tariffs and restrictions on imports, exports, intellectual property rights, foreign direct investment, and access to public procurement. Such response measures could be imposed on US digital services. Potential for escalation The situation has the potential to further escalate the risk of a trade war between Europe and the United States. However, the dispute over tech regulation does not appear to be about substantive antitrust principles per se. In 2020, the US House of Representatives issued a bipartisan report stressing the need for the United States to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice subsequently brought antitrust lawsuits against all four companies, most of which are still pending. The Department of Justice filed two separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020 and in 2023 . In the first case, a Washington DC district court in August 2024 found Google guilty of violating section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and established that Google had attempted to protect its monopoly power in the market for general search through anticompetitive means. Judge Amit P. Mehta is now determining appropriate remedies, and the Department of Justice recently reiterated its request that the judge break up Google . The second US case against Google is still pending. The accusations in it are similar to those underlying the European Commission\u2019s ongoing investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the market for advertising technology. While the case was initiated during the Biden administration, it has not (yet) been shut down since Trump returned to power. It\u2019s also worth noting that the new head of the Federal Trade Commission has stressed that Big Tech is a main priority of his agency . There seems to be concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Google has been restricting competition. The crux of the discord, most likely, is that European regulators are telling US companies what to do \u2013 even if on European territory. Europe lacks equivalents to Big Tech The European Commission appears determined to keep enforcing its antitrust rules and the DMA. On March 19, 2025, it informed Alphabet that its preliminary assessment had shown that Google\u2019s behaviour in search and in the Google Play Store was incompatible with the DMA. Also, the first noncompliance decisions against Apple and Meta under the DMA are expected shortly \u2013 even though the fines may well stay below the maximum 10% of a company\u2019s global annual turnover allowed by the act, in view of its novelty. Europe is not an insignificant market for Google and other US tech companies. In 2024, Google reportedly generated 29% of its global revenue, or $100 billion , in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Europe has no equivalents to Google or other Big Tech companies, and the EU today imports 80% of its digital technology . In September 2024, the Draghi Report issued a stark warning to bloc leaders, highlighting waning geopolitical stability and the need for Europe to focus on closing the innovation gap with the US and China in advanced technologies. Less than five months later, the European Commission published the Competitiveness Compass , a roadmap to restoring Europe\u2019s dynamism and boosting economic growth. Strong measures from the White House in retaliation for European antitrust and regulatory enforcement might just give this process additional impetus. President Trump cannot make European tech great again, because it never was great. But his policies may unintentionally help make it so.

Industry Events 2025 Our directory of industry events SHOP Ex-Max, Hulu acquisitions exec Jonathan Melber named head of global licensing at Apple TV+ Apple TV+\u2019s recent original The Studio Apple TV+ has appointed former Hulu and Max acquisitions executive Jonathan Melber as its head of global licensing. California-based Melber has served as a consultant to the tech giant\u2019s streaming platform since September 2023. Until now, Apple TV+\u2019s content library has almost entirely comprised its own original projects, though speculation began to ramp up last year that the streamer was looking to bring more acquired third-party content on to the service to complement its originals, bulk up its overall offering and expand its subscriber base. In November, the company began looking for a head of global licensing. According to the job listing, the Culver City-based position is responsible for leading negotiations to acquire content both exclusively and non-exclusively across multiple regions, including North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. The position also involves ensuring regulatory compliance in all of the global territories where Apple TV+ operates. Melber was previously senior VP of content acquisition at HBO Max, until 2022. Before that, he was VP of content monetisation at Turner Networks and also worked in Hulu\u2019s content acquisition department.

With ambitions at hand, Apple is aiming to win the AR race against Meta, as it is a solid contender in the market that designs products with general use cases. Tim Cook is also set to beat Meta in \"industry-leading\" AR glasses, which would expand the company's AR product line. Tim Cook is set to beat Meta in the smart glasses race, but the true AR glasses will take time to be perfected A new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that Apple CEO Tim Cook \"cares about nothing else,\" according to an Apple engineer. However, building AR glasses might take a lot of time, even for a tech giant like Apple. Gurman claims that Apple is working on its own rendition of the smart glasses with AR capabilities, which will be pretty similar to the Meta Ray-Bans, housing cameras, and sensors. While the work is in progress, AR glasses are Tim Cook's \"top priority\" at this stage, indicating that we might see the wearable sooner than expected. Related Story Apple Takes Global Smartphone Crown In Q1 For The First Time, Thanks To iPhone 16e\u2019s Affordable Price And Mass Appeal That Helped It Outsell Every Other Brand Apple will utilize its Apple Intelligence branch, which will ultimately make the AR glasses a lot more useful than Meta's rendition. However, Apple Intelligence still has time to keep up with the industry, as the company has previously delayed one of the major Personalized Siri features until next year. While the delay was announced officially, we have also heard that the company is ramping up the development of the delayed features, which might be available in the fall of this year. The AR glasses from Apple will be built around Siri and its deeper integration with AI, but the company does have privacy concerns, as the wearable will capture media from one of its cameras. The Cupertino tech giant wants to be different from Meta in this regard and could potentially be working on a workaround that would prevent these privacy concerns. While Tim Cook's \"interim solution\" will compete against the likes of Meta, the company is also working on true AR glasses, which will require more time and advanced technologies that are yet to \"be perfected.\" A variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day. Apple also needs to figure out applications that make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. And all this has to be available in large quantities at a price that won\u2019t turn off consumers. Apple could launch smart glasses in the near future to better compete against Meta until it sorts out technologies and the cost associated with it to make it easier for the end user. We will notify you when there is an update to the story, so do stick around.

Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab The Bhamla Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology studies the biomechanics of different organisms. Springtails. Flamingos. Worms. But they don't stop there. The team of biophysicists and bioengineers then shares those discoveries on their gorgeous website along with a companion comic. The comics are the brain child of Saad Bhamla, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and principle investigator of the lab. Since 2020, he's sought to broaden the reach of his lab's research through simple language and colorful illustrations. \"No kid ever would go to Current Biology dot org and actually download and read a research paper. [When I started this], there was this lingering feeling that there has to be a better way to share this beautiful discovery,\" Bhamla told NPR's Short Wave podcast. Sponsor Message The series is called The Curious Zoo of Extraordinary Organisms and has over a dozen comics so far. The series has earned the lab attention throughout the scientific community and is supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER grant . A favorite comic of Bhamla's son describes how an insect \u2014 called the glassy-winged sharpshooter \u2014 uses super propulsion to fling away urine that would otherwise stick to its body. The urine moves through the air 40 times faster than a cheetah accelerates. Enlarge this image The first comic created by the Bhamla Lab was about the slingshot spider. Illustrated by Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab hide caption toggle caption Illustrated by Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab The first comic created by the Bhamla Lab was about the slingshot spider. Illustrated by Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab Studying the organisms is worth more than a few fun facts. Bhamla says researching the biomechanisms of organisms can directly inspire technology for humans. \"We think we can learn a trick or two from the sharpshooter and improve the ability of low power electronics to eject water from tiny crevices and areas, using very minimal energy,\" Bhamla said. At a time when the validity of much scientific research is being called into question, his lab's basic science research is also a helpful connection point with the broader public. Personally, he's bonded with non-scientists over a shared love of animals. The comics are an accessible, joyful touch point. \"I think, sometimes, it takes stepping out of these ivory towers that scientists put themselves in, writing these fancy journals that really exclude, you know, taxpayers, my neighbors who pay for this,\" Bhamla says. \"I think a little bit onus is on us to step out of our comfort zone and not underestimate the average American.

Key Updates and Issues - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer Apple\u2019s iOS 18.5 beta 1 introduces a blend of incremental updates and ongoing challenges, reflecting the company\u2019s continuous efforts to refine its software ecosystem. While the release brings some noteworthy enhancements, it also raises questions about stability, performance, and user satisfaction. The video below from Zollotech examines the key features, user feedback, and broader implications of iOS 18.5, alongside updates across Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Watch this video on YouTube . Key Features: What\u2019s New and What\u2019s Not The first beta of iOS 18.5 delivers several minor updates aimed at improving the user experience. These include: Refinements to the Apple Care and Warranty interface, making it easier to access and understand device coverage details. Improved functionality in the Photos app, offering smoother navigation and better organization tools. Enhanced settings in the Mail app, allowing for more customization and streamlined email management. However, persistent issues continue to affect the overall experience. Users have reported: CarPlay connectivity bugs that disrupt seamless integration with vehicles. Micro-stutters during navigation, which detract from the smoothness of the interface. Wallpaper dimming glitches that interfere with visual consistency. Performance inconsistencies, such as occasional lag and battery drain, remain a concern. While beta versions are inherently experimental, these recurring problems highlight areas where Apple\u2019s software development process could improve. The balance between introducing new features and maintaining system stability remains a critical challenge. User Feedback: A Mixed Bag of Experiences Your experience with iOS 18.5 beta 1 may vary depending on your device model and usage patterns. Some users have reported positive changes, such as improved battery life and smoother app performance. Others, however, have encountered significant issues, including: CarPlay failures that disrupt in-car functionality. App refresh problems, leading to delays in retrieving updated content. Random stuttering during general use, affecting the overall fluidity of the system. Inconsistent battery performance remains a common complaint, with some users resorting to frequent device reboots to address slowdowns. While the beta demonstrates potential, these challenges suggest that further refinements are necessary before the official release. Apple\u2019s ability to address these issues will likely influence user satisfaction with the final version. Siri\u2019s Struggles: A Voice Assistant in Transition Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, continues to face scrutiny for its perceived limitations. Lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada allege that Apple overstated Siri\u2019s capabilities, while internal reports suggest a lack of clear direction in its development. Despite these challenges, speculation about iOS 19 hints at potential improvements to Siri, including enhanced stability and functionality. The voice assistant\u2019s struggles highlight a broader issue within Apple\u2019s ecosystem: the need for consistent innovation that meets user expectations. Whether the rumored updates in iOS 19 will address these concerns remains uncertain, but they represent an opportunity for Apple to rebuild confidence in Siri\u2019s capabilities. Expanding the Apple Ecosystem Apple continues to enhance its broader ecosystem with updates that aim to improve usability and accessibility. Recent developments include: Satellite connectivity expansion to New Zealand and Japan, offering improved global communication options for users in remote areas. Apple Maps accessibility on multiple browsers, including Safari, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, allowing greater cross-platform usability. Inclusion of iPhone 16E parts in Apple\u2019s self-service repair program, empowering users to perform their own repairs and reduce reliance on third-party services. These updates reflect Apple\u2019s commitment to broadening its ecosystem while addressing user needs. By focusing on cross-platform compatibility and user empowerment, Apple is positioning itself as a leader in creating a cohesive and versatile digital environment. Third-Party App Updates: WhatsApp and Instagram Third-party apps within Apple\u2019s ecosystem are also evolving to meet user demands. Recent updates include: WhatsApp\u2019s introduction of encrypted chats, improved group chat features, and smoother video calls, prioritizing secure and efficient communication. Instagram\u2019s reported development for iPad, addressing a long-standing user request for a dedicated app, though no official release date has been announced. These updates underscore the growing importance of third-party apps in enhancing the Apple user experience. By supporting app developers and fostering innovation, Apple strengthens its ecosystem and ensures that users have access to innovative tools and features. Performance and Battery Life: Persistent Concerns Battery life remains a critical concern for many users. While iOS 18.4 delivered mixed results, iOS 18.5 beta 1 shows slight thermal improvements but inconsistent battery performance. Benchmarks indicate stable performance overall, yet some users report slowdowns that require reboots to resolve. These issues highlight the need for Apple to optimize power management and system efficiency in future updates. As battery life continues to be a top priority for users, addressing these concerns will be essential for maintaining satisfaction and trust in Apple\u2019s products. Balancing Innovation and Stability As an iOS user, you may have noticed growing concerns about Apple\u2019s software quality. Some argue that Android offers greater stability, prompting calls for Apple to prioritize reliability and transparency. Striking a balance between innovation and stability remains a key challenge for Apple as it seeks to meet user expectations. By addressing persistent issues and focusing on delivering a seamless user experience, Apple can reinforce its reputation as a leader in technology. The company\u2019s ability to navigate this balance will likely shape its future success and influence its standing in the competitive tech landscape.

Despite hopes for deregulation, Trump\u2019s appointees remain committed to scrutinising tech giants. AI companies like Nvidia and Microsoft are also under investigation. Navbharat Times The Trump administration isn't letting up on the tech giants. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission will face off with Meta in court over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. And on April 21, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should force Google to sell its Chrome web browser to limit the power of its search monopoly. Both cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Donald Trump's first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google's ad technology business. Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and setting proactive regulations for tech. But so far, Trump's appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry's hopes. Live Events \"I think that they may not have fully focused on how much the first Trump presidency had to do with setting in motion this reexamination of tech ,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair.

Who is in charge of antitrust enforcement now? Trump appointed Andrew Ferguson as chair of the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints. \"I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we've got going,\" Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast \"Odd Lots\" this year. The new leader of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Gail Slater, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Trump's first term. She has also pledged to enforce antitrust laws aggressively. \"It's now a bipartisan issue, and there's a consensus around the need for robust antitrust enforcement,\" Slater said at an event hosted this month by Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup accelerator, which has pushed for more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. Where do the major antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants stand? Five government cases accuse tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies, and all are moving through the courts. The companies deny the allegations. The FTC sued Meta in 2020, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 violated the law by using what regulators call a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate its nascent rivals. The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The Justice Department sued Google in 2020 over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a roughly three-week hearing on how to address Google's monopoly. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal. The Justice Department accused Google in 2023 of illegally dominating the advertising technology business. A federal judge heard arguments in that case last year, and a ruling is expected soon. The FTC accused Amazon in a 2023 lawsuit of squeezing small merchants that use its marketplace to sell to consumers. A federal judge rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case last year. It is scheduled to go to trial next year. The Justice Department sued Apple last year over claims that the company's interwoven ecosystem of technology makes it hard for consumers to ditch their iPhones and iPads . Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. What about tech industry mergers and acquisitions? The Biden administration tried and failed to block numerous tech deals, including Meta's purchase of a small virtual reality startup, Within. The push to stop acquisitions outraged investors who back small companies that want to cash out by being acquired by a tech giant. Trump's appointees say they want to get out of the way of acquisitions that don't present a competitive problem. Slater has expressed an openness to companies' proposing settlements -- such as selling off similar assets -- which can help resolve concerns about deals. In late January, the Justice Department sued to block the business software company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper Networks, a networking firm, for $14 billion. It was the first lawsuit to challenge a tech deal in Trump's second term. During the first Trump administration, the Justice Department unsuccessfully challenged AT&T's purchase of Time Warner. What does this mean for the artificial intelligence race? Last year, the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide up responsibility for investigating whether the biggest players in artificial intelligence were violating antitrust laws. The Justice Department started investigating Nvidia , while the FTC took Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI. It is unclear whether those investigations will result in lawsuits. The Trump administration has promised to clear the way for American companies to develop AI, including rescinding a Biden-era executive order that put guardrails on the use of the technology. The administration has solicited the industry's input on how best to move forward with policy around the technology, an opening that companies and investors took to lobby for fewer rules. \"I think it is extremely important that we protect competition in the AI space, but I think it is equally important that the government not race to regulate AI,\" Ferguson said on Bloomberg TV in March.

Photograph: Richard Brooks / AFP via Getty Images Arjun Neil Alim Steff Ch\u00e1vez Mon Apr 14 2025 - 16:20 US stocks gave back early gains on Monday afternoon as markets remained on edge over Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies despite new lenience over the weekend on electronics tariffs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up only slightly, after climbing 1.7 per cent and 2.3 per cent higher in morning trading, respectively. Equities ceded earlier gains as Trump spoke about US border policies and aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia while fielding questions in the Oval Office. \u201cThe markets have been very strong once they got used to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI gave them a little bit of a pause, because, you know, you have to show a little flexibility, but we go back to what we have to do.\u201d READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home New research highlights wealth divide between North and South Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football European stocks made strong gains, as the Trump administration\u2019s proposed tariff exemptions offered investors hope of some relief in the trade war. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 gained 2.7 per cent on Monday, while the UK\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 2.1 per cent. The European rally was broad based, with banking stocks posting the biggest gains. But investors are far from confident that the volatile market moves are over. \u201cGains like today can evaporate quite quickly, so we\u2019re quite cautious,\u201d said Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much longevity I\u2019ll give [the rally],\u201d he added. \u201cWho knows what the next announcement will be.\u201d The gains came after the White House late on Friday excluded smartphones and other consumer electronics from steep tariffs introduced this month. On Sunday, however, administration officials warned that the reprieve would be temporary. Mr Trump\u2019s erratic tariff swerves have driven huge volatility in markets in recent weeks, with his decision last Wednesday to pause \u201creciprocal\u201d levies on most countries other than China sparking a huge rally in US equities. \u201cWhile uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariffs is far from over, we think the pause [on key tech products] indicates a sensitivity to market stress from the administration,\u201d said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. Technology stocks had earlier led the advance, with Apple\u2019s share price jumping 7.5 per cent at the market open in the US, losing some of those gains to trade at 5.3 per cent higher by mid-morning in New York. Mr Trump and Howard Lutnick, US commerce secretary, on Sunday indicated that consumer electronics would instead be subject to a separate duty the White House was preparing for semiconductors. It was unclear what level the chips tariffs would be set at, but other duties the Trump administration has imposed on individual sectors such as steel and aluminium suggest they could be substantially lower than the levies currently imposed on China. The early lift in US markets followed earlier gains in Europe and Asia. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 gained 2.5 per cent by afternoon trading in Europe, while the UK\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 2 per cent. Dutch chipmakers Besi and ASML were up 4.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively by the afternoon in Europe. In comments to journalists on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said his administration would show \u201cflexibility\u201d for some products and signalled that it would be speaking to key companies to discuss the tariffs. Asked what the semiconductor levy rate would be, he told reporters he would \u201cbe announcing it over the next week\u201d. Mr Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, announced at a \u201cliberation day\u201d event this month, unleashed turmoil across financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession. But stocks rallied at the end of the week, after Trump\u2019s decision to put a 90-day pause on big \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for most countries fed optimism that the worst-case trade scenario could be avoided. The prospect of lower tariffs on popular consumer electronics would be a boost for Apple and other tech groups that rely heavily on Chinese factories to make iPhones and other goods. \u201cWe might be past peak tariff fear,\u201d said Michael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, adding that the new exemptions were a \u201creasonably significant backing off\u201d on the level of tariffs expected at the end of last week. Haven assets were steady. Gold touched a fresh record high of just over $3,245 per troy ounce on Monday morning, before giving up its gains. Markets in Asia rebounded, led by Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index up 2.4 per cent, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rising 1.2 per cent and the broad Topix up 0.9 per cent. China\u2019s mainland CSI 300 rose 0.2 per cent as official data showed exports from the world\u2019s second-largest economy leapt last month amid a rush to dispatch shipments before tariffs took effect. Exports rose 12.4 per cent in US dollar terms in March on a year earlier, figures from China\u2019s customs administration showed on Monday, well above expectations and the biggest rise since October. Imports fell 4.3 per cent, a less steep contraction than the 8.4 per cent fall in the January-February period. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Donald Trump US tariffs IN THIS SECTION Zuckerberg says Meta has more competitors than FTC claims New research highlights wealth divide between North and South Why is Ireland-US tourist data going south?

Written by David Delima | Updated: 14 April 2025 12:02 IST Photo Credit: Apple Apple Vision Pro (pictured) was unveiled by the company in 2023 Highlights Apple Vision Pro 2 could be launched with a major change in functionality The company is also said to be working on a more affordable refresh The mixed reality headset may succeed the two-year-old Vision Pro model Advertisement Apple Vision Pro 2 is in the works with support for 'high-end enterprise applications' and low latency connectivity, according to Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman. The Cupertino company is said to be working on the successor to its first generation Vision Pro mixed reality headset that went on sale in the US and other countries last year. Meanwhile, Apple is also reportedly developing a refreshed version of the Vision Pro that will be more affordable and lighter than the first model. Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be Tethered to Mac Computer Unlike the first generation Apple Vision Pro, which is a wireless mixed reality headset, the second generation spatial computer from Apple will be tethered to a Mac computer, Gurman writes in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter. This is likely to be the biggest change in terms of functionality, according to the journalist. The wired connection is said to deliver low latency connectivity that can enable support for advanced enterprise applications, or even stream the contents of a Mac's display on the Vision Pro 2. Apple was previously working on a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses \u2014 also tethered to a Mac computer \u2014 but that project has reportedly been scrapped in favour of the Apple Vision Pro 2. Apple Vision Pro 2 Reportedly Enters Production According to Gurman, Apple is also working on a refreshed version of the first generation Vision Pro model, which is lighter. The company's first mixed reality headset can weigh between 600g and 650g, without the external battery pack. The refreshed model is also expected to be cheaper than the Vision Pro, which costs $3,500 (roughly Rs. 3.01 lakh). Meta's most expensive mixed reality headset costs $500 (roughly Rs. 43,100), which is much lower, and Apple could be working on a cheaper refresh to compete with the Meta Quest 3. Apple Intelligence Comes to Apple Vision Pro With visionOS 2.4 Update Apple Shuffles AI Executive Ranks in Bid to Turn Around Siri Apple Intelligence Features in the Vision Pro Might Arrive by April Earlier this month, a report claimed that Apple would launch the Vision Pro 2 model later this year, and that components for the headset were already in production. Given the lacklustre sales of the first-generation Apple Vision Pro and the ongoing uncertainty related to tariffs, it remains to be seen how Apple keeps up demand for the Vision Pro 2, if it is launched in the coming months.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Taken from CNBC\u2019s Daily Open, our international markets newsletter \u2014 Subscribe today On late Friday, the Trump administration welcomed the weekend in the best way: by announcing that electronics \u2014 such as smartphones, computers and semiconductors \u2014 will be temporarily exempted from his so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, including the baseline 10% rate on all countries. That means such products imported from China will apparently not be subjected to the 125% tariff U.S. President Donald Trump slapped on Beijing (a 20% tariff will remain). Apple CEO Tim Cook must be heaving a sigh of relief: The Cupertino-based company manufactures around 80% of iPads and more than half of Mac computers in China , according to an estimate from Evercore ISI. The news is also a relief for consumers, who desperately need an uplift in mood, based on the findings of the University of Michigan's latest survey . After all, it's not just corporations and importers that are affected by tariffs. Laptop prices have already shot up, according to disgruntled comments on Reddit. The Nintendo Switch 2 preorder was postponed . Perhaps even Trump is keeping in mind the famous Wall Street adage: Don't bet against the U.S. consumer. What you need to know today Tech exempted from tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from his reciprocal tariffs, according to guidance issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday evening. However, Trump and his aides on Sunday suggested those exemptions would be partially or completely reversed in coming weeks, adding to the confusion over abrupt policy changes. U.S. markets rise amid a volatile week U.S. stocks climbed Friday to end the week on a positive note despite heavy market turbulence caused by the Trump administration's tariffs. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 5.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 5% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 7.3%. Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index popped over 2%, leading gains in the region. Japan's Nikkei 225 added more than 1.6%. Consumers in the U.S. are really downcast Consumer sentiment in April sank further , according to the University of Michigan 's survey. It posted a mid-month reading of 50.8 \u2014 the lowest since June 2022 and the second lowest in the survey's history going back to 1952 \u2014 below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 54.6. At the same time, respondents' expectation for inflation a year from now leaped to 6.7%, the highest level since November 1981 and up from 5% in March. 'Very close' to a recession BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday told CNBC that he thinks \" we're very close, if not in, a recession now .\" However, Fink said he did not think the U.S. was in a financial crisis and expects \"megatrends\" like artificial intelligence would persist. Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio raised similar alarm bells Sunday, saying the country is \" very close to a recession \" \u2014 but he's \"worried about something worse than a recession\" if the situation isn't handled well. Exports from China soar China's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year ago, in U.S. dollar terms, according to data released by its customs authority Monday. That significantly beats Reuters' poll estimates of a 4.4% growth and is the biggest increase since October last year. Imports fell 4.3% in March from a year earlier, more than economists' expectations of a 2% decline. Singapore downgrades growth forecast The Monetary Authority of Singapore on Monday eased its monetary policy for the second time in a row. The central bank also announced a 3.8% year-over-year expansion in Singapore's economy for the first quarter, missing the Reuters poll estimate of 4.3% growth. The country's Ministry of Trade and Industry cut its gross domestic product forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, down from its previous outlook of 1%-3%. [PRO] What would Buffett do?

Transcript of Interview with Tara Cremin Joanna: Tara Cremin is the director of Kobo Writing Life, Kobo's independent publishing platform. Welcome back to the show, Tara. Tara: Thanks, Jo. Thanks for having me. Joanna: Oh, it is great to have you back on the show. It's actually been four years, which is crazy. Tara: I can't believe it. Joanna: I know. So I thought we'd go back to the beginning. Tell us a bit more about you. When did you get into the book business, and what are some of the changes you've seen for authors since then? Tara: Sure. So I've been working for Kobo since 2012, which feels like a lifetime. When I started, the company had created some great, but kind of relatively simple, eReaders. They were just starting to dip their toe into really expanding what physical devices could do. Then you fast forward to 2025, and we're the second largest manufacturer of eReaders , after our friends in Seattle. So part of the work that I do on Kobo Writing Life, I've been working on it basically since day one. Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform for authors who wanted to publish directly to Kobo readers. So I've been kind of working on that. The biggest change on the author side that I can really think of is just the expansion of the tools. I think it's easy to not always think back to 2012 because things move so quickly. I'll be like, \u201cOh, that was ages ago,\u201d but it'll be like four years ago. When you're actually thinking about 2012, authors were uploading a Word doc and publishing their ebook, and then that was it. There wasn't a lot of different things available or more opportunities. Now, authors can really easily create accessible and like really beautifully designed ePubs with tools like Vellum and Atticus . They can publish audiobooks to Kobo, they can reach libraries, join subscription programs, and take advantage of all the promotional tools that are available. So I think the biggest change is just that there's more opportunities now for authors than when I started working in the book business. Joanna: Oh, and\u2014 What about the growth of Kobo for indies? I mean, we've heard before some of the stats around the number of self-published books on the Kobo platform. That's grown as well, hasn't it? Tara: It has. I have some stats for you. When we look at self-publishing on Kobo, it makes up about 25% of the units for single copy sales . Then if we think about the subscription reading, it makes up about 60% of English language subscription reading is all self-published content. It's huge . Joanna: Wow, that's incredible. So indie authors are important to Kobo, I guess we could say. Tara: Yes, and it started with somebody wanting to email a Word doc and get it published, which is why Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform. We've really been able to expand it and add additional features. Kobo has always taken a global stance of the digital book market, and I think we realized pretty early that the indie authors were really integral to that. Something that I don't think we talk about a lot because I'm primarily focused on the English language side, but we also have a portal that's just for users in Japan that's very self-contained in Japanese. Last year, we actually localized in traditional and simplified Chinese for our friends in Taiwan and Hong Kong. So the Kobo Writing Life platform is now available in eight languages. So we know how integral the independent authors are to the global book business. Joanna: Kobo originally was Canadian, right? Then it was bought by a Japanese company. Tara: Yes, so we're still headquartered in Toronto. We have a global presence, where we have offices in Taiwan, in Tokyo, Darmstadt and Dublin, and with a generous sprinkling of people throughout Europe. We were acquired by Rakuten, maybe prior to me joining, 2010, 2011, and we've been sort of their digital book area of that ever since then. So having this enormous company backing has been really, really helpful, but we do maintain quite a Canadian-centric grassroots focus with the HQ being here in Toronto . Joanna: Absolutely. So one of the changes you mentioned has been the subscription model. As you mentioned, our friends in Seattle have one that's quite famous that is an exclusive program. Kobo Plus is not exclusive, so people can be in that as well as selling their ebooks elsewhere, which I love. How does Kobo Plus subscription compare to some of the other subscription models for ebooks and audiobooks? Like, what is it for readers and listeners? Tara: Sure, I think it's maybe important to see why people have gone down the subscription route, for people that are potentially a little bit hesitant of that. So when we're thinking about the book business as a whole, or Kobo's history, I think in about 2015 we could see that there was a whole generation of consumers that were coming that were consuming most of their media by not purchasing it once at a time, and they were signing up for subscriptions . Whether this be music or movies or TV shows, I think we knew that books and audiobooks were going to go this way. As a retailer that was really doing a great job at selling books one at a time, we wanted to reach this subscription consumer without disrupting the business we had built and doing it in a way that benefited us, the publishers, the authors, but also the readers who were looking for this. So we tested this in a contained market. So it was launched back in 2017 in the Netherlands. This is because we had a really great market share there. A strong, willing partner, Bol, who wanted to test this out. One of the also key factors was that there's some of the biggest piracy rates in Europe were found in the Netherlands. So we wanted to see if we could convert those users who were already sometimes using Kobo devices. They're reading, they're just not paying for the reading. So we wanted to see if we could make this very easy, self-contained platform, could we convert them to paying users? Then what we found from that is that it really didn't cannibalize the a la carte sales. We had new customers signing up, and we could kind of see where they were coming from. Some of them were coming over from Kindle Unlimited, some of them coming from piracy. Some of them had been maybe just library users that had been moved into this kind of easier one click model. Some of them had never read an ebook before, but used it as a way to step their toe into the digital reading. What we found is that \u2014 Publishers and authors, they all earned more as a result of the new readers [on subscription]. So what we looked at with these findings was\u2014gosh, it'll be almost 10 years now, which is wild. Time doesn't exist anymore, Joanna\u2014but with the findings from the Netherlands, we've been able to expand Kobo Plus. As of this recording, we are currently in 23 countries , which is including all of our core markets. There'll be more to come, probably shortly after this comes out, actually, but I can't quite say where. So 23 countries right now. Like you've mentioned, we're not the only subscription model out there, but what makes us a little bit different is the focus on the importance of the authors and wanting to give them flexibility, while also trying to reach this subscription reader. So it was really important to us that we didn't lock any authors into exclusivity. Our ethos around KWL is really trying to encourage authors to publish widely on as many platforms as they can, to reach as many readers as they can. We just want to make sure that the Kobo experience of you publishing widely is really easy and that you're not spending too much time on it because you're balancing all of these other platforms. So we built this out so authors can pick and choose the country. They can choose all of them if they want, which is what I would always recommend. If you're a wide author that's publishing globally, I don't know why you wouldn't put your books in, but perhaps you didn't want to hit up your main markets, like the US or Canada. You do have the option of like excluding those, or you can select all of them. What's a cool way about selecting all of them is that it actually includes future territories. So as we've been rapidly expanding Kobo Plus, you don't have to do anything. Your books are already there when we add to new places. So that's been pretty cool. We're not locking authors into any timed period. You can put your books in, and you can take them out if you're not happy with it. I always encourage people to leave them in, to really try to reach that readership. Again, we wanted to give authors as much control as possible, and really just get authors to try it out. Like try out an older series, maybe try it out in the Netherlands, where you haven't really thought about selling books before, and eventually get really comfortable adding their catalog to Kobo plus. So for us, it was really all about building author trust over time when it comes to subscriptions . I feel people are more comfortable with it now than before, and I think it's easy to get people comfortable when the revenue is increasing, I think. Joanna: So all my books that are on Kobo are in Kobo Plus . I also agree, I think there's a group of readers for whom\u2014readers and listeners, we should say\u2014because this is audiobooks as well, right? Tara: Yes, it is. Depending on the territory, but primarily they all have ebooks and audiobooks. So from a customer perspective, you can either pay for all you can read for a month, all you can listen for a month, or all you can read and listen. So those are the options. Joanna: Exactly. So this is the thing, I think as authors, we have to think about different groups of readers. So even as we record this, I've got a Kickstarter happening. There is an ebook, there is an audiobook, which will eventually be on Kobo, but for now, they're just on Kickstarter. Then there's a gorgeous hardback with foil and ribbon and all of that kind of thing, which Kobo doesn't sell beautiful hardbacks, right? I mean, and neither does Amazon, neither does Apple. [The special hardback vs subscription.] They're different audiences. It's a completely different audience, someone who's going to buy that hardback to someone who's going to borrow the audiobook in the Netherlands. Tara: Yes. I mean, I love seeing what authors are doing with these. That must be so satisfying for you to get that copy of this beautiful book. So, yes, we really wanted to just focus on the digital experience, especially when it comes to our devices as well. We make some of the best e-reading devices\u2014I mean, I would say they are the best\u2014but like, we're making the best eReaders that are available. We launched our first color eReaders last year, and the reception to them was just tremendous. So our eReaders have integration with ebooks and audiobooks . You can connect via Bluetooth to speakers or headphones. We also have Overdrive capabilities, like Overdrive is built into the e reader, so you can access the library from within Kobo. One of the things that we've been doing, l think we've just launched it maybe last year. You can tell I don't work on the device side, I'm not quite as sharp with my dates. It's always been very important for us to have it be this open platform. So having users be able to just use the eReader to read books, and if we can make it easy for them to purchase books with subscriptions and convert them to paying users, that's awesome, but we do have integration with Dropbox. With our newer eReaders, you can actually write notes with the Kobo Stylist, and you can mark up the files themselves, and there's integration within that. We've recently added Google Drive integration, which is super easy. I just used it the other day when I was giving a presentation, and I had my notes that I was able to convert over and read from my Kobo, which was really helpful. I was actually able to mark up and make changes as I'm going along on the Kobo eReader itself, which is pretty cool. Joanna: Of course, if people buy my ebook from the Kickstarter, they can read that on Kobo because it doesn't have to be like DRMed into \u2014that's too technical. It doesn't have to be a specifically Kobo ebook is what you're saying. Tara: No, no, no. We always just use the ePub standard. Actually, I shouldn't be saying that because you can also add PDFs and things like that. So, no, it's not a locked system. Joanna: I think that's really good too. So let's get into some of the other things. I mean, like we mentioned, the gorgeous hardbacks that are the current trend in the indie community. I mean, they really are kind of all people are talking about. You and I were talking about doing this episode because at the end of the day \u2014 The bread and butter income for most indie authors is still digital. It's like, we move on to the sexiest thing. In 2012 ebooks were pretty sexy, right? I mean, they were like, \u201cOh, we can do this, and we can do this.\u201d Then it was audiobooks and print-on-demand and all of that, and now it's gorgeous hardbacks. So let's just go back in to the sort of bread and butter. What are your tips for maximizing income from ebooks and audiobooks on Kobo? I know that's a massive question, but let's pick a few things. Tara: I think it's still really important to make beautiful books, even if it's digital . I mean because authors are primarily digital first. A lot of publishers are not. They're still really focused on the print. So I think it's really important to think about making a really great digital file, which, like I mentioned, it's just easier than ever now. You actually don't even have to think about it that much, the tools just do it for you. I think it's important to have a file that can be read easily because the last thing we want to do is have some sort of technical glitch that is interrupting somebody's hard won reading time. We really just want the person to be always trying to get the next book, so making sure the file itself is beautiful and working perfectly, I think is really important. I think it's important to consider making accessible files so that everyone can read your book . Digital reading opens up a world to people that might have limitations around physical book reading. There are a number of people that can only read digitally, and it just allows for a more inclusive reading experience. So something to be mindful of as well. Joanna: Just on that\u2014 Is there something special we need to do for accessibility for an ebook? Tara: So I have a book recommendation for everyone called Content For Everyone , by Jeff Adams and Michele Lucchini. We had them on the Kobo Writing Life Podcast, and it was just a great conversation. I would say to check out their book because it has a lot of practical advice for authors on making accessible content. So not even just the ebooks themselves, but also author websites and newsletters. It's really full of actionable tips. They are far more versed in this than I would be to try and reiterate some of their stuff. Joanna: Jeff's been on this show, and we talked about it then . I got the impression that if you use, let's say, Vellum or Atticus for your ebook publishing, that does cover the content, at least, of an ebook. Tara: Yes, yes, perfect. Joanna: Okay, great. So just to be clear, there wasn't anything extra we were missing. Tara: No, no. Just to make sure that that is kind of being done, and you're not creating files that are inaccessible. Joanna: Which, to me, it means that Kobo is still getting a ton of badly formatted files, which I thought we were way past that. Tara: It's not that it's badly formatted, I think you have to consider the millions of books that exist, and especially the older catalog. So newer books might be accessible, but the older books that you've created back in 2012 might not be. So a lot of the work we're doing is just an education around making sure that your book files are of the best content or the best quality that they can be, like before vellum existed. Joanna: Oh, yes. I used to use Scrivener back in the day. I know some people still do, but Scrivener, I used to get errors all the time. I love Scrivener for writing, but for listeners, I would say Vellum or Atticus is the best in class these days. Okay, back on to maximizing income. Tara: So I would say that \u2014 For Kobo, box sets are super popular. So when you're thinking about selling books one at a time, and authors primarily are writing in series, or that's sort of the trend that we see through Kobo Writing Life, you definitely want to bundle your books. Something to remember is that on Kobo, we don't have a higher price cap . So you can go over $9.99, and still earn 70% on each sale. So with the box sets, again, you want to make sure that you have an easy to navigate table of contents because this is a larger file that readers are browsing through. So you want to make sure that they're able to do that with ease. Which I'm sure, again, these tools can kind of easily create this for you, but just something to be mindful of when you're bundling the books together. Joanna: Yes. I think bringing up box sets is really good because the KWL promotion tab i s great. I go in every three weeks, and I apply for as much as I can get. Although, just so everyone knows, I don't get every promotion. Like nobody gets every promotion, right? You just have to apply for a ton of them. There are always box set promotions going on. Tara: Yes, we rotate around pretty regularly with them because our readers are just so interested in having box sets. It's funny because I think we think about box sets as like a discounted opportunity to have these books, but that's not really how readers are taking them. They're taking them as like this is a convenient way to have this one series in this one book . So I'd always recommend pricing them for their value and just making sure that they're available for the reader who doesn't want to like click on books one by one, and just have this bigger box set. Something to keep in mind with the covers is that we do accept the 3D box sets with the plain white backgrounds, but if you're thinking about promotions or applying to promotions, we might be a little bit less inclined to accept those, just because it makes your cover really small and it makes it harder to read. You already have limited space on a website in terms of a cover, so I really like to \u2014 Think of box set covers as they're almost as an ad for your series. So you can kind of use it as an opportunity to encapsulate the theme of your series within your box set cover. Joanna: Then just on that, just on Kobo Plus, we didn't say\u2014So a lot of authors are used to the \u2018pages read' idea. How is that done on Kobo Plus for reading and listening? Tara: The biggest difference, I guess, between Kobo Plus and some of the other platforms is that we base our payment on\u2014well, it's a very similar revenue share model\u2014but it's based on the minutes that your book has been read versus the page reads. This allows us to treat ebooks and audiobooks the same, and it kind of reduces a little bit of the gamification that we've seen on some other platforms . So we're really taking into account the time that somebody is spending on your book. Joanna: Yes, because some people were able to game other systems by sort of getting bots or paying people to click through pages and stuff like that. Oh, but it's funny, isn't it? I mean, whenever humans can find a way to game a system, they will. Tara: We're very clever people. Joanna: We are. We are very clever people. Okay, so\u2014 What about some other ways of maximizing income? Tara: So I would say with audiobooks that we're talking about, so you can publish audiobooks to Kobo as well, through Kobo Writing Life. You may not see the tab right away, and actually the same with the promotions tab, but you just have to send the team an email to enable this for you. If you email writinglife@kobo.com you can ask for audiobooks and for promotions. Just as we were talking about the box set covers there, I think something to keep in mind with audiobooks, we will crop the cover for you. If you want to make sure that you're making the best cover, audiobooks are square and not rectangular, so sometimes we do see kind of like a really squished cover. That would just be something to be a bit mindful of when you're publishing audiobooks, to just make sure that you're selling the book because we are unfortunately always judging books by their covers. Joanna: Yes, absolutely. I guess\u2014 One of the things I've noticed with Kobo is that the vast majority of my Kobo income is fiction rather than nonfiction. Is there a split like that? Tara: There probably is, but I feel like the nonfiction market for us is definitely growing, especially with our new devices. We've done a lot of work to try to cater to the nonfiction reader, and what we call like an immersive reading experience. You can see this with the writing within the book itself. There's easy ways to flip back and forth between the pages. We basically have the digital version of like a thumb in the side of the pages, so you don't lose your spot, but you can actually flip through the book and then flip back again. So it's definitely growing, but I think what we see, especially on Kobo Writing Life, it would be fiction that would be primarily what people are reading right now . Joanna: Well, I'll put another sort of ask in for the promotional tab, which is mainly fiction focused, I find. I do always look for nonfiction promotions there. To be clear, again, for people listening, I do think to sell books on Kobo, it is good to be part of the promotional opportunities . You can really get in front of new readers that way. So that would be one of the things I would like to see, is more nonfiction and memoir promotional opportunities. Tara: For sure. I will take this to the team. Joanna: Yes. Take the feedback! Let's talk about libraries because some authors are worried about libraries. I mean, obviously authors want libraries to have their ebooks and audiobooks, but they're also worried about the money. If an author goes with the library and Overdrive, how do they get paid for that? Tara: So it's really easy to opt your books in. It's part of the publication process, so it's in the rights and distribution section. So you just have to set a price in USD, and that'll be your library price for the book . The general rule of thumb is roughly around the same as a mass market paperback. You just want to make sure that you're not putting the same price as your just straight up digital book because of the loaning factor when it comes to the library books. Sometimes we have authors that want to appeal to libraries by putting it in at a lower price, and I always kind of remind them that the librarians have two ways of purchasing the books through Kobo Writing Life. So they can publish on a one copy, one user. This is kind of like when you think of a traditional book, that we have this one book and that can be loaned out multiple times. So that's why you want to increase the price because you want to cover the loans that are happening with that. They also have the opportunity to buy your book on a cost per checkout option, and that's for a one-time loan for 10% of the price. So if your library book is $19.99, they could also just buy your book for a one-time loan for $1.99. So that can really appeal to them. We have a lot of the library sales that are demand driven, so it's people actually going in and asking for your book. So it's really great to be able to offer to a librarian, like actually, you can buy it just this one time, and maybe you'll buy it a few times for the lower price. Then if it's really popular, then you'll buy it for the higher price again. So we see that happening quite a lot. Authors that distribute to Overdrive through Kobo, they earn 50% of any sale that happens. Joanna: Yes. So just to put people's mind at ease \u2014 You can support libraries and get paid. So this is one of the ways you can say to people, you can listen or read my books for free. Just ask the librarian to stock them, or just go to your library app. I think that's a good one. I wanted to come on to the authors who do really well on KWL. What are the commonalities that you see amongst top selling authors? What do you see working that we can model? Tara: Well, like you've mentioned, the promotions tool that we have. I was trying to think about instances of authors that have moved widely in the past couple of years and are finding success on Kobo, and they're honestly the ones that have leveraged their promotions. It can take a little while to build a Kobo audience , and I just always recommend applying to the promotions that are relevant to your books and applying regularly. I like to think about it as, like, the worst case scenario is that you're putting your books in front of the right eyes. It can just be quite competitive because there's a lot of people applying, but it's our merchandising team that are going through them. So I definitely would say the ones that are building the audience and finding success on Kobo are really leveraging the promotions with us. Then also, that's audio and library promotions that we have too. I think if you're publishing audiobooks, and I know this can be really tricky to balance, but if you can make sure that you're publishing your ebook and your audiobook on the same day and do those same releases, I think that's really important to building sales. We found authors that have kind of reported that it's a bigger impact for their audio when they do that versus when they release it at a later date or anything. So you can try and line them up as the one book release. Joanna: Well, then that brings me on to something, having obviously done audiobooks for many years. Sometimes I narrate them myself, sometimes I have paid people, but recently, and in fact, my Death Valley audiobook \u2014I haven't told you this\u2014but it is narrated by my voice clone, my AI voice clone . Today, as we record this, I put a couple of chapters up on The Creative Penn Podcast, so people can have a listen. I've already had comments that say, \u201cI would not have known this was an AI. It sounds exactly like you.\u201d This will be, I think, the first time in however long I've been doing this now, 2007, I've been able to publish ebook and audiobook on the same day. Tara: Oh, wow. Joanna: Because, as you said, it is incredibly hard to do that because most of us, in the past, we've maybe sold the ebook first, made some money, then eventually been able to pay for the audiobook. Before Kobo, when you could put it up there, you put them on another platform, they never went live on the same day. There was a long time we couldn't do preorders. So, I guess we're coming onto the AI discussion because AI-narrated audiobooks, certainly for me, ElevenLabs, the difference in the amount of work and pain for me as an audiobook narrator is incredible. So I don't know if I'm ever going to human-narrate again. I mean, it literally is fantastic. So let's come on to AI. What is Kobo's stance on AI-assisted ebooks, AI-narrated audiobooks, AI-created covers? I know this is a tough question, but we have to cover it. Tara: AI is definitely the biggest thing that is disrupting the book industry at the moment. When it comes to us at Kobo, we kind of go back to the core principles of what makes a reader's life worse, and can we avoid it? And what makes a reader's life better, and can we take advantage of it? So AI, we know, will open the floodgates to lots of books being published that are like purely machine generated, which really impacts organic discovery, especially for indies. Part of the upside of this is that it becomes a curation problem, and that's something that we're here for . We're here to solve that problem. So with Kobo Writing Life specifically, we accept AI audiobooks, and we just ask that they're clearly labeled that it's machine read. It's really just a customer expectation or just have something that's mentioning that it's a machine read audiobook. We do discourage the publication of ebooks that are solely generated by AI, and this is just trying to root out the bad actors . We're not trying to root out any authors who are serious about making a career with their works, but we're just trying to discourage the people that are bad actors within this space. So when we think about it from an indie author perspective, I think it's good practice to include disclosure, which I think is something that you do, Joanna. I think of you as like a leader in the best practices in this space. Joanna: I do try. Just on the audiobook, so I have a button, like a yellow button, that says \u201cdigitally narrated.\u201d It's so funny because I see now in the traditional publishing industry they're saying, \u201cOh, we need labeling,\u201d and I'm like, I've been labeling my books for years. I mean, come on. Like before it was required, I ticked all the boxes and talked about it. Also, I don't have an issue with that. I think honesty is really important. Also, I feel like all these things make my work better. I'm not doing it to try to scam anyone or be worse. I'm trying to be better. I do think, though, we are in a transition period. I think this will be so pervasive within a year or two that it won't make that much difference. For now, I guess, as you say, it's marking this. So I will be filling in whatever I need to fill in. Tara: Yes, I think it's good practice. I mean, it is a personal decision, and I think you just have to think about the reader. You just don't want to disappoint the person that is buying your book. Like, that's what it ultimately comes down to for us. Then we also know that it's okay to use AI as a tool, especially with indie authors who have to balance writing with the entire business of also being your own publisher. So whether you're using it as a tool to create you a calendar or spreadsheet that makes sure that you're hitting all your preorder dates. There's things that can make your life easier because you have to wear so many hats. So we understand that as well. So when I think about AI, like from a book selling perspective, I think the interesting opportunity comes in how we can leverage AI in some of our recommendations, like summarizations and curation . So I can't really go into too much detail on what we're working on yet, but we're really excited about better recommendations and curation that really benefit us all. We just want to keep people's attention on long form reading by putting really good stuff in front of them, and we can do this without using books as training data inside an LLM. So, yes, we're excited about this. Any Kobo Writing Life authors that are listening, you can expect some changes for to the Kobo Writing Life terms to come. I hope that things aren't seen as anything that's too scary. We're really trying to just support some new initiatives and be really, really clear about what we're asking for. We're not interested in making new content. We don't want to make things from books that authors entrust us with. What we do want to do is make reading better and keep people reading more and for longer. We're trying to earn a space in reading amongst everything else that's going on in the digital world, and we really believe that we can do this. Joanna: Yes, I like that. It's interesting, though, because you mentioned there about\u2014and this is obviously important\u2014that you're not going to just upload everyone's books to some big LLM and do stuff with it. You're not going to do that. It's funny because for many, many years, I've said, \u2018why is the book itself not the metadata?' So we've had to come up with categories, keywords. We've had to have genre-specific covers. The thing is, if I have a book, say Death Valley \u2014it's like 70,000 words, it's a full length thriller\u2014and I have to write a sales description, which is\u2014well, in fact, Claude writes my sales descriptions now\u2014but it's not long enough. What you want with some kind of AI curation recommendation engine is the emotional promise of this, the characters in this, the feeling you get by reading this, matches these books over here, which just will not be surfaced in a normal book recommendation engine. In fact, for the last year or so\u2014 I've been using ChatGPT as my main book recommendation engine because it can do this much more nuanced search. I found really some quite old books as well have come up. So is that something that\u2014I know you're not going to read everything in\u2014but what do you think about that? Tara: I think you're spot on in the kind of way that the book recommendations can be going and can be leveraged. We just want to make more thoughtful recommendations. It's interesting that you're saying that it's older books too, because that's something that we see with the subscription with Kobo Plus when I look at some of the top read books. They're often coming from like 2017, 2018. So there's ways to resurface things that exist that people want to read . We can do this in a thoughtful way and an easier way than us having to rely on metadata that's been provided. If I want to be able to find a list of like Canadian authors, it's not as easy as potentially it can be. There's instances like that. It's all about, again, trying to find the right book for the right reader and just keeping them reading . That's what we're focused on. Joanna: At the end of the day, I mean, we're book people, and it kind of drives me up the wall when authors get annoyed with other authors. I'm like, look, let's get upset about how much time people spend gaming or how much time people to spend on TV. We just want everyone to read. Whatever they read is good. We just want people to read books. I know, obviously, that's what Kobo wants as well. Tara: I think it was like on Threads or a meme or something that I read recently, where it was like, reading is almost radical now . In a time where we just want faster content and we're consuming things faster, it's a bit radical to be like, actually, I'm going to sit down for two hours and just be immersed in this world and really think about myself and expand my thoughts on other things because I'm not going to be distracted by four things at once. It must have been some meme that, ironically, grabbed my attention for this radical thought process. Joanna: That's ironic. Tara: I know, but I was just like, that's right. It's something that we don't do. I mean, it's, I guess, comparable to going to the movies and like actually sitting there and not being distracted. It's the same sort of thing where it's radical to take that time for yourself, and we want people to be able to do that. Joanna: We're almost out of time, but I just wanted us to mention the Kobo Writing Life Podcast. Since this is a podcast, people might enjoy the KWL Show, and that has been going for many years now. What can people find over on the KWL Podcast if they want to click over and have a listen? Tara: We just released episode 366, which is wild. So you can find us anywhere where you listen to podcasts . We release an episode every week, but we rotate between new interviews, and then we've been resurfacing some of our great content from our backlist with a little thing we're calling the Kobo Rewriting Life Podcast. So there'll be a new episode, a Rewriting Life new episode, and so on and so forth. There's a wealth of really good information. We focus on the craft and business of writing. It's a mix of traditional authors and indies. Jo, you've been a guest, and we'd love to have you back. I think you're going to come on soon. Joanna: Yes, at some point. Tara: I think for anyone that is interested in Kobo, or maybe you're new to what we do, at the end of 2024 we released an interview with Michael Tamblyn, who is our CEO. He is probably a little bit more eloquent than me in explaining the things that we've just talked about. He really gives a great outline of Kobo, Kobo Writing Life, and I just really like being able to spotlight that because it really informs the fact that Kobo is a book company, and we're being led by a book guy. I think that's something to be celebrated, and just kind of shows our overall focus into the reading space. Joanna: Well, we should also remind people what Kobo is an acronym for. Tara: Literally, it's the word \u2018book.' Joanna: I feel like we forget to say that because we know it, but there might be people listening who didn't know. Tara: I worked there for years before I realized that it was actually an anagram of the word book. I think I was definitely three years in before it hit me. I was like, oh, right. Joanna: Oh, yes, that's what it is. Michael Tamblyn is\u2014I've been at London Book Fair\u2014and he's often the very best speaker in publishing. I mean, he really is very entertaining and very positive about indie authors, which I really appreciate. I've heard him defend indie authors to the publishing industry. So I love that, and I'm obviously a happy KWL user. So Tara\u2014 Where can people find the Kobo Writing Life team if they want to connect? Tara: So you can email us at writinglife@kobo.com . We're on most of the socials. We haven't quite ventured into TikTok yet, but you can find us on Facebook and Instagram and Threads and YouTube. If you are interested in creating an account or learning more about it, you can go to Kobo.com/writinglife . Joanna: Brilliant. Thanks so much for your time, Tara. That was great. Tara: Thank you.

Home News You are here No price hike for Samsung Galaxy phones, at least for now By Mariyan Slavov Published: Apr 14, 2025, 2:49 AM 0 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Up Next: Things have been moving at a breakneck speed in the past couple of days regarding the tariff situation. US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most major production hubs in addition to a baseline 10% tariff on all countries. These tariffs went into effect on April 5, with China being hit the hardest with a 54% reciprocal tax on imports (later bumped up to 145%). This made people rush to Apple stores to buy iPhones before any potential price hike, but Samsung and Galaxy phones were also in danger. The Korean company manufactures most of its phones in Vietnam, and that country is now subject to a 46% tariff. After the tariffs went into effect, Trump decided to pause taxing most of the countries (except China) for 90 days after a backlash from more than 75 countries. \"Based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the [US Trade Representative], to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\" - Donald Trump, president of the United States Receive the latest Samsung news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . Now it seems that the President has had another change of heart, as he announced a tariff exemption for key electronics such as smartphones, computers, memory products, and more. So the prices of Samsung Galaxy phones most likely will remain unchanged, and this applies to other big brands as well, such as Apple and Google. OnePlus was one of the first brands to fall victim to the new tariffs , being forced to raise the price of the OnePlus Watch 3 from $329 to $499 without any explanation, but now we expect prices to return to their previous state. With tariff exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other electronics, imports from outside the US will continue to be taxed with the normal 10% flat rate, and it should be business as usual for Samsung, Apple, and the like. Which in turn is good news for customers in the States. There's yet another turn of events that suggest that this exemption for smartphones and other electronics may be only temporary , but we have to wait and see. Things are changing by the hour.

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Denis Staunton Mon Apr 14 2025 - 07:23 Chinese exports surged in March ahead of Donald Trump \u2019s imposition of a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, Beijing said on Monday. Exports rose 12.4 per cent compared to March last year, according to official data, a bigger than expected jump that compared to a 2.3 per cent increase in the first two months of the year. The announcement came hours after the White House said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs announced on Friday was only a temporary reprieve. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday that the exempted electronics products would face new tariffs, along with semiconductors, within the next two months READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home New research highlights wealth divide between North and South Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football The US customs and border protection agency on Friday published a list of 20 product categories, including smartphones, laptops and semiconductor devices that would be exempted from the tariff. This meant that such products from China would be subject to a tariff of 20 per cent instead of 145 per cent. Last year, China supplied more than two thirds of the smartphones, laptops and PC monitors imported into the US and the exempted products account for almost 25 per cent of Chinese exports to the country. Beijing noted that this was the second change Trump had made to his tariff regime after he postponed \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on most countries last week. \u201cThis can be seen as a small step toward correcting its erroneous unilateral practice of \u2018reciprocal tariffs\u2019,\u201d China\u2019s commerce ministry said. Mr Trump blamed the media for giving a misleading impression of Friday\u2019s announcement, posting on his Truth Social website that nobody is getting off the hook of tariffs. \u201cWe are taking a look at semiconductors and the whole electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like China.\u201d Applying a separate, national security tariff to Chinese electronics imports could still represent a reprieve for companies like Apple and Dell if it is set at 25 per cent, as some speculation in Washington suggests. Mr Trump and Mr Lutnick made clear that such products were moving into a separate tariff \u201cbucket\u201d so they would not face the 125 per cent \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d imposed on other Chinese imports, although they would still be subject to a separate, 20 per cent import levy Mr Trump imposed on China earlier this year. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping started a three-country tour of south-east Asia on Monday with a two-day state visit to Vietnam before he moves on to Malaysia and Cambodia. Writing in Vietnam\u2019s Nhan Dan newspaper on Monday, he called for closer co-operation between China and Vietnam on industry and supply chains and in strengthening the multilateral trading system. \u201cThere are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation.

Yes, please! Photo: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac The Vision Pro 2 might pack more upgrades than previously rumored. Instead of a minor spec bump, Apple could make the headset lighter and cheaper. This would address two of the biggest complaints with Apple\u2019s first mixed-reality headset. Vision Pro 2 could pack bigger upgrades than anticipated Despite packing impressive cutting-edge hardware and innovative capabilities, the Vision Pro failed to click with consumers. This is not surprising since the first iteration of the headset seemed to target developers more. Its steep $3,500 price tag, bulky design and limited use cases did not help either. While the Vision Pro did not sell in huge numbers, rumors suggest Apple could refresh the headset later this year. It would seemingly be a minor update, replacing the M1 chip with a faster M5 SoC. However, a new report claims Apple may be planning bigger changes now. Following recent changes to Siri\u2019s leadership team , Apple no longer has a Vision Products Group. Instead, Mike Rockwell \u2014 now also leading the Siri team \u2014 looks after the Vision Pro\u2019s software engineering. Paul Meade and others look after the hardware aspects of the headset, reporting directly to John Ternus. These changes bring the Vision Pro\u2019s development in line with other Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad. The new leadership wants to make bigger changes to the Vision Pro 2 headset than initially planned. In this weekly Power On newsletter , Bloomberg \u2018s Mark Gurman reveals, \u201cthe new plan is to release a model that makes the headset both lighter and cheaper.\u201d However, it\u2019s unclear how the company will achieve this. A lower price could force Apple to use cheaper components on the Vision Pro 2, negatively affecting the overall experience.

It\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint,\u201d reveals one of Gurman\u2019s sources.

Historically, they have indeed been precious metals. However, they are not the only ones. There are elemental metals that are rarer and more expensive than gold. They have important industrial uses\u2026.and in some cases, they are much more expensive. Learn more about platinum, palladium, and rhodium, the other precious metals, on this episode of Everything Everywhere Daily. I\u2019ve previously done episodes on both gold and silver. Most of you are familiar with gold and silver, and there is a good chance many of you own at least a little in the form of jewelry, coins, or silverware. Silver and gold are two of the seven metals that were known in the ancient world, the others being iron, lead, copper, tin, and mercury. Gold and silver were *the* precious metals for thousands of years. However, starting in the 18th century, scientists began discovering a whole host of new elements, including new metals. In this episode, I\u2019m going to focus on three metals: platinum, palladium, and rhodium. There are other metals which some might consider precious, including rhenium, osmium, and iridium. However, by the end of this episode, you\u2019ll see why I\u2019ve decided to focus on these three elements. I\u2019m guessing that most of you have heard of platinum, some of you have heard of palladium, and most of you probably don\u2019t have a clue what rhodium is. All three of these metals are in the platinum group of elements on the periodic table, along with ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. Before I get into what they have in common and their primary use, I\u2019d like to go through the history of each metal. The first known use of platinum predates European awareness by centuries. Indigenous peoples in pre-Columbian South America, particularly in what is now Colombia and Ecuador, worked with platinum-like alloys as early as 600 BC. Archaeologists have uncovered jewelry and artifacts composed of a naturally occurring mixture of platinum, gold, and other platinum group metals. However, due to platinum\u2019s high melting point and chemical inertness, these ancient artisans did not isolate it but instead used native metal alloys found in alluvial river deposits. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the 16th century, they encountered these mysterious white metals in the rivers of New Granada, or modern-day Colombia. The Spanish called the metal platina , meaning \u201clittle silver,\u201d viewing it as an impurity mixed with gold. They considered it a nuisance and even discarded it. Some records suggest they tried to artificially transmute platinum into gold, unaware of its distinct properties. Platina is the root of the word platinum. Despite this early encounter, platinum remained unappreciated and misunderstood in Europe for nearly two centuries. Platinum entered the scientific consciousness in the 18th century. Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish naval officer and scientist, is often credited with introducing platinum to Europe. In 1735, during a scientific expedition to South America, he observed the metal and brought samples back to Spain. His report, published in 1748, drew the attention of chemists and mineralogists across Europe. In the mid-18th century, William Brownrigg and Charles Wood conducted early studies of platinum in England. They noted its high melting point and resistance to corrosion, key traits that hinted at its future usefulness. In France, chemist Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Chabaneau made significant progress in refining platinum by the 1780s. He was among the first to succeed in producing malleable platinum by painstakingly removing impurities such as iron, gold, and other platinum group metals, allowing it to be shaped and used for practical purposes. In 1803, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston discovered a more efficient method for purifying platinum using aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride. Platinum, along with the other metals in the platinum group, as well as gold, are often called noble metals because they are very resistant to corrosion. Despite its scarcity, platinum gained traction in coinage and jewelry in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Russia, under the reign of Tsar Nicholas I, platinum rubles were minted between 1828 and 1845. These were the first major coins made from platinum, using Russian reserves from the Ural Mountains, where platinum had been discovered in the early 1800s. In the decorative arts, platinum\u2019s bright luster and resistance to tarnish made it a favorite among jewelers, especially in the Edwardian and Art Deco periods. Its strength allows for intricate designs that securely hold gemstones, which makes it highly desirable in high-end jewelry. Platinum is slightly more common in the Earth\u2019s crust than gold, having an abundance of 5 parts per billion. It has the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is silver, dense, malleable, and non-corrosive. As of the recording of this episode, platinum had a spot price of $948.00 USD per ounce, although it has reached as high as $1300 per ounce. Palladium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston the guy who is credited with the discovery of the purification of Platinum. Wollaston was working on refining platinum ore from South America using aqua regia to dissolve the platinum and then chemically separating other elements from the solution. While experimenting, Wollaston identified a new metal with distinct properties. To confirm its novelty and avoid public skepticism, he first anonymously offered samples for sale in a London mineral shop under the name \u201cpalladium,\u201d after the recently discovered asteroid Pallas, which itself had been named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athena. Only later did Wollaston reveal himself as the discoverer. Although initially met with some controversy and disbelief, because the scientific community was suspicious of anonymous claims, the uniqueness of palladium was eventually confirmed. Over time, it was accepted as a new element and added to the growing catalog of metallic elements essential to chemistry and metallurgy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, palladium was occasionally used in jewelry, often alloyed with gold to create \u201cwhite gold.\u201d Its brightness and tarnish resistance made it a preferred material for fine settings and wedding bands. It was used in coinage as well, primarily in commemorative or bullion coins issued by countries like Russia, Canada, and Sierra Leone. Palladium is more plentiful than platinum at 15 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust. It has the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46. Its properties are very similar to those of platinum. As of the recording of this episode, palladium had a spot price of $903 per ounce, with a peak over $3200 per ounce. Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, the year after he discovered Palladium. He discovered it by analyzing the same samples of platinum ore, imported from South America, using the same techniques he used to discover palladium. After removing platinum and palladium from the solution, Wollaston noticed a rose-colored compound remaining in the residue. Through further analysis, he isolated a new, previously unknown element. He named it rhodium, derived from the Greek word rhodon , meaning \u201crose,\u201d in reference to the pinkish color of its chloride salt, rhodium chloride. Rhodium\u2019s chemical symbol is Rh, and its atomic number is 45. It is extremely rare, estimated at about 0.7 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust, rarer than gold or platinum. Rhodium is one of the most reflective metals known, making it ideal for mirrors and coatings. Like the other platinum group metals, it is corrosion-resistant, resisting attacks from most acids and atmospheric elements. It is also not rose colored as it is named, in its base metal form. Rhodium is not mined directly. It is obtained almost exclusively as a byproduct of platinum and nickel mining, which limits its supply. As of the recording of this episode, rhodium has a spot price of $5,250 per ounce, making it one of the most expensive elements regularly used in industry. It has reached prices as high as $27,000 an ounce. All three of these metals have similar properties: they are rare, silvery, and non-corrosive. However, they also share another attribute: they all have catalytic properties. They can accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed. In particular, all three of these rare and expensive metals are used in catalytic converters in automobiles. Catalytic converters are pollution control devices installed in vehicle exhaust systems that transform harmful emissions into less dangerous substances. These devices represent one of the most significant advances in automotive environmental technology since the 1970s. At its core, a catalytic converter functions through chemical reactions that occur when exhaust gases pass through its structure. These reactions don\u2019t happen spontaneously at exhaust temperatures, which is why catalysts are necessary\u2014they enable these chemical transformations without being consumed. The primary reactions occurring within a catalytic converter include oxidation reactions, which add oxygen to molecules like carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and reduction reactions, which remove oxygen from nitrogen oxide compounds. Through oxidation, carbon monoxide becomes carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Through reduction, nitrogen oxides break down into separate nitrogen and oxygen molecules. A catalytic converter\u2019s structure consists of several carefully engineered layers. At the center is the substrate or core, typically made from ceramic material formed into a honeycomb pattern. This design creates thousands of tiny channels through which exhaust gases flow. The honeycomb structure maximizes surface area within a compact space. When all the microscopic pores are considered, a modern catalytic converter can contain a surface area equivalent to several football fields. Some high-performance vehicles use metallic substrates instead, which offer better durability under extreme temperature conditions. The washcoat, a layer approximately 20-150 micrometers thick and composed primarily of aluminum oxide, covers this substrate. This washcoat serves multiple purposes: It increases the surface area even further, provides a suitable surface for catalyst adhesion, and can include additional components that enhance catalytic activity. The rough, porous nature of the washcoat creates an environment where gas molecules and catalytic sites can interact effectively. The actual catalyst materials are embedded within this washcoat. Platinum is an excellent oxidation catalyst, facilitating the conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into less harmful substances. Palladium performs similar functions to platinum and has become increasingly important as platinum prices have fluctuated. Rhodium specializes in the reduction side, helping to break down nitrogen oxides. These precious metals are used in extremely small quantities\u2014typically just a few grams per converter\u2014but their effect is profound. Temperature plays a crucial role in catalytic converter operation. These devices require heat to function properly, generally becoming effective above approximately 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). When a car is just being started, before the converter reaches this temperature, emissions are significantly higher. This has led to various strategies in modern vehicles, including positioning converters closer to the engine, using electric heating elements, or incorporating specialized materials that become active at lower temperatures. Not surprisingly, catalytic converter theft has become a significant and growing problem worldwide due to the high value of the precious metals they contain. These metals can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars per ounce on the black market, making catalytic converters attractive targets for thieves. The devices are relatively easy to remove from vehicles\u2019 undercarriages, often within minutes using basic tools. They also lack traceability, allowing stolen units to be quickly sold to unscrupulous scrap dealers. Hybrid vehicles, trucks, and SUVs are particularly vulnerable because they either contain higher quantities of these metals and/or have elevated frames that make access to the catalytic converters easier. It is possible to buy platinum and palladium bullion and jewelry. Platinum is more common as a metal for these purposes, but both can be found. Rhodium, because of its scarcity and price, is much harder to find, but it is possible if, for whatever reason, you wanted to own some. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium are all rare, expensive, shiny precious metals. However, that isn\u2019t why they are important. It is their unique chemical properties that make the elements in such demand, as they are largely responsible for the reduction in harmful emissions from automobiles.

U.S. President Donald Trump warned Sunday that no country would be \"getting off the hook\" on tariffs , as his administration suggested exemptions seen as favoring China would be short-lived. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a fast-moving, high-stakes game of brinkmanship since Trump launched a global tariff assault that particularly targeted Chinese imports. Tit-for-tat exchanges have seen U.S. levies imposed on China rise to 145 percent, and Beijing setting a retaliatory 125 percent band on U.S. imports. The U.S. side had appeared to dial down the pressure slightly on Friday, listing tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products for which China is a major source. Trump and some of his top aides said Sunday that the exemptions had been misconstrued and would only be temporary as his team pursued fresh tariffs against many items on the list. \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\" he posted on his Truth Social platform. Earlier, Beijing's Commerce Ministry had said Friday's move only \"represents a small step\" and insisted that the Trump administration should \"completely cancel\" the whole tariff strategy. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Monday \u2014 as he kicked off a tour of Southeast Asia with a visit to manufacturing powerhouse Vietnam \u2014 that protectionism \"will lead nowhere\". Writing in an article published in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi urged the two countries to \"resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.\" He also reiterated Beijing's line that a \"trade war and tariff war will produce no winner.\" Asian stock markets rose Monday after Trump's announcement of the tariff exemptions. Short-lived relief? Washington's new exemptions will benefit U.S. tech companies such as Nvidia and Dell as well as Apple, which makes iPhones and other premium products in China. The relief could, however, be short-lived with some of the exempted consumer electronics targeted for upcoming sector-specific tariffs on goods deemed key to U.S. national defense networks. On Air Force One Sunday, Trump said tariffs on the semiconductors \u2014 which powers any major technology from e-vehicles and iPhones to missile systems \u2014 \"will be in place in the not distant future.\" \"Like we did with steel, like we did with automobiles, like we did with aluminum... we'll be doing that with semiconductors, with chips and numerous other things,\" he said. \"We want to make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country,\" Trump reiterated, adding that he would do the same with \"drugs and pharmaceuticals.\" The U.S. president said he would announce tariffs rates for semiconductors \"over the next week,\" while his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said they would likely be in place \"in a month or two.\" The U.S. president sent financial markets into a tailspin earlier this month by announcing sweeping import taxes on dozens of trade partners, only to abruptly announce a 90-day pause for most of them. China was excluded from the reprieve. The White House says Trump remains optimistic about securing a deal with China, although administration officials have made it clear they expect Beijing to reach out first. Trump's trade representative Jamieson Greer told CBS \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"we don't have any plans\" for talks between the U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart Xi. China looks elsewhere China has sought to present itself as a stable alternative to an erratic Washington, courting countries spooked by the global economic storm. Xi warned that protectionism \"leads nowhere\" and that a trade war would have \"no winners\", state media said, as he arrived in Vietnam. Besides Vietnam, Xi will also visit Malaysia and Cambodia, seeking to tighten regional trade ties and with plans to meet his three Southeast Asian counterparts. The fallout from Trump's tariffs \u2014 and subsequent whiplash policy reversals \u2014 has sent particular shockwaves through the U.S. economy, with investors dumping government bonds, the dollar tumbling and consumer confidence plunging. Adding to the pressure on Trump, Wall Street billionaires \u2014 including a number of his own supporters \u2014 have openly criticized the tariff strategy as damaging and counterproductive. The White House insists the aggressive policy is bearing fruit, saying dozens of countries have already opened trade negotiations to secure a deal before the 90-day pause ends. \"We're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries,\" Greer told CBS.

Meanwhile, the iOS 18.5 beta introduces subtle design changes, such as updates to the Apple Care and Warranty section. While these tweaks improve usability, the absence of the highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features has left some users disappointed. Many had hoped for more significant advancements, raising questions about when these features will finally be introduced. iOS 19: A Glimpse Into the Future Looking ahead, iOS 19 is generating considerable excitement among Apple enthusiasts. Rumors suggest that Apple is planning a major overhaul of Siri , focusing on enhanced personalization capabilities. This update could enable Siri to deliver more tailored responses, adapting to individual user preferences and integrating seamlessly with advanced tools like photo editing features. Such improvements would mark a significant step forward in making Siri a more intuitive and versatile assistant. In addition to functional upgrades, iOS 19 is rumored to adopt a VisionOS-inspired design , featuring rounded icons and a more immersive interface. These aesthetic changes are expected to align with Apple\u2019s evolving design philosophy, creating a more cohesive and visually appealing user experience. If these updates come to fruition, iOS 19 could set a new benchmark for software design and functionality across Apple\u2019s ecosystem. With a potential release in the fall, anticipation is building for what could be one of Apple\u2019s most fantastic updates in recent years. WhatsApp and ChatGPT: Enhancing Everyday Tools Beyond iOS updates, popular apps like WhatsApp and ChatGPT are introducing significant improvements for Apple users. WhatsApp has rolled out several new features designed to enhance communication and productivity, including: Group chat online indicators for better visibility of active participants Enhanced video call functionality, improving the quality and reliability of virtual interactions Document scanning capabilities, streamlining the process of digitizing important files These updates make WhatsApp an even more versatile tool for both personal and professional use. Meanwhile, ChatGPT has expanded its memory capabilities , allowing it to reference past conversations for a more personalized experience. This development aligns with the growing demand for AI-powered tools that adapt to individual preferences. By integrating artificial intelligence more deeply into daily workflows, ChatGPT is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for users seeking efficiency and customization in their digital interactions. Apple Product Leaks and Ecosystem Evolution Speculation about upcoming Apple products continues to generate excitement. Reports suggest that production for the Vision Pro 2 is already underway, hinting at an earlier-than-expected launch. This next-generation device is expected to build on the innovations of its predecessor, further advancing Apple\u2019s ambitions in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Meanwhile, leaks about the iPhone 17 Pro have sparked discussions about potential design changes. While rumors of a two-tone back design have been debunked, reports indicate a larger camera bump, possibly to accommodate improved imaging technology. These developments suggest that Apple is prioritizing advancements in photography and videography, areas where it has consistently led the industry. In addition, WatchOS may soon adopt a VisionOS-inspired aesthetic , signaling Apple\u2019s broader push to unify its ecosystem. This design shift reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to creating a seamless user experience across devices, particularly as it explores new possibilities in AR and VR integration. Supply Chain Shifts and Tariff Impacts Apple is making significant changes to its supply chain, shifting a portion of its production to India . This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing while mitigating the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. By diversifying its manufacturing base, Apple aims to enhance the resilience of its supply chain and navigate geopolitical challenges more effectively. While some analysts have speculated that this shift could lead to price increases for Apple products, substantial hikes are unlikely in the short term. Apple\u2019s focus remains on maintaining competitive pricing while making sure the quality and availability of its products. This strategic relocation underscores the company\u2019s commitment to adapting to global economic conditions while safeguarding its market position. Other Noteworthy Developments Apple continues to expand its ecosystem with new tools and features designed to enhance user experiences. The recently released Apple Immersive Video Utility app allows users to manage Vision Pro media more effectively, catering to the growing demand for AR and VR content. This tool reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to supporting its innovative hardware with robust software solutions. On the social media front, Instagram is testing a feature that requires secret codes to access certain Reels, adding an element of exclusivity to content sharing. This experimental feature could reshape how users engage with content on the platform, emphasizing privacy and selectivity. In the realm of home automation, Apple\u2019s Smart Home Hub has been delayed until 2026 due to engineering challenges related to Siri. This delay underscores the complexities of integrating advanced AI into smart home systems, highlighting the technical hurdles that must be overcome to deliver a seamless and reliable user experience. Despite these challenges, Apple remains committed to advancing its smart home initiatives, making sure that its ecosystem continues to evolve in line with user needs.

Seriens producenter Megan Ganz, David Hornsby och Rob McElhenney s\u00e4ger i ett uttalande om att Mythic Quest nu l\u00e4ggs ner: \"Endings are hard.

Jag hatar innerligt uttryck som Teslad\u00f6dare. Men det h\u00e4r kan vara en. Eller den f\u00f6rsta av m\u00e5nga. Och det \u00e4r bra f\u00f6r alla. Tesla, och i Sverige framf\u00f6rallt Model Y, har under m\u00e5nga \u00e5r varit det slutgiltiga svaret p\u00e5 vilken elbil man ska k\u00f6pa om man bara vill ha en bil som kryssar i s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga rutor som det bara g\u00e5r. Som kanske inte \u00e4r b\u00e4st p\u00e5 allt men som \u00e4r bra p\u00e5 det mesta. TL;DR Zeekr levererar en riktigt trevlig suv som sl\u00e5r det mesta p\u00e5 fingrarna, inklusive Tesla. Man levererar mer och b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 (n\u00e4stan) allt till en riktigt bra prislapp. Det \u00f6ppna m\u00e5l som Tesla har haft under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r \u00e4r nu officiellt st\u00e4ngt. F\u00f6r konkurrenterna har under alla \u00e5r kunnat vara bra p\u00e5 n\u00e5got, men inte p\u00e5 allt. D\u00e4r har Tesla varit b\u00e4st. Bra laddning (och framf\u00f6rallt n\u00e4tverk), gott om utrymmet, bra teknik \u00f6verlag, bra teknik i bilen, bra r\u00e4ckvidd och s\u00e5 vidare. Sen har Model Y varit en otroligt tr\u00e5kig bil att k\u00f6ra, men det har f\u00e5tt st\u00e5 undan n\u00e4r allt annat varit s\u00e5 bra. Tesla har ocks\u00e5 varit bra p\u00e5 att leverera detta till en, i elbilsv\u00e4rlden, vettig prislapp. Anonym rumpa utan loggor Men nu \u00e4r det slut p\u00e5 Teslas dominans. Kineserna, och i viss m\u00e5n europ\u00e9erna, har kommit i kapp, och nu \u00e4ven f\u00f6rbi. Den f\u00f6rsta bilen som visar detta p\u00e5 riktigt h\u00e4r i Sverige \u00e4r Zeekr 7X. Zeekr 7X \u00e4r suv-versionen av en modell som heter Zeekr 007 som aldrig kom hit men som finns i Kina. Eller det verkar som att kombiversionen faktiskt kommer hit, d\u00e5 under namnet Zeekr 7 GT. 35.4\u00b0 0 Jobbar du hemifr\u00e5n?

I serien f\u00e5r vi f\u00f6lja n\u00e5gra av de sista \u00f6verlevande m\u00e4nniskorna efter en zombieapokalyps med ett s\u00e4rskilt fokus p\u00e5 Joel (Pedro Pascal) och Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Den nya s\u00e4songen utspelar sig fem \u00e5r efter seriens f\u00f6rsta s\u00e4song. Joel och den 19-\u00e5riga Ellie h\u00e4nger fortfarande ihop, men relationen \u00e4r anstr\u00e4ngd efter att Joel tidigare f\u00f6rt Ellie bakom ljuset. I den nya s\u00e4songen introduceras \u00e4ven karakt\u00e4ren Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), som har en del otalt med Joel att g\u00f6ra upp, n\u00e5got som b\u00e4ddar f\u00f6r nya konflikter.

Det \u00e4r en restomoddad Giulia d\u00e4r i princip bara formerna finns kvar, allt annat \u00e4r uppdaterat och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrat. En sak kvarst\u00e5r dock - k\u00f6rgl\u00e4djen.

Tanken bakom N1 \u00e4r bland annat att den ska locka fler utvecklare till robotbranschen. Fourier N1 \u00e4r 130 centimeter l\u00e5ng och v\u00e4ger 38 kg. Den kan r\u00f6ra sig fram\u00e5t i en hastighet p\u00e5 3,5 meter i sekunden, n\u00e5got som motsvarar cirka 12,5 km/h. Batteriet ska r\u00e4cka f\u00f6r drift i cirka tv\u00e5 timmar. Hela robotens design \u00e4r \u00f6ppen att ta del av och f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra under open source-licens. Det inneb\u00e4r att det kommer att bli m\u00f6jligt att ladda hem designen av roboten, vilka komponenter och material som anv\u00e4nts f\u00f6r att bygga den samt mjukvaran som driver roboten. I videoklippet nedan kan ni kolla in lite av vad Fourier N1 klarar av i sin grunddesign. 38.8\u00b0 0 Toshiba har gjort en b\u00e4rbar skivspelare Ta med dig dina LP-skivor med Aurex AX-RP10 Toshiba ger sig in i segmentet d\u00e4r vi hittar bland annat Audio-Technicas Sound Burger med nya Aurex AX-RP10, som \u00e4r en ny portabel skivspelare designad f\u00f6r vinylentusiaster som vill g\u00f6ra sina analoga musiksamlingar mer b\u00e4rbara. Aurex \u00e4r tillr\u00e4ckligt kompakt f\u00f6r att b\u00e4ras i en medf\u00f6ljande axelremsv\u00e4ska och klarar av att spela fullstora 12-tumsskivor. Den laddas med USB-C och har ett inbyggt batteri med upp till 10 timmars speltid. AX-RP10 spelar skivor i b\u00e5de 33 1/3 och 45 varv per minut, anv\u00e4nder MM-pickuper och \u00e4r remdriven. Den saknar inbyggda h\u00f6gtalare men erbjuder b\u00e5de en 3,5 mm ljudutg\u00e5ng f\u00f6r anslutning av h\u00f6rlurar eller en extern ljudanl\u00e4ggning, samt Bluetooth f\u00f6r tr\u00e5dl\u00f6s koppling till h\u00f6rlurar och h\u00f6gtalare. Vad priset kommer att hamna p\u00e5 vet vi inte \u00e4nnu, men skivspelaren f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas b\u00f6rja levereras n\u00e5gon g\u00e5ng nu under april. 37.5\u00b0 0 Polestar verkar dra ner i Kina Avbryter samarbete med Meizu Polestar m\u00e5 vara en produkt sprungen ur Volvo, men mycket fokus har legat p\u00e5 Kina f\u00f6r varum\u00e4rket. Man har i princip all tillverkning d\u00e4r, f\u00f6rutom Polestar 3 som ocks\u00e5 ska tillverkas i USA. Man har \u00e4ven teknikcenter i Nanjing. Men det g\u00e5r s\u00e5d\u00e4r med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljningen, man s\u00e5lde bara drygt 3000 bilar i Kina under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Totalt s\u00e5lde man 44.850 bilar. Det ska dock s\u00e4gas att Polestar 4, som nog fr\u00e4mst \u00e4r den modell som kan fungera i Kina, kom f\u00f6rst i slutet av \u00e5ret. Nu verkar man dra ner p\u00e5 fokuset p\u00e5 landet. Om man vill k\u00f6pa en Polestar s\u00e5 finns det fortfarande 36 st\u00e4llen att bes\u00f6ka enligt hemsidan, men i appen ska det bara finnas tio platser att provk\u00f6ra. Tio st\u00e4llen \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt lite \u00e4ven i Sverige. Man har \u00e4ven avslutat samarbetet med Meizu som man har haft ett tag. Det resulterade bland annat i en mobiltelefon, men Meizu har \u00e4ven hj\u00e4lpt till med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljning och kundservice. Om man drar ner p\u00e5 riktigt eller om man t\u00e4nker ta nya tag fram\u00f6ver \u00e4r oklart. 37.5\u00b0 0 Mercedes T-Klass och Citan s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt L\u00e4ggs ner V\u00e5ren 2022 lanserade Mercedes den nya modellen T-Klass som \u00e4r en liten minibuss. Det \u00e4r en slags m\u00e4nnisko-version av den befintliga modellen Citan som \u00e4r en klassisk hantverkarbil. Nu l\u00e4ggs b\u00e4gge modellerna ner f\u00f6r att de s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt.

Galaxy XCover7 Pro \u00e4r utrustad med ett batteri p\u00e5 4350 mAh som kan bytas ut enkelt av anv\u00e4ndaren. Surfplattan Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro har ett st\u00f6rre batteri p\u00e5 10.100 mAh med unik Dual Hot-Swap-funktionalitet som till\u00e5ter batteribyte under drift utan att st\u00e4nga av enheten, samt ett \"No Battery Mode\" f\u00f6r drift via fast str\u00f6mk\u00e4lla.

Upon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets.

Tanken bakom designen p\u00e5 sadeln \"VabsRider\" \u00e4r att den ska kunna r\u00f6ra sig i takt med att cyklisten trampar p\u00e5 pedalerna, n\u00e5got som f\u00f6retaget s\u00e4ger ska minska risken f\u00f6r sm\u00e4rtor.

If you donx27t want a part of your body to get sore, then that part shouldnx27t be pushing against something that doesnx27t move along with it. Thatx27s the thinking behind the vabsRider bicycle saddle.\" Sadeln ska passa p\u00e5 de flesta cykelmodeller och kunna justeras individuellt med hj\u00e4lp av olika inst\u00e4llningar.

Alla som sett serien Severance p\u00e5 Apple TV+ har nog \u00e5tminstone funderat p\u00e5 hur det hade varit att ha ett av tangentborden och arbetsstationerna fr\u00e5n serien. Snart beh\u00f6ver du inte undra l\u00e4nge. F\u00f6retaget Atomic Keyboard ska n\u00e4mligen sl\u00e4ppa MDR Dasher Keyboard, som \u00e4r ett nytt tangentbord som h\u00e4mtat stark inspiration fr\u00e5n serien. Designen \u00e4r en n\u00e4ra replika av de retro-terminaler som anv\u00e4nds p\u00e5 den fiktiva arbetsplatsen Lumon Industries, som i sin tur \u00e4r baserade p\u00e5 verklighetens Data General Dasher-terminaler fr\u00e5n 70- och 80-talet. Tangentbordet har en kompakt 70-procent-layout med 73 tangenter i bl\u00e5tt och vitt, ett chassi i aluminium samt en optisk styrkula placerad p\u00e5 h\u00f6ger sida. Den mest anm\u00e4rkningsv\u00e4rda designdetaljen \u00e4r dock att tangentbordet saknar Escape-, Control- och Option-tangenter, som en blinkning till seriens teman om inst\u00e4ngdhet och brist p\u00e5 kontroll. MDR Dasher riktar sig d\u00e4rf\u00f6r fr\u00e4mst till samlare och stora fans av serien.

En som kom p\u00e5 ett ganska s\u00e5 kul lur var Youtubern Fabian Svorono. Han kokade ihop att Tesla hade k\u00f6pt hamburgerkedjan Max. Han hyrde tv\u00e5 Teslor, parkerade dessa utanf\u00f6r en Max-restaurang i Stockholm, gjorde rollups och delade ut gratis kaffe till f\u00f6rbipasserande.

Kronkursen fortsatte att st\u00e4rkas mot dollarn under dagen och i skrivande stund kostar en dollar 9,66 kronor. Det kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med att en dollar kostade 11,07 kronor vid \u00e5rsskiftet, n\u00e5got som inneb\u00e4r att kronkursen har \u00f6kat med \u00f6ver 14 procent j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med dollarn sedan dess. En euro kostar nu 10,98 kronor vilket kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med de 11,45 kronor euron kostade vid \u00e5rsskiftet, en \u00f6kning f\u00f6r kronan med lite \u00f6ver 4 procent. Anledningen till att kronan har st\u00e4rkts den senaste tiden verkar bero p\u00e5 att investerare anser att kronan \u00e4r en n\u00e5gorlunda trygg valuta, n\u00e5got som vanligtvis inte \u00e4r fallet. Robert Bergqvist, SEB:s seniorekonom, s\u00e4ger till TT: \u2013 Det \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt ovanligt det vi ser nu. N\u00e4r det \u00e4r st\u00f6kigt och oroliga tider brukar man ist\u00e4llet s\u00f6ka sig bort fr\u00e5n de mindre valutorna som till exempel den svenska kronan. \u2013 Men nu har det h\u00e4r m\u00f6nstret f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrats. Nu har det n\u00e4stan blivit tv\u00e4rtom. Det vill s\u00e4ga att dollarn har blivit en cyklisk valuta, som tappar n\u00e4r oron \u00f6kar. Medan kronan har blivit en s\u00e5 kallad defensiv valuta som m\u00e5nga s\u00f6ker till f\u00f6r trygghet. 61.0\u00b0 0 SVT tidigarel\u00e4gger Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen Drar ig\u00e5ng i natt SVT meddelade idag att man kommer att b\u00f6rja s\u00e4nda sin slow-tv-show Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen en vecka tidigare \u00e4n planerat. Anledningen till tidigarel\u00e4ggningen av programmet beror p\u00e5 att v\u00e4rmen gjort att \u00e4lgarna redan har b\u00f6rjat vandra, n\u00e5got som tvingat SVT att g\u00f6ra en \u00e4ndring i sitt s\u00e4ndningsprogram. Stefan Edlund, producent av Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen, s\u00e4ger: \u2013 Det \u00e4r full trafik av \u00e4lgar. De st\u00e5r och v\u00e4ntar p\u00e5 oss.

Den f\u00f6rsta varianten av Vision Pro, som lanserades i USA i februari f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret, kostar fortfarande fr\u00e5n 500 dollar och v\u00e4ger cirka 680 gram. Ut\u00f6ver den l\u00e4ttare och billigare modellen uppger Gurman att Apple \u00e4ven utvecklar en annan version av Vision Pro som ska kunna anslutas med kabel direkt till en Mac-dator. Syftet med detta \u00e4r att skapa en upplevelse med extremt l\u00e5g f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Med detta skulle man kunna f\u00f6rlita sig b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 kr\u00e4vande professionella applikationer genom att str\u00f6mma Mac-sk\u00e4rmen eller anv\u00e4nda headsetet f\u00f6r exempelvis kirurgisk bildvisning eller i flygsimulatorer.

Handlingen kretsar runt hur Godzilla vaknar upp och hotar att f\u00f6rst\u00f6ra v\u00e4rlden. Efter att Marvel-hj\u00e4ltarna inte lyckas besegra besten p\u00e5 egen hand tvingas de kalla in n\u00e5gra av jordens v\u00e4rsta superskurkar f\u00f6r att tillsammans f\u00f6rs\u00f6ka ge Godzilla en match.

Totalt ska det handla om 250.000 ton utsl\u00e4ppsminskning som tillfaller Sverige fram till 2030, det motsvarar cirka 2 procent av utsl\u00e4ppen som uppstod fr\u00e5n bilk\u00f6rning i Sverige under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Det kommer att kosta 400 kronor per ton utsl\u00e4ppsminskning.

Han skriver att \u00e4ven om vi inte kommer att f\u00e5 riktiga macOS p\u00e5 iPad, s\u00e5 kommer f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna att vara tillr\u00e4ckligt stora f\u00f6r att tillfredsst\u00e4lla de anv\u00e4ndare som l\u00e4nge \u00f6nskat en mer Mac-liknande upplevelse p\u00e5 iPad.

However, the chip sector faced headwinds due to national security concerns. This exemption raised hopes for improved trade relations, supported by better-than-expected loan data and anticipated policy support. AP China and Hong Kong stocks rebounded on Monday, fueled by gains in tech shares after the U.S. exempted smartphones and computers from tariffs. China and Hong Kong stocks rose on Monday as tech shares climbed after the White House exempted smartphones and computers from \"reciprocal\" U.S. tariffs, while the chip sector was weighed down by national security concerns . China's blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.5%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9% by the midday trading break, after losing 2.9% and 3.1% last week, respectively. Hong Kong benchmark's Hang Seng climbed 2.4% after an 8.5% loss last week. The Hang Seng Tech Index added 2.7%. Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China, while indicating these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed within a month. China's Apple suppliers jumped on the temporary relief. The CSI Electronics Index jumped 0.9% by midday. Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn Industrial Internet rallied 1.1%, and acoustic components manufacturer Goertek jumped 2.5%. Live Events Keeping a lid on gains, the CSI Semiconductor Index declined as much as 0.9% after Trump said that chips from China will face a national security probe over the next week. The news of the exemption \"fuels expectation of potential improvement in trade relations, and even the prospect of trade negotiations,\" said Li Shuding, an investor adviser of Galaxy Securities. He added that March loan data was better than expected, and \"we expect intensive roll-out of policies\" to support the economy. Before Monday's rebound, the CSI 300 Index and Hang Seng Index had lost 3.5% and 9.9%, respectively, since \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. Trump threatened to implement sweeping tariffs against trading partners with China being the major target, raising concerns about slowing global economic growth and disruptions to trade. Goldman Sachs has revised its 12-month targets for MSCI China and the CSI300 Index, lowering them to 75 and 4,300, respectively, down from previous estimates of 81 and 4,500, respectively. \" U.S.-China trade tensions have soared to unprecedented levels, prompting concerns about global recession, and decoupling risks between the two largest economies globally in other strategic cohorts, notably capital markets, technology, and geopolitics,\" China strategist Kinger Lau said in a note on Monday. Elsewhere, China's exports in March rose 12.4% from a year earlier, handily beating 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect.

Last week, it was learnt that the carmaker rolled out the Flyme Auto S version 1.1.4 firmware update for a host of fixes . According to a presentation slide that was photographed, the over-the-air updates are pushed to customer vehicles on a quarterly basis. Completed so far as of its April OTA update are charging start/stop button, optimised braking and the ability for owners to view the vehicle\u2019s location when it is asleep. The next update set for the second quarter of this year, to be rolled out approximately in July, will include wireless Apple CarPlay, switchable \u201cice-cream van\u201d sound , access to third-party apps, radio scanning fix, as well as other to-be-announced improvements. This will be followed by updates scheduled for Q3 2025, to be released approximately in October. These will include wired Apple CarPlay, a memory function for speed warning switching, and other improvements. Wrapping up the updates timeline in Q4 2025 in December will be wired and wireless Android Auto, along with other updates. Launched towards the end of last year, the Proton eMas 7 made its debut with two variants \u2013 Prime and Premium \u2013 each with a front-mounted electric motor producing 218 PS and 320 Nm. This propels Proton\u2019s first electric SUV from 0-100 km/h in 6.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 175 km/h. The Prime starts the range with a 49.52 kWh battery offering 345 km of range while the Premium brings a 60.022 kWh unit that is good for 410 km (both on the WLTP testing standard), and both are the Geely Aegis short-blade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. Charging the eMas 7 from 30 to 80% takes 20 minutes using DC fast charging at up to 100 kW with the Premium (80 kW for the Prime), while a full charge using an 11 kW AC wallbox takes 4.9 hours for the Prime and 6.1 hours for the Premium. The eMas 7 is also the first Proton to get a suite of driver assistance features, including Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities. Looking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro .

By Debby Wu, Josh Wingrove, and Shawn Donnan, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:03 IST Photo Credit: Apple Trump\u2019s tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks Highlights The exclusions were published late Friday US Customs and Border Protection published the exclusions The move is the first major softening of any kind in Trump\u2019s conflicts Advertisement President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, representing a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple and Nvidia even if it proves a temporary one. The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump's 125 percent China tariff and his baseline 10 percent global tariff on nearly all other countries. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren't made in the US. Apple Said to Have Airlifted 600 Tons of iPhones From India The pause will be welcome news to consumers, some of whom rushed to buy new iPhones and other devices amid fears that the tariffs would send prices soaring. It's also a big win for major technology companies that have presented massive US spending pledges for Trump in recent months. Trump's tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks and ignited a rapidly escalating trade war with China. The move is the first significant softening of any kind in Trump's conflict with China. It was backdated to April 5. The exemptions cover almost $390 billion (roughly Rs. 33,57,764 crore) in US imports based on official US 2024 trade statistics, including more than $101 billion (roughly Rs. 86,9,574 crore) from China, according to data compiled by Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the Rand China Research Center. Apple Exported $17 Billion in iPhones From India Last Year, Minister Says The biggest category related to China is smartphones. The US imported smartphones valued at more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 3,52,995 crore) from China in 2024, or about nine percent of total imports from China. Also covered are computers and similar devices, of which the US imported more than $36 billion (roughly Rs 3,09.947 crore) in 2024. Altogether the exemptions cover consumer electronics and semiconductors that accounted for about 22 percent of US imports from China in 2024, DiPippo said. \u201cThis is a large hole in the US tariff wall that will spare key firms like Apple and consumers of laptops and phones from sticker shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut many other consumer, intermediate, and capital goods from China still face prohibitively high US tariffs. This exemption only covers one segment of the US economy.\u201d Trump on Saturday declined to elaborate on the exemptions but hinted at further developments on Monday. \u201cI'll give you that answer on Monday. We'll be very specific on Monday,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cWe're taking in a lot of money; as a country we're taking in a lot of money.\u201d The White House also released a corresponding memo indicating that the exemptions also extend to changes in small-parcel shipping duties. Trump had moved to end the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, beginning with China, that generally means parcels worth $800 (roughly Rs. 68,880) or below don't face duties. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacturing critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cThat's why the president has secured trillions of dollars in US investments from the largest tech companies in the world.\u201d She said those companies are \u201chustling to onshore\u201d their manufacturing to the US. The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China. The products that won't be subject to Trump's new tariffs include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US, as well as other chipmakers. \u201cAll products that are properly classified in these listed provisions will be excluded from the reciprocal tariffs,\u201d the notice said. The move appeared to exclude the products from the 10 percent global baseline tariff on other countries, including Samsung Electronics' home of South Korea. The tariff reprieve does not extend to a separate Trump levy on China \u2014 a 20 percent duty applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl, including the shipment of precursor materials. Other previously existing levies, including those that predate Trump's current term, also appear unaffected. \u201cThe US tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House the reality of the situation was finally recognised in the Beltway,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Saturday. \u201cThere is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations.\u201d The original list of tariff exemptions included some semiconductor products \u2014 including central processing units known as CPUs. But those measures did not carve out tech products crucial to AI development including graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the servers that they power. Servers powered by AI chips from companies such as Nvidia and their critical components are primarily manufactured and assembled in Taiwan and Mexico. Friday's announcement would cover both Taiwanese and Mexican production, in a significant reprieve for companies seeking to build AI infrastructure in the US. Semiconductor Equipment Exemptions Also crucial are new exemptions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, made by companies such as ASML Holding NV in the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron Ltd. in Japan. Those tools are essential for building chip factories, and comprise the lion's share of the multibillion dollar price tag for such plants. Companies including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel Corp. are building new US facilities with support from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump's initial \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff announcement included exemptions for semiconductors and other sectors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn't yet done so but the latest exclusions are related to that exemption. The move excludes most of Apple's core products from the escalating tariffs on China, including iPhones, iPads and Apple watches. Apple shares have slid since Trump announced the tariffs. Discussions gained additional urgency in recent days after Trump increased the tariffs on China, putting companies like Apple in a more difficult position than competitors like Samsung, who are less reliant on China. Companies and tech industry lobbyists have also argued that reshoring the final assembly of smartphones and other products is impossible, one person familiar with the discussions said. But the move also is aimed at laying the groundwork for new targeted sectoral tariffs that are likely to hit the industry. The administration is expected to soon launch a new investigation into imports of semiconductors. That would eventually lead to the imposition of tariffs on chips within weeks or months. Those duties, like ones imposed recently on steel and aluminum, are likely to impose duties on products that include semiconductors as well as the chips themselves. Trump's sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25 percent, though it's not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be. It's also not clear how widely he would apply that tariff. Representatives from Nvidia and ASML declined to comment. Spokesmen for Tokyo Electron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The US International Trade Commission declined to comment on the exemptions, while the US Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce didn't respond to requests for comment. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Bureau Updated Apr 14, 2025, 10:59 AM IST iPhone maker Foxconn plans to expand in India, create jobs The Uttar Pradesh government is reportedly in talks with iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to set up a new facility in the Greater Noida region. According to sources, UP government officials and representatives of the Taiwanese company have already held two rounds of meetings at Delhi and Lucknow on the proposed project. The new facility is likely to centre around mobile phone manufacturing.

The facility is proposed to be set up on around 300-acres of land. It would be in addition to the 50-acre joint venture project that Foxconn has with HCL for an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility, sources said. Meanwhile, reports from earlier in the year had indicated that HCL-Foxconn joint venture, which is separate from this new plant, has begun talks with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as well as Taiwanese major CTCI for the semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) facility. The JV is also awaiting Cabinet approval. Foxconn is reportedly investing $37.2 million to hold a 40 per cent stake in the venture. The new facility is expected to create 40,000 jobs and will include residences for all workers inside the complex. Sources added that the UP government was interested in the project as the Noida-Greater Noida region already accounts for nearly 50 per cent of all mobile phone exports from the country. \u201cThere is no better place than UP to have a facility for Apple. Locating it in Noida will add to the ecosystem in the region,\u201d sources added. Foxconn started manufacturing iPhone 15 in its Tamil Nadu facility in Sriperumbudur in 2023. Apple ferried 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the US just after announcements of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The company lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at the Chennai airport from 30 hours to six hours.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

US president Donald Trump\u2019s administration this weekend excluded phones and other consumer electronics from steep \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs in what was a significant boost for tech groups whose stocks plunged after the president unleashed a global trade war on \u201cliberation day\u201d. But speaking on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Mr Lutnick said such products would be re-examined as part of a government probe into semiconductors, which face a separate round of tariffs.

Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email He highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers. When Donald Trump launched his tariff war with China, he expressed hopes for major companies like Apple to manufacture their products in the United States. However, industry experts and critics argued that large-scale manufacturing in America isn't practical due to various reasons. Amid this, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has resurfaced on social media, where he explains why Apple continues to manufacture its products in China. In the video, Mr Cook debunked the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour. Instead, he highlighted the importance of China's extensive supply chain, infrastructure, and skilled workforce in supporting Apple's manufacturing needs. Mr Cook said, \"There is confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago.\" He further highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers concentrated in one place. He emphasised that Apple's products require advanced tools and high precision, which China excels in due to its deep tooling expertise. \"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is. It is like the products we do require really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with materials that we do are state-of-the-art,\" he added.

Reacting to the video, one user wrote, \"True, it's about scale, speed, and precision. China has a massive pool of highly skilled tooling and manufacturing engineers. It's not just labor, it's a full ecosystem built over decades, with deep supply chains and rapid turnaround that's hard to replicate elsewhere.\" Another commented, \"Totally agree with Tim. Companies exploited China's cheap labour earlier, but it was China's rapid development of manufacturing tech that took it so ahead of the US and Germany's of the world.\" Notably, Apple relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted its focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base. India's growing electronics manufacturing ecosystem, coupled with government incentives and a large skilled workforce, makes it an attractive location for Apple to set up production facilities.

First, it has been reported that the Vision Pro 2 is on the way from the Cupertino-based tech giant, which is expected to address latency and compatibility issues. In addition, it is also being reported that a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro is currently in the works. Vision Pro 2 and More Are Coming Soon From Apple Analyst Mark Gurman ( via Bloomberg ) revealed Apple's plans for the future of the Vision Pro lineup. The tech company is said to be now all hands-on deck for its next developments. Two headsets are reportedly in the works that seek to address issues that the original Vision Pro has. First, there will reportedly be a Vision Pro 2 from the company, but it is not what people are expecting. Gurman said that Apple will not jump from the M2 to the M5 but will focus more on offering an ultra-low latency experience that plugs into the Mac in order to access more applications for the headset. On the other hand, there will also reportedly be a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro. Tim Cook Wants to Beat Meta in XR Tech Apart from that, Gurman also revealed that Apple wants to beat Meta at its game, with CEO Tim Cook's intending to develop a pair of AR glasses. This information was reportedly shared by an Apple engineer who claimed that Cook does not care about \"anything else\" other than to develop \"true\" AR glasses with cameras and microphones to gp up against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and Project Orion in the future. Apple's Vision Pro The Apple Vision Pro was the talk of the town when Apple first introduced it almost two years ago, centering on a wearable headset packed with significant features. When it was released, the Vision Pro went through the ups and downs as sales faltered after several months, but it still earned accolades along the way, including Popular Science's \" Innovation of the Year .\" Despite its poor performance later on, there is still more to be expected from Apple in their Vision Pro development, with two devices reported to reinforce the lineup . It was previously revealed by Cook that the original Vision Pro was meant for developers, and he defended the original pricing of the headset, saying it was made for those who can afford this early adoption of the device.

This exemption spares U.S. consumers from potential price increases on these widely used products, which are predominantly manufactured in countries like China and India. While this move provides temporary relief for Apple and its customers, it also raises critical questions about the long-term impact of trade policies on global manufacturing strategies and the broader technology sector. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details about the exemption. Watch this video on YouTube . How Tariff Exemptions Affect Apple and Consumers By excluding Apple products from higher tariffs, the U.S. government has effectively shielded consumers from substantial price hikes. Without this exemption, Apple would likely have passed the increased production costs onto buyers, making its devices significantly more expensive. For example, a high-end iPhone manufactured entirely in the U.S. could cost as much as $3,500, a price point that would render it unaffordable for many consumers. This exemption allows Apple to maintain its current pricing structure, making sure that its devices remain accessible to a broad audience. For consumers, this means continued access to Apple\u2019s products at familiar price points, preserving affordability in a market where rising costs are a constant concern. However, this relief is temporary, as future trade policy changes could still disrupt pricing and availability. Apple\u2019s Global Manufacturing Strategy Apple\u2019s reliance on global manufacturing hubs, particularly in China and India, is a cornerstone of its supply chain. These countries offer access to skilled labor, advanced manufacturing infrastructure, and lower production costs, allowing Apple to produce high-quality devices at competitive prices. While Apple has made investments in U.S.-based facilities, such as its Texas plant for server production and chip-related processes, the company has no immediate plans to shift large-scale iPhone production to the U.S. due to the prohibitive costs involved. This global manufacturing strategy highlights the complexities of balancing cost efficiency with geopolitical and economic pressures. The tariff exemption temporarily alleviates some of these pressures, but it does not resolve the underlying challenges of Apple\u2019s production model. As trade policies evolve, Apple will need to continuously adapt its strategy to maintain its competitive edge while addressing the demands of various stakeholders. Trade Policies and Their Influence on Pricing The tariff exemption underscores the intricate relationship between global trade policies and regional pricing strategies. While U.S. consumers benefit from stable iPhone prices, the situation in other regions remains less predictable. In some markets, Apple may absorb additional costs to maintain competitive pricing, while in others, it might adjust prices upward to offset potential losses caused by tariffs or other economic factors. This uncertainty extends beyond Apple. Competitors like Samsung and Google, which also rely on manufacturing in China, face similar challenges. If tariffs are imposed on their products, they may need to reevaluate their pricing strategies, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers worldwide. This dynamic creates a ripple effect across the consumer electronics market, influencing not only pricing but also innovation and product availability. Competitor Responses and Consumer Implications The tariff exemption for Apple products raises important questions about how competitors will respond. Companies like Samsung and Google, which directly compete with Apple in the smartphone and consumer electronics markets, may be forced to adjust their pricing models if tariffs increase their production costs. This could result in higher prices for a wide range of devices, from smartphones to laptops and wearables. For consumers, the affordability of future devices remains a pressing concern. Speculation about the pricing of upcoming iPhone models, such as the iPhone 17, continues to grow. Many wonder how long Apple can sustain its current pricing structure amid global economic pressures and evolving trade policies. The broader industry faces similar challenges as manufacturers grapple with balancing cost efficiency, competitive pricing, and consumer demand. The Bigger Picture The decision to exempt Apple products from higher tariffs highlights the interconnected nature of trade policies, global manufacturing, and the consumer electronics industry. While U.S. consumers currently benefit from stable prices on Apple devices, the long-term implications for the industry remain uncertain. Companies like Apple must navigate an increasingly complex landscape, balancing production costs, pricing strategies, and consumer affordability to maintain their market positions. As trade policies and economic conditions continue to evolve, the ripple effects will likely shape the future of technology pricing and accessibility worldwide. For now, the exemption provides short-term relief, but it also serves as a reminder of the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead for Apple, its competitors, and the global tech industry.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA Pat Leahy Mon Apr 14 2025 - 06:00 The first face-to-face meeting between the EU and the United States since the White House imposed tariffs on imports to the US will take place on Monday when EU trade commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d meets commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and US trade officials in Washington, DC. EU countries including Ireland will be watching anxiously for a sign that substantive negotiations with the US to avoid a damaging trade war can begin soon \u2013 but this weekend senior officials in Dublin and Brussels were hopeful, rather than confident of this. Dublin is especially concerned that pharmaceuticals \u2013 which comprise the great bulk of Irish exports to the US \u2013 should be part of the overall negotiations. The EU and Ireland expect that if pharma exports are part of the broader trade negotiations, they are unlikely to be hit with special tariffs, despite repeated threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on the sector soon.

But Ireland is also wary of an EU response that includes a digital services tax on US tech giants \u2013 a move the Taoiseach told The Irish Times he would oppose and which Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers said on Sunday would signal that \u201cwe\u2019re at a point of enormous damage for the Irish economy\u201d. The unpredictability of the US position was further underlined over the weekend when the Trump administration said that it would exempt smartphones, computers and some other electronic goods from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. The exclusions, published late on Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump\u2019s 125 per cent China tariff and his baseline 10 per cent global tariff on nearly all other countries \u2013 though the White House later indicated that Chinese products would still face an earlier 20 per cent tariff. The announcement came as a relief to Apple , a major Irish taxpayer which manufactures smartphones in China and which saw its share price plummet last week, knocking more than $600 billion (\u20ac528 billion) off the company\u2019s value. However, Mr Lutnick said on Sunday that the exemption was not permanent and such products would be re-examined as part of a government investigation into semiconductors, which face a separate round of tariffs. Senior EU and Irish sources say they hope that Monday\u2019s meeting can lay the groundwork for detailed negotiations between the EU and the US over the coming months. There is hope on the EU side that concessions to the US, such as easing existing tariffs on US cars and undertaking to purchase more American liquefied natural gas, could pave the way for the Trump administration to claim victory and set aside its EU tariffs. But the unpredictability of President Trump makes any expectations about the future unreliable. It is this uncertainty that is spooking global markets, which will be closely watched on Monday morning for signs of a continuing sell-off in US assets, identified by many analysts last week. Some market analysts say the Trump tariffs \u2013 and the increasingly unilateralist position of the US more generally \u2013 is prompting a retreat from US shares and bonds, a trend that could make financing the US government\u2019s huge deficit more difficult. A move away from US assets could also endanger the position of the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency \u2013 a move that would have far-reaching implications for the global financial system. EU foreign affairs ministers, including T\u00e1naiste Simon Harris , are expected to discuss the US tariffs on the margin of a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, though the agenda is dominated by Ukraine and Israel-Palestine.

Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty Images Pilita Clark Mon Apr 14 2025 - 06:00 Bit by bit, one by one, they started to come out. After days of market mayhem, America\u2019s billionaires finally did something this week that few top bosses have done since Donald Trump took office in January: sound off about the US president\u2019s actions. Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs , they said, were a \u201chuge policy mistake\u201d born of \u201cstupidity\u201d that could spark an \u201ceconomic nuclear winter\u201d and in some cases amounted to \u201cbullshit\u201d. Talk about a gear shift. Until this market-melting moment, companies across the US had shown striking levels of deference to Trump\u2019s agenda. READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football Everyone wants a piece of the sport chat action It is hard to say if this will change after his tariff backdown, but what is clear is just how hard it is to deal with an administration bent on upending normal rules of business engagement. To start with, there is simple confusion. Last week I spoke to Nneka Chiazor, head of the Public Affairs Council in Washington, a non-partisan association of public affairs professionals from some of the largest US companies. She had just come back from meeting some of her members in Brussels, who peppered her with questions such as: \u201cCan we still say \u2018green\u2019?\u201d; \u201cIs \u2018clean\u2019 still okay?\u201d; \u201cWould it be okay if we participated in [New York] Climate Week?\u201d \u201cPeople are struggling with how to show respect for the US administration\u201d while honouring their commitments to customers and other stakeholders, she said. That struggle is harder when you see how fraught it can be for companies to do a U-turn on measures they once championed that do not chime with the Trump administration. \u201cEveryone looks completely hypocritical and directionless\u201d, said New York University professor Alison Taylor, author of Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World. \u201cThat has the impact of making anything that they say look completely implausible, which I don\u2019t think is super smart.\u201d Then there is financial risk. The number of shoppers visiting Target stores has fallen for nine weeks in a row since the retailer triggered a customer boycott with a January statement indicating it was pulling back from diversity initiatives it had long promoted, data from the Placer.ai analytics firm shows. In contrast, footfall has kept growing at Costco, which fought a shareholder proposal aimed at undermining its diversity and inclusion initiatives. Correlation is of course not causation. Many other factors could explain the difference. Target\u2019s trust and likeability score \u2013 a chief measure of reputation \u2013 did drop to a four-year low in the first quarter of this year, reckons market intelligence firm Caliber. But the Caliber surveys this is based on show it continues a downward trend that began years before Target\u2019s diversity retreat. Also, Caliber research on 10 big US companies including Target, Walmart and Apple indicates most had little or no change in their trust scores from the last quarter of 2024, regardless of whether they dropped or defended diversity measures. But employee trust is another matter. Consider the hundreds of associates from some of the world\u2019s largest law firms that have signed an open letter condemning the administration\u2019s targeting of firms it opposes. Imagine how they felt when some of their firms then caved in, pledging millions of dollars in pro bono services to administration-approved causes \u2013 a move that seems to have surprised even the president. Firms are saying \u201cWhere do I sign? Where do I sign?\u201d, Trump marvelled at the White House last month. \u201cNobody can believe it.\u201d Perhaps. History suggests companies are rarely at the vanguard of political resistance, no matter how high the stakes get. Dutch journalist David de Jong says that, in the years of research he did for his 2022 book Nazi Billionaires, he came across just two examples of major industrialists or companies defying Nazi Germany. Robert Bosch, founder of the eponymous engineering and technology group, and steel tycoon Fritz Thyssen. Charles Hecker\u2019s 2024 book Zero Sum offers another lesson about the foreign companies that kept doing business in an increasingly authoritarian Russia. In one telling example, a senior European executive reveals these firms\u2019 corporate headquarters were \u201cwagging their fingers\u201d about Moscow\u2019s illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, while urging their Russian offices to boost sales next year. The US of 2025 is no Russia of 2014, let alone 1930s Germany. All the same, any US company that bends to an administration uncommonly determined to bring its adversaries to heel is following a familiar path. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Donald Trump United States US tariffs IN THIS SECTION Q&A: How will the Government\u2019s new plan to support businesses affect workers?

Much attention has focused on the mag seven\u2019s growing influence on index returns, given they account for 30 per cent of the S&P 500\u2032s market capitalisation and 17 per cent of the MSCI All-Cap World Index\u2019s (ACWI).

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft.

This includes a couple of highly anticipated features including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as the ability to switch the \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound when driving at low speeds. Latest Proton e.MAS 7 OTA update schedule As shared by Pro-Net product expert David Tiah, Proton e.MAS 7 has recently received an April OTA (Over-the-air) update which adds the Start/Stop charging button on the main central display, optimised braking experience and the ability to view the EV\u2019s location when the car is asleep. For those who are waiting for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, he revealed that Wireless Apple CarPlay is coming in the Q2 Update that\u2019s expected to be pushed by July 2025, while Wired Apple CarPlay is coming in Q3 Update (By October 2025). For Android users, Wired and Wireless Android Auto is expected to arrive in Q4 (by December 2025). Other known usability complaints and feedback are also being addressed as well via OTA. Pro-Net will be giving users to change the AVAS (Ice Cream Truck) sound and bug fixes for Radio scan in the Q2 Update which is expected to be pushed by July. Meanwhile, the permanent speed warning sound memory switch will be added in the Q3 Update which is expected to be pushed by October 2025. As announced earlier , Wireless Apple CarPlay was supposed to be delivered by June. When we asked them about the delay, Pro-Net said they are taking a little bit more time for certification and testing to ensure that the feature works well for all users when it is rolled out. Proton e.MAS app to integrate Shell Recharge chargers very soon At the moment, Proton e.MAS 7 users can experience seamless EV charger discovery, activation and payment directly from the Proton e.MAS app. Through the Proton e.MAS app, users can get access to almost 90% of public chargers in the country from various Charge Point Operators (CPO). As a result, there\u2019s no longer a need to download multiple charging apps from every single CPO. After integrating Charge+ and RExcharge chargers last month, Pro-Net Deputy Head of Charging Ahmad Munif Halim reveals that Shell Recharge will soon be integrated in the app. Tags: Android Auto Apple CarPlay Charge Plus Electric Vehicle EV EV Charger EV charging Pro-Net Proton Proton e.Mas 7 Shell Recharge Alexander Wong POPULAR Proton e.MAS 7: Wireless Apple CarPlay and \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound switch coming in July via OTA Update April 14, 2025 MGS5 EV confirmed for Malaysia: Should BYD, Proton be worried?

Some early estimates suggested that iPhone prices could have tripled if companies like Apple had passed the extra costs on to consumers. The timing of this exemption feels especially critical. Apple, for one, manufactures about 80% of its iPhones for the US market in China. Without relief, they were looking at an impossible situation: either swallow the cost or jack up prices. It\u2019s the same story for Samsung, which has been trying to diversify its supply chain to avoid over-reliance on China, with India and Vietnam stepping in as alternative hubs. Of course, not every tech product is safe. Game consoles, for example, have already felt the squeeze. Nintendo reportedly delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US because of these tariffs. Trump\u2019s tariff policy has been aggressive across the board. He raised China-specific import taxes to 145%, blaming Beijing\u2019s 84% retaliatory tariffs for the hike. The White House is spinning this as a negotiating tactic. Trump claims the endgame is fairer trade, fewer supply chain dependencies, and more factories returning to American soil. Whether or not that works is still up for debate. But for now, with Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, US tech companies\u2014and anyone eyeing a new iPhone\u2014can breathe a little easier.

The article has been amended to reflect the new details. MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with an estimated price tag that starts at RM115,000 . This was revealed during SAIC Motor Malaysia \u2019s media preview session today, which marked the electric SUV\u2019s first official outing in our market. Expected to be a major rival to current market darlings such as Proton e.MAS 7 and BYD Atto 3 Ultra, the MGS5 EV will be available in Malaysia in two main variants. However, the company did not reveal the specific pricing for each variant, which is something that they are saving for the official launch this May. MGS5 EV Malaysia quick specs Built with a rear-wheel drive setup, the MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with two battery configurations. The base-spec model is powered by a 49kWh LFP battery, which allows the variant to deliver a WLTP-rated range of 340km alongside a DC charging speed of 120kW. On the other hand, the high-spec MGS5 EV for Malaysia is equipped with a 62.2kWh LFP battery. It also has a much higher WLTP-rated range of 430km and supports a DC charging speed of up to 150kW. For the electric motor though, things are slightly unclear. This is because the presentation slide and press release only mentioned the 125kW (168hp) electric motor which also produces 250Nm of torque. However, the presentation slide during the preview event said that the MGS5 EV has a 0-100km/h timing of 6.1 seconds. This figure did not match the century timing for the 125kW motor which is supposed to be around 8 seconds. The 6.1 seconds 0-100km/h timing is supposed to be for the 180kW (242hp) electric motor as per the one that was fitted to the high-spec MGS5 EV in Thailand. We have reached out to SAIC Motor Malaysia\u2019s representative to obtain further clarifications but were told that more details will only be announced during the public launch this May. Meanwhile, both MGS5 EV variants do share a lot of features with each other. They include the 6.6kW AC charging, Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) capability, a 12.8-inch infotainment display, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto, MG Pilot Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), and 7 airbags. The electric SUV also supports the MG iSMART mobile app that allows owners to remotely lock or unlock their car, check its location and charging status, as well as control the climate settings. You can also use the app to transform your phone into a digital key for the EV. At the same time, the high-spec MGS5 EV also has a long list of extra features. Among them include 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a powered tailgate, MG perforated pattern on the seats, a heated leather steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat, 6 premium audio speakers, rear reading lamps, rain-sensing wipers and a 360-degree surround-view camera. In terms of colourways, the MGS5 EV in Malaysia includes Arctic White, Monument Silver, Camden Grey, and Dynamic Red as well as the Elegant Latte which is reserved for the high-spec model. The electric SUV comes standard with a dark interior as well as seats made out of a leather and fabric combination.

Written by Shaurya Tomer , Edited by Siddharth Suvarna | Updated: 14 April 2025 10:06 IST Apple is expected to preview the iPadOS 19 update at WWDC 2025 in June Highlights Apple may bring Mac-like functionality to iPad models with iPadOS 19 It is reported to improve multitasking, productivity and app management iPadOS 19 overhaul is said to be one of the key agendas at WWDC 2025 Advertisement Apple is said to be working on a major overhaul of iPadOS , the operating system (OS) which powers the iPad. According to claims by a seasoned journalist, the Cupertino-based technology giant's next iteration of iPadOS, i PadOS 19 , could make the iPad operating system more like macOS. With several iPad models getting an upgrade to the latest M4 chipset, Apple is reportedly gearing up to focus on delivering more productivity and improving the multitasking capabilities of its tablets. iPadOS 19 Overhaul This information comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In the latest edition of the Power On newsletter , the journalist claims that revamping the iPadOS software will be one of the key agendas during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) 2025, which kicks off on June 9. With recent upgrades to iPad models, hardware capabilities of the tablets have left behind its software. So far, the iPad OS has been an extension of iOS , offering similar features adapted to a larger screen size. However, users have been asking for more \u2014 more features, more multitasking capabilities, and more productivity. And it seems like Apple will finally listen. As per Gurman, the iPhone maker is aiming to make the iPad operate more like a Mac. Moto Book 60 Laptop, Moto Pad 60 Pro Tablet to Debut on This Date With iPadOS 19, it is said to focus on improving productivity, multitasking and app window management. This report contradicts more context to past information by the same journalist who suggested that Apple's next-generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac OS versions would focus more on delivering visual changes than adding new features. Previous claims by Gurman suggest that the company will minimise the visual differences across devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and the Apple Vision Pro and deliver a more cohesive experience. Thus, its operating systems may come with user interface (UI) elements akin to visionOS, the OS powering the spatial headset. While official details remain scarce, one of the rumoured changes is glass effects throughout the UI. Oppo Pad 4 Pro Launched With Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 12,140mAh Battery Apple's iPad Fold and iPhone Fold Could Launch Next Year As per the journalist, Apple aims to eliminate differences in system actions such as hamburger menus and menu buttons, the menu bar, and button for closing applications. Some applications are suggested to get reworked to aid a new generation of users in better understanding their devices.

Upgrade Now Morning Bid: Doing the tariff two-step German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt \u00b7 Reuters Reuters Sun, Apr 13, 2025, 9:33 PM 3 min read (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole So the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are off smartphones and some electronics, but maybe only for a while as they could get their own special tariff once the White House has completed a study of the global supply chain. Or something. Indeed, Trump on Sunday told reporters tariffs on semiconductors would be announced over the next week and a decision on phones made \"soon\". Essentially more of the same chaos. How anyone running a company can decide on long-term investments in such conditions is a mystery, which has limited the boost to Wall Street futures for the moment. The S&P 500 was up around 0.8% and the Nasdaq 1.2%, though you would have to assume Apple shares, at least, will benefit in the near term. European stock futures have actually performed better, perhaps on speculation that President Trump will blink on other levies, too. Or it could be investors are buying Europe now that U.S. exceptionalism and \"exorbitant privilege\" - the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency - are under such threat. The dollar is certainly feeling unloved, falling back under 143.00 yen and extending last week's 5% slide on the Swiss franc. The euro is knocking on $1.1400 again and even the high-beta Aussie and kiwi are up, a sure sign the dollar's safe-haven status is in jeopardy. Apparently, Japanese officials are gearing up for trade negotiations with the United States that will likely touch on currency policy, with some officials privately bracing for Washington to call on Tokyo to prop up the yen. Should the White House actively start talking the dollar down, it will spook those offshore investors with unhedged positions in U.S. assets - which is most of them. At least Treasuries are steadier, though they show little sign of reversing last week's astonishing 50-basis-point jump in longer-term yields. If sustained, that's a material tightening in financial conditions and a deadweight for the housing market, adding another reason for the Fed to ease even if inflation is heading higher. It will be interesting to see if the New York Fed survey of inflation expectations due later on Monday shows the same kind of spike seen in the University of Michigan numbers. Retail sales data for March on Wednesday could be strong as consumers rushed to buy autos and other goods before the tariffs go into effect. Fed Chair Powell also has a chance to provide his outlook on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago, where the Q&A should be lively. Markets imply a 20% chance of a May rate cut, rising to almost 80% for June. Some 80 basis points of easing are priced in for the year, though that was up around 130 basis points this time last week.

The response has been chaotic. Companies like Framework, which specializes in modular laptops, and Nintendo, with its game consoles, were hit especially hard. Framework had to pause sales of some laptop models in the US . Nintendo also delayed pre-orders of the recently announced Switch 2 , in order to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\" As the backlash grew, the Trump administration pulled back slightly by announcing exemptions for key electronics like smartphones, laptops, memory cards, and semiconductors. Now, reports indicate the exemption of smartphones, laptops, and other electronics will be short-lived. CNN highlighted comments made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, where he stated that the exemptions will be short-lived, with new tariffs targeting electronics already in the works. You can read the full transcript here . Hours later, Trump made a post on Truth Social , where he claimed that no such exemptions exist, as products like smartphones and laptops remain subject to existing tariffs, specifically the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs. NOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u201cbucket.\u201d The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Trump administration hopes that the tariffs will make the US less reliant on countries like China in terms of manufacturing . Industry executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook have reiterated that manufacturing in China is not because of cheap labour, but due to a shortage of skilled labour elsewhere, a sentiment that Elon Musk also shares.

SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. Reuters TSMC , the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 54% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though is also likely to flag risk from trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a trend towards implementing AI features in online products. But the firm faces headwind not just from Trump's import tariffs but also his criticism of Taiwan's dominance of the chip industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is set to report net profit of T$347.8 billion ($10.74 billion) for the three months through March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 17 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2024 first-quarter net profit of T$225.5 billion. TSMC has been spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, though it said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. It announced a $100 billion investment with Trump at the White House last month, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona. Live Events Trump has both praised Taiwan's chip industry and threatened it with tariffs. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Last week, he said he had told TSMC it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if it did not build factories in the U.S. On Sunday, he said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from tariffs on China will be short-lived, pledging a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector. \"The company will likely double down on overseas fab investments to mitigate the geopolitical risk, despite two to three percentage points of gross margin dilution for the next five years,\" said SemiAnalysis analyst Sravan Kundojjala. \"This will likely ensure TSMC gets favourable treatment from the U.S. government and minimise the tariff burden.\" Apple's iPhones, given they are mainly made in China, is another risk area for TSMC, said Cathay Futures analyst Venson Tsai. \"If the iPhone can't be sold, then TSMC's chips can't either,\" Tsai said. TSMC last week reported a surge in first-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, slightly ahead of market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. It will also update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure for production increases. On its last earnings call in January, TSMC said it expected capital spending this year to be $38 billion to $42 billion, an increase of as much as 41% from last year.

See full bio Edward Moyer April 12, 2025 12:49 p.m. PT 2 min read James Martin/CNET Another twist in the tariff saga: Smartphones , laptops and other consumer electronics may not see soaring prices due to tariffs after all, at least for the time being. Late Friday, the Trump administration exempted such products from the reciprocal tariffs it had imposed earlier, including the 125% fees levied on imports from China, where many tech and electronics products are manufactured. A notice to shippers posted late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection included a list of tariff codes for product categories that won't be subject to the fees. Code 8471 covers computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing, Reuters reported . Flat panel displays, memory chips and semiconductors will also sidestep the tariff fees, the news outlet said. Industry observers had feared massive price hikes on tech and other gear as a result of tariffs, and concerns had prompted some consumers to rush to buy iPhones and other products. Apple Store employees saw an uptick in foot traffic last weekend, with one worker telling Bloomberg that the surge felt like the holiday shopping season. It's unclear whether the exemption will stay in place, however, with both Bloomberg and The New York Times reporting that different tariff fees may end up affecting electronics equipment down the line. What this means for you If your head's spinning over all the back-and-forth tariff developments, you're definitely not alone. What does it mean for the prices you'll see when crossing things off your shopping list? The short answer is: Don't be surprised if you wind up paying more for at least some goods and services. For details, you can check out our Tariffs Explained piece. And before this latest news, we asked CNET experts to give us their best predictions and advice when it comes to shopping for tech products like laptops, phones, TVs and more. See their responses in our Buy or Wait guide. Although a CNET survey showed that some people are rushing to buy tech gear before anticipated price rises, experts caution against busting out the credit card. If you already had your eye on a particular product and you'd set aside the money for it, buying now, or during an upcoming sale, could help you save money. It could also help you breathe a little easier. But again, be wary of taking on debt. Find out more here .

I've got countless memories of grabbing some Duracell batteries to throw in toys, remotes, and other tools growing up, all the way up to toys for my kids. Duracell is a well-known, highly-reputable company that people recognize and trust. Having reviewed the best portable power stations , I can confidently say this one is meant for everyday use, has excellent ports, and is a simple backup for essentials. However, what sets this power station apart is not the bold design, port offering, power output, or capacity. What sets this apart is that you can recharge it with a standard AC extension cord. There is no fancy proprietary charger or IEC cable that swears on the cable that you can only use for that power station. Any AC extension cable will do.

They offer a smaller variant, but if you're going with this company, I'd choose this larger one for portable power stations. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Unboxing & first impressions When I first found the Duracell G800, I thought it was a gimmick. A power station resembling a famous battery wouldn't work well. But, once I got it, I was proven wrong. The build quality is excellent, the packaging is professional and straightforward, the handle is comfortable to carry, the port offering is fantastic, and then I noticed the way to charge, and I realized this is working hard to compete right out of the gate. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Design & build quality Specs Battery Capacity: 620Wh Output: 800W (shared across 3 AC ports) Ports: \u2022 3x AC Outlets (total 800W shared) \u2022 3x USB-A (7.2A shared) \u2022 2x USB-C (100W per port, 200W total) \u2022 1x Car charger port (120W max) Weight: 19.4 lbs Dimensions: 12.5\u201d x 8.3\u201d x 11.5\u201d The Duracell G800 is a unique look. It's got a bronze top half to resemble the famous battery, but what's great is that Duracell chose to make the line between the black and copper a ring light, helping light whatever you may be trying to plug in, in the dark, without power, thus the need for a power station. Further, the handle is solid and firm, and there is some integrated storage on the backside of the power station to help carry the power cable or any USB-C/USB-A cables. Thankfully, all the main ports are on the front, which I appreciate. It makes for a portable power station that is easy to use, allowing for this to be set down and forgotten about while charging whatever you may be keeping charged. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: In use Admittedly, I've had this G800 for around 160 days. However, in that time, I've had my team put this thing to the test in real-life scenarios. I've had this power station help out when charging cameras on the go out of the back of my Jeep, charging iPads and computers on a long trip, and being a light source and emergency power in a power outage. I've had this power station help out my family in Florida during the crazy hurricanes this last year. In all the scenarios, this power station functioned great. The handle makes it easy to maneuver in all of these environments, and the forward-facing ports mean that all ports are accessible simultaneously. Throughout my time testing, the most standout feature is that this unit recharges with a standard AC extension cord outlet. One thing that makes a power station less usable is when it has a proprietary charger or a unique charger that works only for that unit. It makes recharging more cumbersome, more challenging in many ways, and more expensive if you ever damage or misplace your charger. With Duracell, they chose to go the opposite route of an Apple with the (late) Lightning cable, and they decided to go with a cable option that is nearly everywhere (in the US). This may be an intentional move, or it's beginner's luck; regardless, I am a fan. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) While testing, I got this power station recharged to an impressive 80 percent in about an hour, just as Duracell suggests. I got my 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro fully recharged about 8.5 times, depending on just how heavily I ran it when plugged in (I run my computers hard with all that I do in a day). Duracell promotes being able to run a Wi-Fi router for around 26 hours, a TV (very generic) for 5 hours, a mini cooler for 22 hours, a drone for 26 charges, and lights for 6.7 hours. If you want to extend your off-grid power, plug in a G-Solar Panel to recharge the power station directly from the sun.

Marathon Closed Alpha Begins In April, Here's How To Sign Up Want to try the next game from Halo and Destiny developer Bungie? Now's your chance. By Eddie Makuch on April 12, 2025 at 11:00AM PDT 2 Comments Where to buy Marathon There are currently no available deals GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers. As part of the Bungie's reveal showcase for its next game, Marathon, the studio announced a closed alpha test and confirmed how players can sign up for access. The Marathon closed alpha starts later this month, and players can join the Marathon Discord channel for a chance to get in. Bungie said its teams will be \"actively engaging\" with the Discord channel, including conducting live Q&As and generally discussing the project directly with fans. Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter. It's a successor of sorts to Bungie's 1994 game of the same name. Whereas Bungie today is better known for its work on the Destiny and Halo franchises, the original Marathon was one of Bungie's first big successes when it was released for Mac and Apple Pippin. Marathon 2: Durandal followed in 1995, with Marathon Infinity coming in 1996. It wasn't until 2001 that Bungie truly broke out in a major way with the debut of Halo: Combat Evolved. Sony now owns Bungie, but the new Marathon is in the works for platforms beyond the PS5 alone, including Xbox Series X|S and PC--cross-play is supported across all platforms. Marathon will mark Bungie's first big new release since Sony acquired the company in 2022. Marathon launches on September 23 , the same day as Borderlands 4.

The former TV presenter has shared her life story in her memoir, No Words for This , published last month. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In it, she details publicly for the first time the sexual assault she experienced from her father, who also abused her sister and nephew. Speaking to Paula Bennett on her NZ Herald podcast Ask Me Anything , Mau said a lot of people have told her they are surprised by her story, but she doesn\u2019t think they should feel that way as it is \u201cso common\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll have heard that statistic, one in three women, one in seven men experience sexual harm in their lifetime \u2013 and these are official police figures. \u201c[That\u2019s] 930,000 New Zealanders have experienced, not necessarily exactly what I experienced, but some kind of sexual harm in their lifetime. It\u2019s almost a million people. \u201cSo the surprising thing is not that it happened at all. The surprise comes from the fact that we don\u2019t talk about it enough. It is, I believe, the last big taboo subject in our society. And it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Advertisement Advertise with NZME. She said that is why she wrote the book, because these conversations need to be had and should be had. \u201cIf you think 10 or 15 years ago, we were, as a society, not able to talk about domestic violence. And then a bunch of incredibly committed women have worked over that time to change that around completely and make it a national conversation that we can have to the point where one of the biggest retailers in the country sponsors women\u2019s refuge. \u201cI believe we can do that with sexual harm as well.\u201d Mau has spoken to hundreds of sexual harm survivors, men and women, and said they often speak of a level of shame or self-blame. She said she was able to apply that to herself when telling her story. Mau is now working on a charity, Tika, to help victims get legal support. She is launching it with barrister Zoe Lorton and it is a concept they have been working on since 2018. When they started exploring the issue, they found that only 7% of sexual harm victims report their case, and the figure had not changed in a decade. \" I naively had assumed that all the awareness-raising would move the needle on that, and it hadn\u2019t.\" Tika, when it launches later this year, is an online platform that will allow victims to input details about their perpetrator and get connected with a lawyer to find out what their legal route forwards is. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. \" It\u2019s a game changer. Do you know that you cannot, even at this point, report sexual harm online? You have to walk into a police station or phone and speak to a uniformed officer at the front desk. \u201cWhen you think about the generations of my children\u2019s age and younger, they do everything on their phone. \u201cSo being able to offer a secure platform that they can trust, that will tell them whether anybody else has been harmed by the same person, even just that step is incredibly powerful for somebody who\u2019s been unsure about what to do, but in the back of their mind, they know they\u2019re looking for some kind of accountability and justice.\u201d Listen to the full episode for more from Ali Mau about sharing her story and how she wants to help victims, as well as reflections on her broadcasting career, her public relationship and subsequent divorce from Simon Dallow, and how it felt to be outed.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 President Donald Trump 's decision to exempt many electronics from newly implemented tariffs has sparked surprise from critics, with some citing recent remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to quip about the latest scaling back of the controversial economic policy. Newsweek reached out to the White House and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for comment on Saturday. Why It Matters Earlier this week, Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect for several hours before he paused most of them for 90 days\u2014with the notable exception of China. The United States and China remain in a tit-for-tat trade war, with Trump hiking the 104 percent tariffs on China to 125 percent on Wednesday after Beijing hit back at the U.S. with an 84 percent additional levy earlier in the day. Trump's total tariffs now stand at 145 percent on Chinese goods, while China has imposed a 125 percent tariff, dismissing Trump's strategy as \"a joke.\" As recently as last Sunday, Lutnick said that tariffs would allow smartphone manufacturing to happen in the U.S., instead of abroad. But the Friday announcement of the electronics exemption suggests manufactures will no longer have the immediate incentive to consider producing smartphones and other electronics in the U.S. What to Know A Friday evening update from CBP exempted smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts from the tariffs. The decision was retroactive to as early as April 5. The exemption list includes products the U.S. heavily relies on for overseas production, with limited domestic manufacturing capacity and high consumer demand. Companies such as Apple , which carries out 90 percent of its iPhone manufacturing in China, are set to benefit from the exemptions. \"Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a statement, CNN reported. \"A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend.\" While tech companies may be breathing a sigh of relief, some critics of Trump's tariffs took to X, formerly Twitter , on Saturday to joke about the decision and remind their followers of the administration's own words regarding the tariffs.

Trump literally said there would be 'no exemptions' to his reciprocal tariffs (see video) and MAGA cheered. 'No, with reciprocal [tariffs] you don't need to,' he said. Now, suddenly he's backtracking again and adding a bunch of exemptions to his reciprocal tariffs. And MAGA is cheering yet again. It's almost as if he has no idea what he's doing and MAGA doesn't stand for anything except whatever Trump says and does.\" Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and prominent Trump critic, wrote on X: \"More exemptions, so the question remains: If tariffs are so great, why so many exemptions?\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on X: \"So these exemptions on electronics from China... Is this how we should see it? 'We are imposing a 145% tariff on all Chinese goods -except what we buy.'\" Keith Olbermann, a political commentator, on X: \"Trump: Tariffs are perfect and beautiful and mandatory and I won't back down. Also Trump: here are 37,498 tariff exemptions for companies who've greased me.\" Tahra Jirari, director of economic analyst at Progress Chamber, on X: \"Incredible. Someone check on Lutnick, I know he wanted us screwing millions of smartphones.\" Sar Haribhakti, who leads global product communications at Stripe, on X: \"Five days ago: Lutnick: 'The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u2014that kind of thing is going to come to America.' Last night:\" Haribhakti reposted the news about the tariff exemptions on electronics. Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, on X : \"More caving (thank goodness). What is the strategy here? President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock.\" President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10 in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10 in Washington, D.C. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images What Officials Are Saying Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to CBS News' Face the Nation last Sunday: \"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u2014that kind of thing is going to come to America.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a Saturday statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" President Donald Trump, in a Wednesday post on Truth Social: \"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\" China's Finance Ministry, in a statement: \"The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.\" What Happens Next? The exemptions are already in effect. Tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, with no sign that other tariffs will be reduced anytime soon. Many other nations are reportedly in the process of negotiating with the Trump administration during the ongoing 90-day pause announced this week. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

Todd is the guest on this week\u2019s edition of Mediaite\u2019s new Press Club podcast , hosted by Aidan McLaughlin , to discuss the media, the news of the day, and life after NBC News, which he left in January after nearly two decades. In the episode, now out on YouTube and podcast platforms, McLaughlin asked Todd about Trump\u2019s tariffs and the resulting stock market roller coaster this week: AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: Trump finally consummated his decades-long flirtation with tariffs. Have you looked at your portfolio this week? CHUCK TODD: I\u2019m over 50, I\u2019m having to look at it every hour. No, I mean, and that\u2019s this, that\u2019s the dirty little, you know what I took his biggest political problem, is that when you\u2019re of a certain age, you start looking at this every day. You know, this whole, \u201cwell people don\u2019t look at the stock market every day.\u201d. Yeah, but the people who are most likely to vote in midterms, they do. They pay attention to if the Social Security office is taking their phone calls. Like, he is rattling constituencies that are the ones that are most likely to show up to vote. Right? So it\u2019s just one of those, you\u2019re like, this is why this could be politically catastrophic. AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: So yeah, so we\u2019re in very much uncharted territory right now. CHUCK TODD: And then some. Todd went on to explain why the chaotic tariff roll-out could be Trump\u2019s \u201cAfghanistan moment\u201d \u2014 a reference to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to a collapse of former President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings, a collapse he never recovered from. He explained: Afghanistan became a competency question. And I think this tariff business for Trump becomes a competency question. \u2018Wait a minute, you went about this all wrong and you caused an economic tsunami. We agree we needed to do it, but you don\u2019t know how to do.\u2019 And in some ways, competency is actually more lethal here than the ideological distinction between the two. And this is why I think he\u2019s probably never going to be over \u2014 barring some we don\u2019t know, rallying around the president because we\u2019re in war or something like this \u2014 I don\u2019t if he ever gets over 45 [percent approval rating] again.

It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145 per cent tariffs levied on China or the 10 per cent baseline tariffs elsewhere. It\u2019s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The goal is to encourage more domestic manufacturing. But the exemptions seem to acknowledge that the current electronics supply chain is virtually all in Asia and it will be challenging to shift that to the US. For example, about 90 per cent of iPhones are produced and assembled in China, according to Wedbush Securities. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing US Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Trump previously said he would consider exempting some companies from tariffs. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment early Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would delay many of the market-shaking tariffs that he\u2019d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he\u2019d already imposed on goods from China). There\u2019s been plenty of speculation about what the tariffs will mean for the tech industry , which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump\u2019s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy . Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are \u201cexcluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,\u201d with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit \u2014 until last night\u2019s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as \u201ca dream scenario for tech investors.\u201d Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigation into semiconductors. And indeed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these products would be included in \u201cthe semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.\u201d This post has been updated with Howard Lutnick\u2019s comments about the tariffs.

Mythic Quest, the Apple TV Plus comedy about a game studio, isn\u2019t getting a fifth season, reports Variety . And, like a developer issuing a farewell patch, Apple is updating the final episode of season four with a new \u201cgoodbye\u201d ending next week. Variety published a statement from Mythic Quest \u2019s executive producers: \u201cEndings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close,\u201d said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\u201d The news comes just weeks after a report that Apple has been losing $1 billion a year on TV Plus. The show just wrapped up its fourth season and released a f our-episode spinoff called Side Quest on March 26th. One of the early Apple TV Plus shows, Mythic Quest tells the story of Mythic Quest Studios, a fictional games studio led by Ian Grimm, Rob McElhenney\u2019s parody of a visionary tech founder bro, and Charlotte Nicdao\u2019s Poppy Li, an awkward but brilliant engineer who serves as his co-creative director. Throughout the series, Mythic Quest sent up the tech industry, from lampooning startup culture to raising some of the gaming world\u2019s darker ethical questions . But to echo an early Verge write-up of Mythic Quest , you don\u2019t need to understand any of that to enjoy the show. Mythic Quest also stars David Hornsby, Ashly Burch, Imani Hakim, Danny Pudi, Jessie Ennis, Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton.

See Full Bio MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle (MSNBC screenshot) MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle appeared with her old hosting partner Ali Velshi on Saturday morning to weigh in on a major announcement from Donald Trump's administration on Chinese imports. In a bulletin posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday, the administration announced smartphones, computers, and assorted electronics would be exempt from the ruinous 145% percent tariffs imposed on other Chinese products. As Ruhle, a former hedge fund trader put it, \"This is huge.\" Speaking with Velshi, she elaborated, \"So just imagine all the big electronics that we get that's manufactured in China , right? Chips, semiconductors, TVs, cell phones \u2013\u2013 all the big electronics out there are now going to be tariff-free. I mean, Ali, this is extraordinary.\" \"It's kind of like saying we're going to impose 100 plus percent tariffs on everything we buy from China, except for what we actually buy from them,\" she dryly quipped. \"It's sort of crazy because we haven't even started negotiating, you know, this trade war and already we're making this announcement.\" \"It's mind-blowing i n that in the last week what have we done,\" she added. \"The president announced the moves on tariff, we saw the stock market crater, we saw the bond market get whacked, which is the most concerning because it means people don't have faith in the U.S.\". \"We saw consumer confidence absolutely crater and businesses big and small fall into an absolute panic, given what an enormous trading partner China is, but also countries around the world, but focusing just on china, man, if you are [ Apple head] Tim Cook or the other big tech CEO's who gave big and went to Trump's inauguration, you are glad you did that,\" she observed.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2. A pack of 120 retainer cleaner tablets because it turns out your Invisalign is supposed to be ~clear~ (it also works on mouthguards and dentures!). All you do is drop a tablet into warm tap water, let your dental device soak for a few minutes, and voila! \u2014 it'll kill bacteria and remove the buildup that's causing discoloration and unpleasant odors. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really loved this product. I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3. A new pair of workout leggings to replace the super pilled ones you wear three times a week. They're made with a thick, buttery soft fabric (no one is seeing those hot pink undies) and have ~pockets~ so you don't have to carry your phone around the gym. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"THESE...are the best leggings I have ever worn in my entire life! They are so smooth and comfortable. Soft as butter. They fit perfectly. It almost feels like you're naked but they feel somehow insulated and cozy. Stretchy and made of amazingly durable quality. I need to get more colors!\" \u2014 Alexandra Shick Get them from Amazon for $24.98 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL, in three inseam lengths, and 45 colors). 4. A pack of AirPods cleaning putty because it's so embarrassing when you want to share earbuds with someone, but yours are coated in wax and dust. Plus, it's soooo satisfying to squish the lil' square into your speaker and see all the gunk it pulls out \u2014 and then you get to enjoy clearer, louder-sounding music! www.amazon.com Before you toss your tech in the trash, at least give this a try. Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used! SO happy I found a solution!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get 24 squares from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two pack sizes). 5. A veggie chopper for keeping your counter tidy while speeding up your prep time. If you love to cook but hate chopping (who doesn\u2019t, right?), this thing is a lifesaver. It chops just about everything \u2014 onions, peppers, zucchinis, potatoes, you name it! Plus, it comes with different blades for slicing, dicing, and even spiraling your favorite veggies. www.amazon.com , Amazon Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: \"If you cook, you need this product! I have had this chopper since 2018 and it is by far my favorite kitchen purchase. I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it has held up great. I just bought my MIL one for Christmas and she already loves how much easier it has made meal prep . It is well made and I like that there are different attachments and sizes. I would recommend this chopper!\" \u2014 Steph Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in five colors and five sets). 6. A pack of two antimicrobial \"flossing toothbrushes\" because your current one looks like it was used to scrub the bathroom floor (no offense). This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7. A WD-40 pen if your squeaky cabinets are driving you up the wall. It's way less messy than traditional spray methods, and reviewers love the precision this pen offers \u2014 perfect for getting into tight spaces and silencing those squeaks once and for all. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" \u2014 BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.99 . 8. A wall-mounted organizer to handle those annoying brooms, mops, rakes, and shovels that are always falling over.

Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks. Spray bottles and cleaning product bottles hang perfectly on there too.\" \u2014 Kavita Chandanie Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two sizes and two colors). 9. A set of double-sided shower rings that make changing your shower curtain or liner easier than it's ever been. Since you hang the curtain on one side and the liner on the other, you'll avoid the hassle of taking the whole thing down every time you switch the curtain/liner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is one of those items you didn\u2019t know you needed, and once you get it, you can\u2019t help but wonder how you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

Promising review: \"I have had chronic issues with pain caused by severely knotted muscles. This massager changed my life! I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier! The only downside is that public restrooms don't have these and I kind of can't go without it lol.

And if you want more Squatty Potty content before making this life-changing purchase, check out our Squatty Potty review ! Promising review: \"I'll do you all the courtesy of NOT adding a photo or video (You're welcome). This works. Whoever invented the toilet had their heart in the right place, but not their knees.

Promising review: \"I love these knives! I\u2019ve had them for a year now and I haven\u2019t had to sharpen them. Good grip, durable, and easy to handle. I hand wash them because we don\u2019t have a dishwasher but they\u2019re very easy to clean. I love the blade covers. It makes them safe for putting them in a drawer. I love not having a big knife block on my counter. Lightweight. They have not rusted.\" \u2014 Nvs Get the 12-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available in a 10-piece set). 15. A spice drawer organizer so you can finally have the neatly arranged, easy-to-find collection of spices you've always wanted.

It's basically like skincare for your driveway! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"The scene: me with a hot glove carrying a drip pan full of au jus. Thumb goes into hot liquid. Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17. A set of gold cable organizers you can stick to your desk or nightstand to hold those cords that are always falling to the ground or getting tangled.

Brighttia / Etsy Brighttia is a New York-based Etsy shop established in 2018 that specializes in industrial and modern interior lighting and decor. Promising review: \"These brass cable organizers are beautiful and high quality. I\u2019m using two of them to keep a plug-in sconce cord attached to the wall and to direct the cord to the electrical outlet. These little gold pieces add a touch of functionality and glamour to the sconces. Exactly what I was looking for.\" \u2014 Amy Margolis Get a set of four from Brighttia on Etsy for $22.98 (available in 12 colors). 18. A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur. It's reusable and works its magic without using anything sticky (so no residue)! This gadget went super viral based on its results \u2014 and that's when you know a product is good. Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine. This breaks down stains and odors at their source, leaving your home smelling fresh and citrusy without using harsh ingredients. That one spot behind the couch that your cat won't stop peeing on doesn't stand a chance. \ud83d\udcaa www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product is amazing!!!! We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22. Some foaming garbage disposal cleaning packets to clean out all the gunk from your roommates who just don't understand the concept of throwing food in the garbage instead of down the sink. Just insert a packet into the disposal with hot water trickling to the side, then turn on the disposal and watch it fizz up \u2014 soon, those gag-worthy smells will be a thing of the past. Amazon Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you\u2019re left with a clean sink! I use with other drain cleaning products, but would 100% recommend for weekly maintenance.\" \u2014 Jessica Hamilton Get a four-pack from Amazon for $7.90 (available in a pack of two). 23. And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Reviewers love how comfortable they are to hold and how they *stay* sharp. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Aside from these being a very inexpensive and aesthetic-looking set, they have an excellent, smooth, molded grip that feels good in the hand. The blades are thick, tight, and strong. They are built to last decades. I absolutely love them! Being a teacher, I use them several times daily, all throughout the year. You will NOT be disappointed, (unless for some odd reason you get a defective pair) I promise! \ud83d\ude03\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\" \u2014 gr8female Get a three-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (available in eight color sets and packs of 24 or 36). 25. Bior\u00e9 blackhead removers to help remove all the gunk and buildup that's clogging up your pores.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

You want to squeeze as much life from a laptop or desktop computer as possible. Doing so can save a substantial amount of money over time, and stops you from contributing to mountains of e-waste . At the same time, dealing with an old, sluggish computer is a frustrating experience. If apps and websites are taking ages to load, it can seriously impact your productivity. At a certain point, the temptation to upgrade to a shiny, speedy new computer proves irresistible. A middle ground exists, which is to make sure your laptop or desktop lasts as long as possible. There are multiple tricks you can try when it starts to show its age\u2014tricks that could mean it stays usable for much longer than you expected. Cut down on the clutter You\u2019ll find several programs starting up with Windows or macOS. Screenshot: Apple One way to stretch the life of your computer is to reduce its load. Uninstall any apps you\u2019re not actively using, and keep your apps trim in terms of extensions and add-ons. We\u2019ve covered how to uninstall programs on Windows and macOS , and it\u2019s not difficult to do. Limiting the number of programs starting up with your computer can help too: It means fewer apps running in the background, freeing up more memory and other system resources. You can take care of this with a few clicks on both Windows and macOS . The more storage space you have the better. It gives your computer and its operating system room to breathe and get organized, and can improve performance. Uninstalling apps should help with this, but also be on the lookout for files that you no longer need or can move somewhere else. Choose some upgrades Some well-chosen upgrades can breathe new life into an old computer. While this is going to cost you money, it won\u2019t cost as much as a full upgrade would\u2014and it could mean you get several years of extra use out of your device. The right upgrade will depend on your system\u2019s specs, how much you have to spend, how easy the system is to upgrade, and how comfortable you are with opening up your computer. This is mostly for Windows PCs and for desktops, though a few limited laptop upgrades are sometimes possible. Upgrading the RAM or the storage on your computer are usually the best upgrades for getting the most bang from your bucks. It could be something as straightforward as buying an external hard drive to move files over to, for example. Install another operating system There are plenty of lightweight Linux distros to choose from. Screenshot: Lubuntu In the interests of doing more with older components, you can install a fresh operating system to replace Windows or macOS, one that\u2019s less demanding on your aging computer. This will wipe everything on your system though, so be sure to back up all of your important files and folders first. Linux is always a popular and completely free option, and it comes in many different flavors (known as distros). Some of them, such as Lubuntu , are designed to be as lightweight as possible. Have a browse around the web and you\u2019ll find many options to pick from, as well as detailed guides to how to make the switch. Then there\u2019s ChromeOS Flex , which essentially turns your Windows or Mac computer into a Chromebook. You\u2019re just running a web browser with a few extras, so older computers should be up to the challenge. As with Linux, this is free to do, and it\u2019s perfect if you spend most of your computing time in a web browser anyway. Use your computer for something else Then there\u2019s the option of using your computer for something else , rather than an all-purpose machine. One option is using your aging laptop or desktop as a media server: It doesn\u2019t have to do anything except stream audio and video to other devices on your network. Plex and Emby are two programs that can help. Or how about turning your ancient computer into a dedicated writing machine? This could work if your machine is so old that it\u2019s no longer getting security updates, so shouldn\u2019t really be connected to the web. Set up a word processor and you\u2019re good to go (you will need a USB drive to get your writing shared elsewhere, however). Repurposing your laptop or desktop doesn\u2019t save you from the cost of an upgrade, because you\u2019ll still need to buy another computer, but it does cut down on e-waste and does mean your hardware stays useful for longer. And when you do finally need to get rid of a computer, make sure you do it responsibly .

While the initial reciprocal tariffs will remain for imports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection shared some new exemptions on tech-related goods. The update was announced yesterday evening and follows various tariff increases, particularly on Chinese imports. The exemptions include many products we're excited to see get some relief. The complete list is available in the official bulletin, but it includes computers, smartphones, semiconductor chips, and other tech goods like flat panel TVs, solar cells, and flash drives. The most recent tariff increase from Trump was 145% on Chinese goods. This sent waves across the tech industry, as many realized the significant impact it would have on many tech products that we rely on, including laptops, desktops, CPUs, semiconductor chips, and any PC component. Large companies like Apple, HP, Dell , and more preemptively imported extra stock before the tariff announcement to skirt some of the impact. You may like Tech enthusiasts brace for Trump tariff price hikes on new components Nvidia may avoid recent tariffs on its AI servers \u2014 60% of Nvidia servers pass through Mexico, may be exempt from Trump tariff flurry These exemptions should benefit industry leaders and consumers alike, who have been anticipating serious price hikes on imported products. This should offset the price increases for customers and manufacturers who rely on imports for construction materials. The United States imports around 66% of its tech goods from China, which caused significant concern when tariffs were first announced and subsequently raised on Chinese imports. We recently reported expectations that consoles, monitors, and laptops would be among the most impacted. Many tariffs initially imposed on April 5th will be reduced for 90 days, but tariffs on China have continued to increase . This exemption list is the first we've seen concerning the tariff situation with China. That said, tariffs will remain in place for all other imports not included in the exemption list. The situation is subject to change, but we'll report any significant updates on the tariff situation as things progress, so be sure to check back regularly for more information.

Reply Are you sure that it includes PC components , not just fully-assembled PCs? Also, I expect cases, heatsinks, and radiators are still be affected by the 25% steel & aluminum tariffs, which did not get suspended. Lastly, the \"de minimis\" exemption on small (sub-$800) packages ends May 2nd. That will hit anything shipped directly from abroad (AliExpress, Temu, some sellers on Amazon & ebay, etc.). I'm not sure exactly how that's going to work, but I think you'll be assessed a customs fee that you pay in order to pick up or receive your package. But, it's the recipient who pays. So, don't expect it to be incorporated into sellers' prices. Reply \"The complete list is available in the official bulletin\" No it's not.

Sure it is, but you have to look up what all those headings/sub correspond to here: https://hts.usitc.gov/ Reply sadly, the only groups that will benefit from these exemptions will be the big businesses. they wont reduce their prices, theyll simply pocket the price difference, while consumers continue to pay inflated prices Reply This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Reply thestryker said: https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8542 So, what's that column labelled \"2\", which says 35% ? Reply bigdragon said: This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . Yeah, I can imagine more and more exemptions getting created, as that 145% rate on Chinese imports begins to bite and retailers & consumers start to recoil at the prices of things. As for tech products, recall that the same thing happened last time around. There was initial panic about motherboards & graphics cards getting hit, but then they were exempted for a time period that kept getting extended. bigdragon said: I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I think the objective hasn't really changed. The strategy is what's now in doubt. bigdragon said: I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Well, yes but I'm sure their case played well, with AI being seen as a strategic priority. Also, it's not just tech executives...

Business Smartphones and computers are now spared from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Updated April 12, 2025 2:02 PM ET Originally published April 12, 2025 12:58 PM ET Juliana Kim Versions of the new Apple iPhone 16 are displayed at an Apple store in in Manhattan Beach, Calif., on April 8. Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images The Trump administration has amended its list of imports that will be affected by sweeping global tariffs in order to exempt certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Politics China put steep tariffs on U.S. exports. Farmers are worried The updated guidance was published Friday night by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The exemption will apply to President Trump's steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed across dozens of countries, which have since been paused until early July as well as the 145% levies currently in place on China. That was the only country excluded from the reciprocal tariff pause. The exemption is effective for products that entered the U.S. or left warehouses starting on April 5. The White House issued a presidential memo about the exemption on Saturday. Sponsor Message When asked about the reasoning behind the exemption, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" Leavitt added, \"At the direction of the President,\" companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" The electronics exemption is a major development in the tariff war with China, which has imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. goods . Prices for electronics from China, a key sector, had been expected to spike . Politics Where do tariffs stand? A look at what's in place and what's on pause Among the items that will now be spared from Trump's steep tariffs include smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and flat panel display modules. But the updated guidance did not address any changes to the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's involvement in the fentanyl trade. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission , China has long been America's chief source for electronic products, with Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia rounding out the top five. There was also concern for American tech giants that rely on supply chains in China, like Apple. Before the updated guidance, Apple was expected to experience major setbacks as a result of the tariffs, Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC earlier this week.
