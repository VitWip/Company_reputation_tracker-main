Federal agencies manage around 640 million acres , or about 28 percent of the nation\u2019s land, an invaluable resource Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has called \u201c America\u2019s balance sheet .\u201d His membership in a luxury real estate club in Montana provides an apt example of how private interests stand to profit from federal lands. Last month, the Interior Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a plan to make large tracts of government land available to developers. \u201cAs we enter the Golden Age promised by President Trump,\u201d Burgum wrote on March 17, \u201cthis partnership will change how we use public resources.\u201d Little has been shared so far about the process for identifying parcels or how they might be sold or transferred. Burgum told CNBC the Interior Department would consider selling hundreds of thousands of federally managed acres within 3 miles of urban areas. Jon Raby, the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, told Bloomberg News the initiative would consider land within 10 miles of towns of 5,000 people. \u201cEither they are making this up as they go along, or the right hand doesn\u2019t know what the left hand is doing,\u201d said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation group. The task force said it will deliver a report to the National Economic Council by today, identifying parcels and outlining how much housing would be built. It also will offer recommendations to \u201creduce the red tape behind land transfers or leases\u201d by \u201c[s]treamlining the regulatory process.\u201d The Interior Department declined an interview but said in a statement to Grist that \u201call options are being explored.\u201d Grist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How Burgum\u2019s connection to the Yellowstone Club demonstrates the potential conflicts of interest that can arise with federal land transfers . According to documents filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which declined to comment, Burgum has not divested his financial interest in the Yellowstone Club. The luxury real estate investment firm owns an exclusive community that covers about 14,000 acres and includes a members-only ski resort. Burgum owns two homes and additional financial interests in the development, which is about an hour south of Bozeman, Montana. Over the last 30 years, the Yellowstone Club has used public land transfers and sales to amass holdings that include a private mountain, trophy trout waters, and an exclusive resort that caters to the wealthy and powerful. Its most recent deal saw the company, which declared bankruptcy in 2009 and was acquired by private equity firm CrossHarbor Capital for a fraction of its value , embark on a controversial land swap in southwestern Montana. That deal was finalized January 17, during the last days of the Biden administration and two months after President Trump nominated Burgum to lead the Interior Department. The Yellowstone Club received 3,855 acres from the U.S. Forest Service in the readily accessible foothills of the Crazy Mountains. In exchange, it gave the Forest Service, which is part of the Department of Agriculture, 6,110 acres of land with fewer recreational opportunities and less valuable wildlife habitat high in the Crazies and the Madison Range. The value of the exchange, which critics argued dramatically reduced access to the mountains by eliminating access to established trails, was never disclosed. \u201cThe version they approved was purposely meant to make it harder for the public to access what remains,\u201d said Nick Gevock, a campaign organizer for the Sierra Club. \u201cBy strategically trading lands you can restrict access to thousands of acres of public land, and effectively make them private.\u201d Grist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How The Yellowstone River runs through Sweet Grass County, Montana, with the Crazy Mountains in the background. William Campbell / Corbis via Getty Images A representative of the Yellowstone Club said in a statement that Burgum \u201chas nothing to do with Yellowstone Club development nor does he have anything to do with the land exchange.\u201d The statement also said that \u201cthe Yellowstone Club is one of numerous private landowners involved in the exchange in two mountain ranges,\u201d and noted the Club saw a net reduction in its land holdings with the deal. It also said the swap included conservation easements to protect land on Crazy Peak and in the Madison Range, and that the Forest Service received several tracts it had long sought. The Forest Service declined to comment. Opponents, including conservative hunting and angling groups , claimed the process violated environmental regulations and misled the public about the Yellowstone Club\u2019s involvement as a neutral party when it paid the bulk of the transaction costs. Gevock, who started following the Club\u2019s business dealings 24 years ago as a reporter for the Bozeman Chronicle, said more than 80 percent of public comments submitted to the Forest Service opposed the deal. That land, which was popular with skiers, hunters, anglers, and hikers, is now beyond the public\u2019s grasp. \u201cOnce the title is transferred, you never get it back,\u201d he said. The Yellowstone Club \u2014 which, through its subsidiary development manager Lone Mountain Land Company , is the de-facto governing structure for the town of Big Sky, Montana \u2014 sits close to a great deal of prime federal real estate, including parcels managed by the National Park Service , the Bureau of Land Management, and the Forest Service . Critics fear that land may now become available to industry and developers. Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, told Grist there are several ways that any acquisition of federal land by the Yellowstone Club could affect Burgum\u2019s financial interests, including changing the value of his properties or potentially lowering fees that the club\u2019s homeowners pay. If the joint task force sets legal precedent to streamline or reduce regulations around federal land swaps, that could impact the Yellowstone Club\u2019s future dealings. If Burgum helps facilitate or speed up future land swaps between the Department of Interior and the club, it would be a direct ethics violation. As a result, \u201cI would strongly urge that he recuse himself from any land swap regulations,\u201d Painter said. Painter told Grist the Interior Department has been a \u201cproblem child in ethics\u201d for years, and he testified to Congress about it last April. He warned about the longstanding close ties between senior Interior Department officials and private industry, and the growing influence of corporations. Congress and the Interior, he said, have a \u201cfiduciary obligation to oversee the administration of federal land for the American people, not just for whoever wants to go and get preferential access to land.\u201d Burgum has used the Yellowstone Club in his political role, hosting a fundraiser with Trump last August there that donors paid $100,000 to attend. He also is not the only politician with ties to the club. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is a member, as are Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, U.S. Representative Troy Downing, and U.S. Senator Tim Sheehy. \u201cThis is the billionaire class wanting to run the country,\u201d Gevock said, \u201cand their vision for the Rocky Mountain West is privatization.\u201d In its March announcement, the Interior Department positioned its joint task force on selling public land as a chance \u201cto build affordable housing stock.\u201d But experts question whether anything that comes of this plan would be accessible to low-income families or actually lower housing prices . Supply constraints are not the primary factor for the country\u2019s housing crisis. Housing stock has risen steadily since 1980, according to a 2023 Congressional Research Service report, although not always where it\u2019s most needed or at the right prices. \u201cOn a national level, it is not necessarily obvious that there is a shortage of housing units,\u201d the report found. \u201cWe actually have more of a supply mismatch than a supply problem,\u201d said Karen Chapple, director of the School of Cities at the University of Toronto. A generation of empty nesters is deciding to stay put rather than move into smaller homes, reducing the national supply of single-family homes in urban areas, she said, even as rural communities see vacancies created by people moving in search of opportunities . And high mortgage rates have recently led people to stay put, reducing the overall supply of homes for sale. Much of the acreage the government manages is in the West and Alaska, often far from jobs and essential infrastructure like roads, water, sewer, and schools. \u201cEveryone who can\u2019t afford housing in Massachusetts is not just going to move to the middle of nowhere in Idaho,\u201d said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity. Instead, the proposal reflects a history of Republican attempts to dismantle public lands that dates to the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s, when conservatives opposed to federal regulations argued states could better manage Western land. (President Ronald Reagan named one of the movement\u2019s allies, James Watt, as Secretary of the Interior in 1981.) The idea still enjoys support among developers, ranchers, and others interested in profiting from the land. The general public largely opposes the idea. A recent Colorado College poll of Western voters found 82 percent disapproved of selling federal land to address the region\u2019s housing problems. \u201cThe land seizure movement is wildly unpopular across party lines,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting to the point where the polling is as obvious as asking if people like apple pie.\u201d On top of widespread opposition, basic math has gotten in the way . The federal government often operates public lands at a loss: The Bureau of Land Management, for instance, regularly spends 10 times as much managing grazing lands as it collects in fees. If states took over, they would bear the cost of essential services like wildfire management. That is noteworthy, Weiss said, because the areas under consideration lie in \u201cthe wildland-urban interface , the most dangerous place to build.\u201d That hasn\u2019t kept the idea from resurfacing. During Trump\u2019s first term, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke held a closed-door meeting to discuss transfers with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative think tank that favors giving states control of federal land. Zinke opposed the notion, but still oversaw the largest giveaway of the modern era. (One of the scandals that eventually led to his resignation involved a real estate deal with the chairman of oil services company Halliburton while it benefited from unprecedented federal leases.) Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee has emerged as a leading advocate for reducing federal land ownership. In 2022 and again in 2023, he introduced legislation authorizing the sale of government land to developers. He also supported a lawsuit seeking state control of 18.5 million acres held by the Bureau of Land Management; the Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January. Read Next In Wyoming, tribal protests prevent land transfer \u2014 for now Taylar Dawn Stagner Meanwhile, Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for Trump\u2019s second term, laid the groundwork for the latest push. The chapter on the Interior Department was written by William Pendley, who led the Bureau of Land Management during Trump\u2019s first term and once argued that the \u201cFounding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold.\u201d It calls the government \u201ca bad manager of the public trust\u201d and proposes sweeping changes, including weakening environmental protections and increasing drilling, mining, and logging on public land. Kathleen Sgamma, who was Trump\u2019s pick to lead the bureau until she withdrew from consideration last week, also contributed to the chapter. The oil and gas lobbyist previously signaled her support to offload the country\u2019s land. When a dispute over federal grazing fees prompted a standoff between ranchers and the bureau in Oregon, she said the incident \u201carises from too much federal ownership of land in the West.\u201d In the meantime, Katharine MacGregor, vice president of fossil fuel-focused NextEra Energy, was confirmed as a deputy interior secretary in April. During her nomination hearing, MacGregor promised support for over a decade of oil and gas leases . (Watchdog group Fieldnotes found she had systematically concealed public records during her previous time at the Interior, concealing information about her extensive interactions with oil and gas executives.) Burgum also told oil and gas executives in March that selling public land could eliminate the $35 trillion (and growing) national debt. Even as Burgum positions such deals as a solution to the nation\u2019s woes, critics warn that the lack of safeguards could lead to unintended consequences. There is nothing to suggest the joint task force or the Trump administration will take steps to \u201cprevent those [housing developments] from just turning into vacation homes for billionaires,\u201d Weiss said. And many of the federal employees who would oversee the venture have recently been fired. The Trump administration intends to cut Housing and Urban Development by 84 percent , and has frozen $60 million in funding for other affordable housing developments, stalling hundreds of projects. \u201cAt every level, it\u2019s a scam and a con,\u201d Hartl said, \u201cand the only people that will benefit from it are the people that already benefit from the housing crisis.\u201d A message from All donations DOUBLED for a limited time Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Written by Radhika Parashar , Edited by Siddharth Suvarna | Updated: 15 April 2025 14:10 IST Photo Credit: Apple The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) oversees crypto-related registrations in the country Highlights South Korea is tightening oversight over crypto activities The aim is to protect its investor community and national financial stabi In March, Seoul asked Google to block some crypto apps from Play Store Advertisement South Korea is taking serious steps to curb the operations of unregistered crypto businesses in the country. This week, Apple blocked the apps of 14 crypto exchanges from its App Store in South Korea for not being in compliance with the country's licensing regime. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) confirmed the development this week, claiming that KuCoin and MEXC are among the affected exchanges. The development is in alignment with Seoul's efforts to make its crypto ecosystem safe for investors and curb the risks against national financial stability. All 14 blocked exchanges are based overseas and were offering unregistered crypto products and services in South Korea, the announcement said. The national Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) coordinated with Apple to have these unregistered exchanges restricted for download. This implies that the impacted apps can neither be installed anymore nor can they be updated. The financial authorities of South Korea have detailed criteria for judging domestic business activities of foreign crypto firms. Google Says All EU Crypto Ads Should Be MiCA-Compliant By This Date \u201cWhether a Korean website is provided, whether there are marketing events to attract Korean customers, whether payment in Korean Won is supported, etc. are taken into consideration when making a decision,\u201d the FSC explained. The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) oversees crypto-related registrations in the country. Unregistered crypto businesses lack government protection and can pose financial risks to the users. Businesses identified flouting regulatory mandates can face up to five years in prison along with a fine of KRW 50 million (roughly Rs. 30 lakh). Despite these potential outcomes, South Korean authorities have time and again caught crypto firms violating mandates. The FSC said, it blocked 16 unregistered abroad-based crypto firms in 2022 and six more in 2023. EU Regulator Warns of Crypto-Linked Financial Stability Risks \u201cIn the future, FIU will continue to block domestic access through mobile applications (apps) and Internet sites of overseas unreported virtual asset operators in order to prevent money laundering risks and user damage in consultation with relevant organisations,\u201d the FSC added. Earlier in March, Google's Play Store blocked 17 foreign crypto exchanges, including KuCoin, from being installed on Android devices in the country. As of now, it remains uncertain whether Seoul will set a compliance timeline for the affected exchanges or slap them with fines. Meanwhile, the government of South Korea has asked crypto investors to only engage with registered and licensed entities. The FIU maintains a list of registered crypto platforms on its homepage . \u201cWhen dealing with unreported businesses you may be exposed to risks such as personal information leaks and hacking, and there is a risk that you may be used as a money laundering channel as you are not subject to anti -money laundering management and supervision,\u201d the FSC noted. As of April 11, a total of 28 virtual asset business operators are officially recognised in South Korea.

While some of the tasks, such as mopping, can already be automated, the industry is now preparing for even more advanced robots. One such company, Chinese vacuum brand Beijing Roborock Technology Co, is trying to be part of the next wave of consumer offerings and is preparing to release what it calls the Saros Z70, one of the first devices to include a robotic arm. In a demonstration, the company showed how the arm can pick up small items like socks, slippers, tissues and hand towels. The device first generated advance buzz earlier this year at the CES technology conference, where it performed a sock pickup in front of thousands of onlookers. The addition of a robotic arm makes it unique compared with other robotic devices currently on the market, which mostly includes automated vacuum cleaners and mops from companies like Roomba maker iRobot Corp, Dyson Group Plc and Eufy. While the Roborock device was one of several to include motorised arms at CES, it\u2019s among the only such devices that consumers will soon be able to actually purchase. But at US$1,900 (RM8,385, before possible tariff price hikes), it\u2019s far more expensive than a Roomba, which can cost only a few hundred dollars. While a demonstration this month was impressive, it still underscored that home robots are in their early stages even as they begin to go on sale. It\u2019s an area that some of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies, including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Meta Platforms Inc and Apple Inc are exploring. The search engine giant and social networking company are both working on AI systems to power third-party robots, while the iPhone maker is testing its own smart home display that can move around on a robotic arm. In the demo, the Roborock robot, which a human presenter kept referring to as \"he\u201d, initially sat still, processing the objects laid out in front of it. Eventually, it started moving at a crawling, unthreatening pace. It then stopped just shy of one item \u2013 a sock \u2013 and reached forward with a skinny mechanical arm to snatch it off the floor. The Saros Z70 was slow and deliberate, but eventually recognised the items in front of it and was able to successfully pick them up using its five-axis arm. Still, it would have been much faster for a human to just move the item. The robotic vacuum, which also has a mopping mode, has several restrictions when it\u2019s being used to move objects. For safety reasons, the mechanical arm is not activated by default, and requires an authentication process involving a series of button presses on the robot itself. Additionally, the vacuum will only pick up the small list of objects it is designed to handle. A built-in weight sensor prevents it from lifting anything weighing more than 300 grams. The company has already received feedback suggesting it should add pet and children\u2019s toys to the list, but it\u2019s unclear when such functionality will be added, if ever. Before use, a customer needs to set up a designated zone where the robot can drop off things it\u2019s picked up. The device comes with a sorting box where the robot deposits most of the items it grabs. That particular container is required for the system to work, but the company plans to later expand to other types of bins. Right now, users can set up two sorting zones: one for shoes (no box required) and another for everything else (that\u2019s where the container comes in). Similar to a Roomba, the Saros Z70 can be programmed to automatically pick up stray items. If the scheduled routine also includes vacuuming or mopping, sorting will always come afterward, though there\u2019s an option for \"follow-up\u201d cleaning where the robot circles back to the spot where an object had been. Alternatively, there\u2019s a \"manual\u201d mode wherein you can review recognized objects in the app before the robot goes to inspect them. There\u2019s also a mode allowing the user to operate the Saros Z70 using on-screen controls in an accompanying iOS and Android app \u2013 the modern-day successor to a battery-operated remote-control car. In a demo, the vacuum was able to roll toward items and pick them up, but learning how to move the robot back, forward and side to side required some trial and error. While the device is technically ready for consumers \u2013 it works as advertised \u2013 the underlying technology is still in its early stages. Roborock plans to add more features, including support for expanded object recognition, through future software updates. The product will receive at least two such updates even before it goes on sale, according to the company. \u2013 Bloomberg Open Modal \u00d7 Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

Car rental giant Hertz Corporation disclosed a data breach that impacted its Hertz, Thrifty, and Dollar brands. Threat actors gained access to customer data via Cleo zero-day exploits in late 2024. \u201cCleo is a vendor that provides a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. On February 10, 2025, we confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo\u2019s platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\u201d reads the data breach notification published by the company. \u201cHertz immediately began analyzing the data to determine the scope of the event and to identify individuals whose personal information may have been impacted.\u201d According to data breach notification shared with the Maine\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office, 3,409 Maine residents were affected. The notifications were also sent to California and Vermont, though both states don\u2019t disclose the number of affected individuals. In January 2025, the Clop ransomware group added 59 new companies to its leak site, the gang claimed to have breached them by exploiting a vulnerability \u200b\u200bin Cleo file transfer products . In December 2024, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability CVE-2024-50623 (CVSS score 8.8), which impacts multiple Cleo products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog . The vulnerability affects the following products LexiCom before version 5.8.0.21, Harmony prior to version 5.8.0.21, and VLTrader prior to version 5.8.0.21. On December 9, reports of active exploitation targeting Cleo file transfer software began circulating among cybersecurity community. Security firm Huntress publicly disclosed ongoing exploitation involving three different Cleo products. Huntress researchers created a proof of concept and learned the patch does not mitigate the software flaw. The experts warned that fully patched systems running 5.8.0.21 are still exploitable. The Clop ransomware group claimed to have contacted the breached organizations, but they ignored ransom negotiations, so the gang threatens to publish stolen data on January 18, 2025. In January, a spokesperson for U.S. car rental giant Hertz told TechCrunch that it is \u201caware\u201d of Clop\u2019s claims, but added there is \u201cno evidence that Hertz data or Hertz systems have been impacted at this time.\u201d Hertz confirmed on April 2, 2025, that a breach exposed customer data, including names, contacts, DOB, credit card, driver\u2019s license information and information related to workers\u2019 compensation claims. A small number of people may have had their SSNs, government IDs, passport info, medical IDs, or injury-related claim data exposed in the breach. Hertz confirmed Cleo addressed the breach, notified law enforcement and regulators, and offers 2 years of free Kroll identity monitoring. The company hasn\u2019t detected any misuse of the exposed data but advises affected individuals to stay vigilant, monitor accounts and credit reports, and report any suspicious activity. Clop group already targeted enterprise file transfer software in the past, a large-scale hacking campaign exploited vulnerabilities in MOVEit Transfer and GoAnywhere .

Rights to Marion\u2019s upcoming book The Overnoise has been snapped up by Nine Perfect Strangers maker Made Up Stories , whose bosses Bruna Papandrea and Steve Hutensky will produce alongside Jeanne Snow and Claudia Park. Per the synopsis, \u201c The Overnoise follows aspiring musician Robin Conway, who simply wants to complete her new album and maintain her record deal. Everything changes with the launch of \u2018Infinite Connection\u2019 \u2013 a revolutionary global wireless service promising seamless connectivity worldwide. However, the technology brings an unexpected and disturbing consequence: a persistent dissonant hum known as the \u2018overnoise.'\u201d Related Stories Casting Cameras Roll On 'Ghosts Australia' At Network 10 & Paramount; Cast Set News Australia's Magpie Pictures Options Emma Grey Novel 'Pictures Of You' & Appoints Quan Phung And Fiona Eagger As Advisors This is the second collab between Isaac and Papandrea, following the feature film adaptation of Warm Bodies , the New York Times bestseller, in 2013.

Watch on Deadline \u201cMaking a \u2018zombie romance\u2019 work on screen was an absurdly tall order, but Bruna sank her teeth into it and created a genuine classic,\u201d said Marion. \u201cShe\u2019s never been afraid to tackle unusual stories with unique and exciting challenges, so I\u2019m thrilled to be working with her again to bring The Overnoise to life.\u201d Marion is known for the four-volume Warm Bodies series, first published in 2010, but also operates a YouTube channel. He lives in a remote cabin in the Washington wilderness, sharing stories about his life on the channel, Outer Edge Outpost, which currently has around 20,000 subscribers. \u201cWe knew The Overnoise was special from the first page,\u201d added Made Up Stories in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Isaac again on this brilliant, emotionally resonant story about the cost of progress and the value of human connection. We can\u2019t wait to bring this powerful narrative to the screen.\u201d Made Up Stories \u2013 which has bases in Australia , the U.S. and UK \u2013 is beind the likes of Prime Video miniseries The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart , which was the streamer\u2019s top-performing Australia originally globally, and Tell Me Your Secrets ; HBO\u2019s The Undoing ; Netflix\u2019s Anatomy of a Scandal , Toni Collette-starrer Pieces of Her and Jessica Knoll novel adaptation Luckiest Girl Alive ; Hulu\u2019s Nine Perfect Strangers ; Australian crime feature The Dry, starring Eric Bana, and its sequel, Force of Nature: Dry 2 ; Penguin Bloom , starring Naomi Watts, Andrew Lincoln and Jacki Weaver; Binge comedy Strife ; Apple TV+ anthology series Roar ; genre-bending rom-com series Wolf Like Me for Peacock and Stan; unscripted series Undressed for Paramount+; and, most recently, another Liane Moriarty adaptation, The Last Anniversary for AMC+ and Foxtel/Binge.

Over the past year, we\u2019ve revealed the news Made Up Stories has optioned rights to Zoe Foster Blake\u2019s novel Things Will Calm Down Soon , Sally Hepworth\u2019s crime thriller Darling Girls for TV and Emily Perkins\u2019 hot novel Lioness , which is being adapted alongside The Mentalist actor Simon Baker and agent-producer Lee-Ann Higgins. Also on the slate is a film version of Fiona McIntosh\u2019s book The Pearl Thief , with Nick Drake attached to write.

III State Title game but did make their third-straight state appearance. That team was anchored by standout ace and lefty Otto Solorzano and another standout, \u2018Primetime\u2019 Shane Coblentz. Both had filthy stuff and made life hard for opponents and now, a year later, the spotlight is firmly locked on Coblentz. He is a big reason many believe the Golden Bears could be headed back to the title game and are off to a 7-0 start. Just two years ago, they were back-to-back state champions in Div. III and now are seeking to win their third title in four years. Last year, Coblentz finished with a 9-0 record, a miniscule 0.50 ERA and he struckout 131 in just 77 \u2153 innings of work. \u201cHe has really good stuff to start with,\u201d said Waynedale coach Lucas Daugherty. \u201cAdd on a few years of experience as a starting varsity pitcher, he\u2019s just getting more and more comfortable out there. He\u2019s learning how to pitch more, gaining confidence and anytime he goes out there, he sets the tone. The other team has to work really hard to get runs and we know he\u2019s going to give us a good start.\u201d The right-hander hasn\u2019t disappointed either, no matter the weather conditions as the cold has been tough early this spring. As of Saturday, Coblentz has fanned 38 over 17 innings, posted a 4-0 record, allowed one run total, walked just four and has an ERA of 0.41. At the dish, he isn\u2019t too bad either, hitting .364, with three doubles, a pair of homers, seven RBIs and scored 11 runs. \u201cThe scary thing is, he is only going to get better as the season goes on,\u201d said fellow senior and catcher Tristan Franks. \u201cHe can throw any pitch for a strike at any time, he has five or six pitches, and it keeps hitters on their toes. They never know what\u2019s coming.\u201d That was evident when Coblentz made his debut in the season opener against Marlington, working three innings and striking out nine. Three days later, he tossed a two-hit complete-game shutout over WCAL rival and title contending Norwayne with 13 strikeouts. One would never know that even Coblentz hasn\u2019t exactly enjoyed the cold weather. \u201cIt definitely affects you,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially with pitching, you can\u2019t grip the ball, and you can\u2019t feel your fingers. When it\u2019s warmer, you feel your fingers more and really get a better grip on the baseball.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling that is shared mutually between hitters and pitchers, Daugherty said. \u201cThese early temperatures, it's tough to get going for pitchers and all players. As it gets warmer, it tends to get easier and sometimes a little bit more fun to play in, so we expect him to slowly but surely, just get stronger.\u201d He also battled some arm injuries early on, but has it cruising in the right direction now. \u201cEarly on, I had some arm stuff to work through,\u201d said Coblentz. \u201cBut recently, it\u2019s been a lot better and that has helped me pitch so much better, not having to work through that.\u201d Another key contributing factor for Coblentz is the man behind the plate, Franks. \u201cWe have a special bond,\u201d smiled Coblentz. \u201cWe know what pitches I want to throw before he even calls it, I barely have to shake him off, if at all. He\u2019s a great defender and a great leader on this team; he leads out way better than I do, and I am very grateful for him.\u201d That feeling is definitely mutual. \u201cTo me, Shane is like a brother,\u201d said Franks. \u201cOn the mound, in the field at the plate, you trust him. With him hitting leadoff and me hitting second, we kind of work together, he gets on, I move him over, he scores and we\u2019re both yelling in the dugout, Shane is like a brother to me.\u201d Franks has caught Coblentz for some years and is the perfect evaluator to the level that Coblentz is at right now. \u201cThis is as good as I\u2019ve seen him and I am so excited for the end of the year,\u201d said Franks. \u201cThat\u2019s when he really gets rolling, it\u2019s playoff time Shane, that\u2019s \u2018Primetime\u2019 Shane right there.\u201d Facebook Twitter Email", "sentiment": "POSITIVE", "sentiment_score": 0.9, "url": "https://www.the-daily-record.com/story/sports/high-school/baseball/2025/04/15/shane-coblentz-already-in-playoff-form-for-waynedale/83071395007/", "source": "Wooster Daily Record", "published_at": "2025-04-15T08:02:15"}, {"id": 1299, "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Made Large Stock Purchases Ahead Of Trump's 90-Day Tariff Pause: Hakeem Jeffries Calls It 'Problematic'", "content": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Made Large Stock Purchases Ahead Of Trump's 90-Day Tariff Pause: Hakeem Jeffries Calls It 'Problematic' Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Upgrade Now Marjorie Taylor Greene Made Large Stock Purchases Ahead Of Trump's 90-Day Tariff Pause: Hakeem Jeffries Calls It 'Problematic' Namrata Sen Tue, Apr 15, 2025, 3:00 AM 2 min read Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) disclosed her significant stock purchases made just before and on the day of President Donald Trump \u2018s announcement to pause global tariffs. This announcement had a substantial impact on the stock market. What Happened : Based on the information disclosed to the House, Greene bought stocks valued between $21,000 and $315,000 on April 8 and 9. On April 8, she also sold Treasury bills worth between $50,000 and $100,000, according to the Benzinga Government Trades tracker. Greene\u2019s stock purchases included shares in several companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which has since appreciated by approximately 5%. She also invested in other tech firms, energy companies like Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN ), and pharmaceutical giant Merck & Company (NYSE: MRK ). On April 8, Greene bought stocks in Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR ) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ). These transactions occurred as government bond yields were on the rise amidst the tariff turmoil. Here's a look at the stocks Greene purchased during the period: Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT ) ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ: ASML ) Blackstone Inc. (NYSE: BX ) Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI ) Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN ) FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) Merck & Company (NYSE: MRK ) Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE ) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR ) Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO ) Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) SEE ALSO : Jensen Huang Praised By Trump: Nvidia \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Be Doing\u2019 $500 Billion AI Infrastructure Commitment Without Tariffs Why It Matters : Greene\u2019s stock trades have raised eyebrows, especially considering the timing of her purchases. The trades coincided with former President Trump\u2019s tariff pause announcement, which led to a significant surge in the stock market. This has led to calls for an investigation into potential insider trading related to President Trump\u2019s market communications before the tariff pause announcement. Key Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have expressed concerns about possible corruption. Schiff and Warren pointed out a post on Truth Social where Trump encouraged buying stocks just hours before the tariff pause announcement that sent markets soaring. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York urged a ban on stock trading by members of Congress following the revelation of Ms. Greene's investment activities. He told MSNBC on Monday, \"We obviously have to continue to highlight why this is problematic.\" Story Continues READ MORE: Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos Once Made His Grandmother Cry Trying To Show Off His Math Skills \u2014 That Day, His Grandfather Gave Him A Life-Changing Piece Of Wisdom Image via Shutterstock Disclaimer : This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

The latest PYMNTS Intelligence in the March 2025 \u201cBusiness Payments Tracker\u00ae\u201d series reveals that in a push to modernize business payments and mirror the seamless experience consumers enjoy , companies are merging virtual cards with mobile wallets . This tech-forward combo, the report found, can help give businesses tighter control over spending while simultaneously offering the kind of convenience, speed and flexibility that\u2019s redefining B2B transactions in the digital age. Crucially, this convergence of virtual card technology and mobile wallet functionality signals a shift, moving B2B payments from slow, manual processes to seamless, real-time solutions. For businesses grappling with supply chain pressures, remote operations, and rising expectations for transparency, this integration is more than just a technological upgrade: it\u2019s a strategic imperative. That\u2019s because embracing this evolution signals reflects a willingness to innovate at the intersection of finance and technology by turning a once-tedious back-office function into a strategic enabler of growth . Mobile Wallet Moment in B2B While mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Wallet are already deeply embedded in the consumer ecosystem, their role in the B2B space has been comparatively underdeveloped. Historically, B2B payments have lagged behind in digital adoption, hamstrung by legacy systems, complex approval hierarchies, and entrenched habits like writing checks or initiating bank wires. But this is changing. Virtual cards, which are unique, single-use or limited-use card numbers issued for specific transactions, are now being paired with mobile wallet platforms to empower employees to make controlled, trackable payments directly from their smartphones. This functionality eliminates the need for plastic corporate cards or manual expense reports and brings a new level of flexibility to B2B transactions. The fusion of mobile wallets and virtual cards addresses three persistent pain points in B2B payments: speed, control and security. Speed is perhaps the most obvious benefit. Traditional accounts payable processes can take days \u2014 or even weeks \u2014 from invoice approval to payment settlement. By contrast, virtual cards issued through mobile wallets can be generated and used instantly, expediting payment cycles and improving cash flow for both buyers and suppliers. Control is equally compelling. Finance teams can predefine the use of each virtual card by setting spending limits, expiration dates and merchant categories. These parameters help organizations mitigate fraud, enforce policy compliance, and simplify reconciliation. For mobile wallets, the real-time nature of notifications and transaction tracking allows for immediate visibility into spend patterns and exceptions. Then there\u2019s security. Virtual cards reduce the risk of fraud compared to physical cards or bank transfers. Each card number is ephemeral, often valid for a single transaction, which limits exposure in case of compromise. When integrated into mobile wallets, these cards benefit from the additional security layers of biometric authentication, tokenization and encrypted storage.

In construction, field teams can quickly procure materials without waiting for head office approval. In media production, mobile wallets simplify travel and on-site expenses for fast-moving crews. Even professional services firms are using the technology to streamline client-specific project budgets. At the same time, the technology proves beneficial in crisis response scenarios, such as natural disasters or emergency procurement, where speed and flexibility are paramount. By issuing virtual cards directly to mobile wallets, organizations can empower field personnel to act immediately, without compromising financial oversight. The integration of mobile wallets into corporate finance workflows also reflects broader demographic shifts. As millennials and Gen Z professionals assume greater responsibility in procurement and budget management, their expectations around payment experiences are influencing enterprise standards. These digital-native employees expect the same frictionless, mobile-first tools in the workplace that they use in their personal lives. Ultimately, integrating mobile wallets with virtual card capabilities isn\u2019t just about digitizing a single process: it\u2019s about enabling enterprise agility. In a world where business conditions can shift overnight, the ability to authorize, issue and reconcile payments instantly gives companies a crucial edge.

While some users report improved battery longevity, others have encountered rapid battery drain, sparking discussions about the update\u2019s overall impact. Understanding these mixed outcomes and adopting proactive measures can help you better manage your device\u2019s battery. The video below from iDeviceHelp gives us more insights into the factors influencing battery life, user feedback, practical optimization strategies, and what to anticipate from the upcoming iOS 18.4.1 update. Watch this video on YouTube . Battery Performance: User Experiences and Device Variability Feedback from iPhone users regarding iOS 18.4 battery performance reveals a divided experience. A recent survey indicates that 69% of users are satisfied with their battery life, while 31% report noticeable issues. These results underscore the role of device-specific factors and individual usage patterns in shaping battery performance. For instance: The iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Pro Max generally exhibit stable battery performance, with minimal complaints from users. The iPhone 16 Pro Max , however, has shown inconsistent results, with some users reporting faster-than-expected battery drain. Older devices often experience a more pronounced impact on battery life due to hardware limitations, while newer models are typically optimized for the latest software. This variability highlights the importance of customizing your device settings to align with your specific model and usage habits. Background App Activity: A Key Contributor to Battery Drain One of the most common causes of battery drain following the iOS 18.4 update is excessive background app activity. Apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp frequently refresh content in the background, consuming energy even when not actively in use. This behavior can significantly impact battery performance, especially for users who rely on multiple apps throughout the day. To mitigate this issue, you can: Disable background app refresh: Navigate to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and turn it off for non-essential apps. Restrict background activity: Limit this feature to critical apps that require real-time updates, such as email or messaging platforms. Implementing these changes can lead to noticeable improvements in battery life, particularly for users who frequently use apps with high background activity. Usage Patterns and Their Impact on Battery Life Battery performance is also heavily influenced by how you use your device. Many users have reported satisfactory results with iOS 18.4, particularly in terms of screen-on time and overnight battery retention. However, activities such as gaming, video streaming, or prolonged use of resource-intensive apps can quickly deplete the battery. Conversely, moderate use of productivity apps or light browsing tends to preserve battery life. If you notice a sudden decline in battery performance, consider analyzing your usage patterns: Review energy consumption: Go to Settings > Battery to identify which apps are consuming the most energy. Address high-energy activities: Adjust your usage habits or limit time spent on apps that contribute to rapid battery drain. By understanding how your activities impact battery life, you can make informed adjustments to maximize efficiency and extend usage time. Anticipated Improvements with iOS 18.4.1 Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4.1 in the near future, which may address some of the battery-related concerns raised by users. While specific details about the update remain undisclosed, it is likely to include bug fixes and performance enhancements aimed at improving battery efficiency and overall device stability. If you are experiencing persistent battery issues, updating to the latest version as soon as it becomes available is a recommended step. Regular updates often include optimizations that can resolve software inefficiencies and enhance your device\u2019s performance. Effective Strategies for Battery Optimization To ensure your iPhone operates efficiently and maintains optimal battery life, consider implementing the following strategies: Disable background app refresh: Turn off this feature for apps that do not require constant updates. Adjust screen brightness: Lower the brightness manually or enable auto-brightness to adapt to ambient lighting conditions. Manage location services: Restrict location access for apps that do not need it, reducing unnecessary energy consumption. Enable Low Power Mode: Activate this feature during periods of heavy usage or when your battery is running low. Keep your software updated: Regular updates often include improvements that enhance battery performance and address known issues. These practical adjustments can help you extend your device\u2019s battery life and minimize the impact of software-related inefficiencies, making sure your iPhone remains reliable throughout the day.

The region has become a hot spot for innovation, with digital wallets, account-to-account (A2A) transfers and buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions rapidly gaining traction. By 2030, digital payments are expected to account for two-thirds of the region\u2019s eCommerce transaction value and nearly half of its point-of-sale (POS) value. Cash usage has plummeted over the past decade, signaling a dramatic shift toward digital-first transactions. FinTechs and government-backed initiatives are driving Latin America\u2019s digital payments revolution, with solutions like Worldpay, Pix and Mercado Pago leading the charge. These efforts have promoted financial inclusion by enabling previously underserved populations to access formal financial services and participate in the digital economy. As a result, digital wallets and apps are becoming the preferred payment methods for many consumers. With innovative solutions and cross-sector collaboration paving the way, Latin America is emerging as a global leader in digital payment adoption \u2014 positioned for a more inclusive and digital financial landscape. Digital Payments Take Latin America by Storm Mobile Wallets and Apps Advance Purchasing and Financial Inclusion FinTechs and Governments Drive Instant Payment Adoption Latin America\u2019s Digital Payments Momentum Is Just Getting Started Digital Payments Take Latin America by Storm Digital payments in Latin America have surged in popularity in recent years and are now on the verge of displacing more traditional payment options like cash. Digital payments are quickly supplanting cash as the payment method of choice in Latin America. A recent survey found that digital payments accounted for 48% of eCommerce transaction value and 30% of POS transaction value in Latin America in 2024, a significant increase from 14% and 2%, respectively, in 2014. By 2030, experts project that digital payments will represent 66% of online purchase value and 49% of in-store transaction value. Meanwhile, cash\u2019s share of in-store transaction value has dropped sharply \u2014 from 67% in 2014 to 25% in 2024. By 2030, it\u2019s expected to fall further to just 17%, reflecting the growing preference for cashless payment methods. 64B payments were recorded on Brazil\u2019s Pix real-time payment system in 2024. A2A transfers and digital wallets are key drivers of this shift. In 2024, A2A transfers via real-time payment rails made up 24% of eCommerce transaction value and 15% of point-of-sale (POS) transaction value. Digital wallets are the fastest-growing payment method for in-store transactions, with their transaction value projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from 2024 to 2030. Credit cards remain a prominent payment method online and in-store, accounting for 30% of eCommerce transaction value and 24% of POS transaction value in 2024. However, like cash, they are losing ground to digital alternatives. By 2030, credit card usage is expected to decline to just 21% of eCommerce transaction value and 19% of POS transaction value. This trend underscores the rapid adoption of digital alternatives as consumers across Latin America embrace more convenient and accessible payment options. Brazil\u2019s Pix is a remarkable example of digital payments\u2019 surging popularity. Pix, the government-backed real-time payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil, has achieved unprecedented growth, becoming one of the country\u2019s most preferred payment methods. According to a recent report based on data from the Central Bank , Pix processed more than 6 billion transactions per month by the end of 2024, culminating in a total of 64 billion transactions for the year. This represents a 53% year-over-year increase, surpassing the combined total of debit and credit card transactions by 80%. On Dec. 20, Pix set a single-day record of 252.1 million transactions. Person-to-business (P2B) payments led the way, growing 94% year over year. Business-to-business (B2B) payment volume also grew, exceeding 1 trillion reals (approximately $178 billion) in December 2024, marking a 56% increase year over year. Looking ahead, Pix is set to roll out two major innovations to further boost adoption. First, it plans to introduce tap-to-pay functionality using near-field communication (NFC) technology, offering a seamless experience comparable to Apple Pay but without transaction fees. Additionally, Pix Automatic will launch in June 2025, enabling recurring payments for subscriptions, utilities and investments. Mobile Wallets and Apps Advance Purchasing and Financial Inclusion Mobile devices are rapidly becoming the preferred means and method for payments across Latin America, not only revolutionizing purchasing but also promoting financial inclusion. Mobile wallets and payment apps have become go-to payment tools in Latin America. 62% of Latin Americans use digital means, including mobile wallets , for regular payments. Digital payment methods, including mobile wallets , have surged across Latin America. A study reveals that 62% of the population frequently use mobile wallets and payment applications for transactions, with adoption rates highest in Argentina (65%), Panama (63%), Colombia (62%) and Peru (58%). In some cases, these digital channels have even surpassed debit cards in usage. Satisfaction with digital payment methods is also notable, with Argentina (78%) and Colombia (67%) leading as the countries where these technologies are most positively perceived. Additionally, another study highlights that P2P transfers are the most popular mobile wallet feature, with 78% of users sending and 71% receiving money via mobile devices. This shift reflects broader trends in Latin America\u2019s financial landscape as digital means and methods increasingly replace traditional payment methods like cash. The convenience and accessibility of mobile-based payments empower consumers to manage their finances more securely and efficiently, even in areas with limited banking infrastructure. Digital payments are promoting financial inclusion across the region. A recent report found that consumer adoption of fast payment systems \u2014 such as Brazil\u2019s Pix and Mexico\u2019s CoDi, which enable real-time or near-real-time transactions \u2014 are closely tied to mobile phone penetration, which exceeds 70% in Latin America. As a result, mobile-based payments have become a critical tool for financial inclusion, particularly among unbanked populations. By reducing reliance on cash and traditional banking infrastructure, digital payments empower small businesses and individuals in remote areas to engage in the digital economy. Additionally, digital payment systems help lower remittance costs, making these transactions more affordable for households that rely on them, and facilitate microtransactions that sustain daily economic activity. However, challenges remain, including uneven infrastructure in rural areas and regulatory hurdles that complicate regional payment integration. FinTechs and Governments Drive Instant Payment Adoption Instant payments are quickly becoming table stakes in Latin America, driven both by government initiatives like Pix in Brazil and private FinTechs like MODO in Argentina. The Latin American FinTech scene is growing at a blistering pace. Data from a recent survey shows that as of 2024 there are 3,069 FinTechs operating across 26 countries in the region, a sharp increase from the 703 FinTechs in 18 countries in 2017. Experts attribute this rapid growth to FinTechs seizing opportunities among traditionally underserved customer segments, including low-income families, younger consumers, and unbanked and underbanked individuals. Nearly half of respondents said FinTechs provided access to financial products and services that were previously unavailable, such as QR code and P2P payments, prepaid cards, BNPL solutions and international transfers. In terms of satisfaction, more than half of Latin Americans (52%) said they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the value FinTechs offer. Only 5% of respondents reported being unsatisfied. 3,069 FinTechs currently operate in Latin America . Government initiatives are spurring digital payment growth. Countries across the region have implemented programs to boost digital payment adoption among their populaces, ranging from pro-FinTech regulations and digitized subsidy payments to full government-sponsored instant payment systems like Brazil\u2019s Pix. Since its introduction, Pix has significantly boosted financial inclusion by encouraging the opening of digital accounts across all societal segments and integrating more individuals into the financial ecosystem. Governments have also boosted digital payment integration by enabling more widespread internet and mobile data access. At the close of 2023, 418 million Latin Americans, or 65% of the population, had access to mobile internet, a 75 million user increase over five years. In countries like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile, more than 80% of the population enjoys regular internet access. This demonstrates how improved digital infrastructure has supported financial inclusion in the region, with FinTechs playing a key role by introducing accessible and innovative digital platforms designed to meet the specific needs of Latin America\u2019s population. Latin America\u2019s Digital Payments Momentum Is Just Getting Started The rapid rise of digital payments in Latin America presents a compelling case for continued investment, innovation and collaboration across the financial ecosystem. From government-led systems like Brazil\u2019s Pix to FinTech-powered mobile wallets and peer-to-peer apps, digital solutions are reaching more consumers and businesses than ever \u2014 especially in underserved and remote communities. These platforms not only promote economic participation but also empower consumers with secure and convenient financial tools, reducing reliance on cash and enhancing financial literacy across the region. As adoption grows, digital payments are helping to boost purchasing power, foster eCommerce expansion and enable small businesses to reach more customers. However, sustaining this momentum will require continued investment in infrastructure, regulatory harmonization and public-private partnerships. Ensuring that digital payment solutions remain accessible, affordable and interoperable across Latin America will be key to long-term success. Stakeholders who act now can help shape a more inclusive and connected financial future for the region. The acceleration of digital payments across Latin America is more than a trend \u2014 it\u2019s a transformation. By combining mobile-first innovation with inclusive financial infrastructure, the region is not only closing access gaps but redefining what modern commerce looks like.

The April 15 order reiterates the FTC\u2019s earlier finding that the US tech giant took advantage of its position as the provider of the Google Play app ecosystem \u2013 the only viable alternative to the iPhone\u2019s App store. Google is improperly forcing local phone makers to prioritise its apps and services on their devices, the regulator said. The announcement comes just ahead of Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa\u2019s planned visit to the US this week to press for a reprieve from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Japanese products. The watchdog\u2019s move also follows a complaint by the Office of the US Trade Representative that Japan\u2019s Digital Platform Act \u2013 geared to boost transparency from large technology providers \u2013 disproportionately affects American companies and undermines their competitiveness in Japan by increasing compliance costs. While the US runs a goods deficit with Japan, it has a surplus in services, which includes licensing fees for Android\u2019s app ecosystem as well as advertising revenue. Last year, the US sold more than US$45bil (RM198.61bil) in seasonally adjusted services to Japan. Google allegedly capitalised on the struggles of Japanese smartphone makers to retain market share in a country where Apple Inc is by far the leading smartphone brand. Google demanded Japanese phone makers \u2013 which include Sony Group Corp and Sharp Corp \u2013 bundle the Chrome browser and promote it on each handset\u2019s home screen, according to the FTC. The manufacturers complied, because the Google Play app ecosystem is indispensable to deliver phones that can stand toe to toe with Apple\u2019s handsets. Mountain View, California-based Google also offered to share ad revenue with device makers if they agree not to preload search engines from its rivals, the FTC said. Google places a high priority on ensuring it\u2019s the first search service users see when they get a new phone, paying Apple billions each year to secure that spot on iPhones. Japan\u2019s cease-and-desist order marks the country\u2019s first such command to any leading US tech firm and follows examples set by regulators around the world. The EU has rebuked both Google and Apple for using what it alleges are illegal tactics to dominate mobile software markets, while the US Justice Department is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell off parts of its business after a federal judge ruled the company illegally monopolised the search market. Google in December said that it was disappointed in the Japanese watchdog\u2019s conclusions, and that it\u2019s proposed solutions to the regulator. \u2013 Bloomberg Open Modal \u00d7 Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

It has only confirmed that there won\u2019t be a OnePlus Open sequel this year. However, a new phone is in the pipeline, set to join the OnePlus 13 series on April 24. After posting several teasers, OnePlus has officially announced the release date for its next product, the OnePlus 13T. OnePlus China head Louis Jie took to Weibo to confirm the launch date of their upcoming smartphone. The OnePlus 13T is set to debut in China on April 24 at 2:30 PM local time.

However, it was later confirmed that the new utility would be delayed until next year . A new report has emerged that shares details on how Apple trains its AI models with reference to Apple Intelligence. Apple\u2019s AI models get smarter using synthetic emails while ensuring complete user privacy protection throughout Even though Apple officially stated that the Personalized Siri features will be delayed until next year, employees within the company are growing confident that the feature will be ready for launch later this year. In a new report, Bloomberg highlights how Apple trains its AI models for Apple Intelligence. The report cites a blog post from Apple's Machine Learning Research website, describing how Apple uses synthetic data to train its AI models. Related Story Apple\u2019s Foldable iPhone Will Have An Under-Screen Camera, But Will Not House All The TrueDepth Components Necessary For Enabling Face ID, Claims Tipster We have previously reported on several occasions that Apple is lagging behind in the AI race with its competitors, and the company's strategy to use synthetic data to train AI models is a bit unconventional and has limitations. For one, it is cumbersome for the data to \"understand trends\" when it comes to summarization or writing tools that require longer sentences or full-fledged emails. Apple took note of this and highlighted a new technology that will allow it to circumvent the limitations by comparing the synthetic data to a sample of recent user emails. However, the process does not compromise user privacy. To improve our models we need to generate a set of many emails that cover topics that are most common in messages. To curate a representative set of synthetic emails, we start by creating a large set of synthetic messages on a variety of topics. For example, we might create a synthetic message, \u201cWould you like to play tennis tomorrow at 11:30AM?\u201d This is done without any knowledge of individual user emails. We then derive a representation, called an embedding, of each synthetic message that captures some of the key dimensions of the message like language, topic, and length. These embeddings are then sent to a small number of user devices that have opted in to Device Analytics. Participating devices then select a small sample of recent user emails and compute their embeddings. Each device then decides which of the synthetic embeddings is closest to these samples. Using differential privacy, Apple can then learn the most-frequently selected synthetic embeddings across all devices, without learning which synthetic embedding was selected on any given device. These most-frequently selected synthetic embeddings can then be used to generate training or testing data, or we can run additional curation steps to further refine the dataset. For example, if the message about playing tennis is one of the top embeddings, a similar message replacing \u201ctennis\u201d with \u201csoccer\u201d or another sport could be generated and added to the set for the next round of curation (see Figure 1). This process allows us to improve the topics and language of our synthetic emails, which helps us train our models to create better text outputs in features like email summaries, while protecting privacy. While the company is aware of the limitations, it explains that the new technology will allow it to better understand the overall trends without compromising user privacy or gathering information. Bloomberg also claims that the company will release the new technology in a new beta of iOS 18.5 and macOS 15.5. You can check out Apple's full post on the matter for more details.

Thankfully, clear minds prevailed, and U.S. President Donald Trump has exempted the levies from the majority of the company\u2019s product range, which would otherwise be subject to 145 percent of additional charges. During an official meeting with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Trump made it a point that he helped Apple CEO Tim Cook, suggesting that the two had a meeting behind closed doors that ended up being fruitful. Trump says that he does not \u2018want to hurt anybody\u2019 when referring to how he helped out Tim Cook and Apple Shortly after the tariffs announcement, it did not take long for Apple to start suffering the aftershocks, which would ultimately force it to review all viable options to reduce the levies as much as possible, even if it meant shifting its entire supply chain to another region. Fortunately, the California-based giant does not have to bear that Herculean process because the company gained several exemptions that would allow it to continue pocketing those hefty margins. Related Story Apple\u2019s Foldable iPhone Will Have An Under-Screen Camera, But Will Not House All The TrueDepth Components Necessary For Enabling Face ID, Claims Tipster As reported by AppleInsider , Donald Trump met with Nayib Bukele and told reporters that he is a very flexible person, and even though he does not change his mind, there are moments when he can exercise a little leeway. The current U.S. President said that he spoke to Tim Cook and helped him out, putting an end to what could have been a grim fate because of the additional levies. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo highlighted that if the company chose to keep prices unchanged, it would suffer between an 8.5 to 9 percent drop in its gross margin . Morgan Stanley previously stated that because of the way the tariffs were structured, Apple would have a 20 percent chance of obtaining an exemption. With its chances slim, the firm was estimated to lose $33 billion in operating profits . Looking at the recent turn of events, the analysts were incorrect in their assessment, but as the trade wars with China rage on, President Donald Trump could change his mind in the future.

(She was the first Indian-American to run for Congress back in 2010). Saujani\u2019s lack of experience in coding didn\u2019t stop her from launching what has become one of the most well-known coding camps in tech. Girls Who Code says it has helped train more than 670,000 young girls, women, and nonbinary individuals in STEM and, at one point, received support from high-profile names in the tech industry, including Jack Dorsey and Microsoft. (The organization still seems to be kicking, whereas other groups, like Girls in Tech and Women in Code, have faced the reverberating impacts of the anti-DEI sentiment sloshing through Silicon Valley.) Saujani chatted with Meghan about her early days of building the organization, while touching upon themes of motherhood and life after leaving Girls Who Code. Her interview illustrates the sacrifices many female founders make \u2014 and often conceal \u2014 while they focus on running a business. The conversation revealed Saujani\u2019s drive as an entrepreneur to remain on the front lines pushing for change. \u201cThis conversation was such a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Saujani told TechCrunch, adding that she first met Meghan in 2019 when she was expanding Girls Who Code to the U.K. \u201cConfessions of a Female Founder\u201d promises to talk to important women and share lessons about building a business. The podcast, which launched last week, has had a successful beginning. It\u2019s currently the No. 1-ranked business podcast on Apple, ahead of Scott Galloway\u2019s \u201cThe Prof G Pod.\u201d Image Credits: Confessions of a Female Founder In a comment given to TechCrunch, Meghan said she hoped the conversation inspired others to \u201cexplore a different vertical of being an entrepreneur: social entrepreneurship.\u201d \u201cMy conversations throughout \u2018Confessions of a Female Founder\u2019 have each been illuminating in their own way, and with Reshma, we chat about what it looks like for a woman to lead and succeed while also navigating motherhood with grit and grace,\u201d she said. Saujani\u2019s conversation is at its best when business nuggets are dropped. For instance, the pair discussed the adage that when you go to someone for money, you get advice, but if you go to someone for advice, you will probably get money. \u201cYou\u2019re just going for advice, and then if it makes sense for them, they\u2019ll offer up what they think you might need,\u201d Meghan said. But there were intimate moments too; Saujani chatted about her struggles running the nonprofit while dealing with miscarriages and an auto-immune disorder. \u201cI was performing in front of these children that I desperately wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was eating me up inside.\u201d One of the main lessons in Saujani\u2019s founder journey is, of course, taking leaps and not giving up. She took her chance in 2012 when she launched Girls Who Code after seeing that young women, especially women of color, were not entering STEM jobs. A child of Indian immigrants, she spoke about how she was bullied as a child and how that impacted her path in life. \u201cI got beat up pretty bad,\u201d she said, adding that she tried hard to assimilate into the white culture she grew up around. \u201cBut I also realized I am not white, and I\u2019m never going to be, and I have a responsibility to actually teach people about difference [sic].\u201d Betting on women is another theme \u2014 and one worth reiterating. When Saujani launched her podcast, she thought it was important for young girls to have and understand the tools needed to solve the problems they will inevitably face. As the artificial intelligence revolution kicks off, betting on women has become more important than ever. Women make up just 22% of the global AI talent, with representation dropping as a role becomes more senior. AI is also threatening young women in unprecedented ways, most notably through the rise of shockingly accurate deepfake videos. (Girls Who Code says it has taught more than 8,000 students about AI.) Saujani, now a mother, went on to launch Moms First, which advocates for better working environments for moms. Meghan, she revealed, was an early supporter of the cause. The lesson there is a simple one. \u201cI might die with women having less rights than they had when I was born,\u201d she said, adding that she realized she, like other women, were probably put on earth to keep hope alive. \u201cYou lose, you lose, you lose, you lose, and then you win.\u201d This story was updated to clarify the year Saujani met Meghan and the name of Scott Galloway\u2019s podcast Topics girls who code , media , Media & Entertainment , Meghan Markle , reshma saujani , Startups Dominic-Madori Davis Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

While platforms like Pocket Casts and Apple Podcasts remain dominant, emerging contenders such as Sofa, Queue, Neuecast, and Fountain are introducing unique features that aim to redefine the listening experience. But how do these new apps measure up, and which one might align with your needs? Let\u2019s explore their offerings in detail in a new video from Stephen Robles Watch this video on YouTube . Sofa: Organize More Than Just Podcasts Sofa stands out by offering more than just podcast management. It serves as a comprehensive multimedia organizer, allowing users to track not only podcasts but also movies, TV shows, and books. This all-in-one approach makes it an appealing choice for those who enjoy managing various forms of entertainment in one place. Key features include: Custom chapter artwork for a personalized listening experience. Formatted show notes that make it easy to reference episode details. Smart lists to categorize and organize your content efficiently. Queue management and shortcuts integration for seamless navigation. However, Sofa has its drawbacks. It lacks a sleep timer, a feature many podcast enthusiasts rely on, and its playback navigation can feel unintuitive. Additionally, the subscription cost\u2014$4 per month or $30 annually\u2014might not appeal to budget-conscious users. Despite these limitations, Sofa\u2019s ability to manage multiple types of media makes it a strong contender for those seeking a versatile entertainment hub. Queue: Minimalism Meets Playfulness Queue is designed with simplicity and aesthetics in mind, offering a minimalist interface that is both functional and visually engaging. Its playful animations add a touch of charm, making the app enjoyable to use. The focus here is on ease of use, with basic playback features and limited queue management. That said, Queue has some notable limitations: No OPML import/export , which can be inconvenient for users migrating from other apps. Few customization options , which may leave power users wanting more. Priced at $4 per month or $30 annually, Queue is best suited for casual listeners who prioritize design and simplicity over advanced functionality. While it may not cater to heavy podcast users, its clean interface and playful design make it a delightful choice for those who value aesthetics. Neuecast: Swipe Actions and Streamlined Show Notes Neuecast takes a fresh approach to podcast management with its intuitive swipe actions and a dedicated \u201clinks\u201d section for quick access to show notes. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who frequently reference episode resources. Other notable features include: Customizable playback controls that allow users to tailor their listening experience. Episode queue management for better organization and control. Neuecast offers a mix of free and premium features, with the latter priced at $10 per year. While its affordability is a plus, the limited functionality of the free version may not appeal to users who prefer a fully-featured app without a subscription. Nevertheless, Neuecast\u2019s focus on streamlined navigation and enhanced show notes makes it a practical choice for listeners who value efficiency. Fountain: Advanced Features for the Engaged Listener Fountain positions itself as a forward-thinking app, offering features that go beyond traditional podcast listening. It caters to users who want a more interactive and engaging experience. Key highlights include: Transcriptions for improved accessibility and easy reference. Episode comments and clip sharing to foster community interaction. Live streaming capabilities for real-time engagement with creators. Wallet features that enable users to directly support their favorite podcasters. Despite its innovative offerings, Fountain has a few shortcomings. For instance, it does not display chapter artwork, which may disappoint users who appreciate visual elements in their podcast experience. However, its robust transcript capabilities and community-focused features make it a standout option for listeners seeking a more dynamic and interactive platform. How Do They Compare to Established Apps? While these new apps bring fresh ideas and unique features to the table, they face stiff competition from well-established platforms. Pocket Casts continues to be a favorite for its comprehensive queue management, transcript support, and extensive customization options. On the other hand, Apple Podcasts excels in design, universal transcription, and seamless integration with Apple devices, making it a top choice for iOS users. These established apps offer a level of reliability and functionality that newer entrants may struggle to match. Which App Is Right for You? Choosing the right podcast app depends on your specific needs and preferences. Each of these new apps caters to a distinct audience: Sofa : Perfect for users who want to manage podcasts alongside other media like movies and books. Queue : Ideal for casual listeners who value minimalist design and simplicity. Neuecast : A great option for those who prioritize enhanced show notes and intuitive swipe-based navigation. Fountain : Best suited for listeners seeking advanced features like transcriptions, live streaming, and community interaction. However, if you prioritize overall functionality and reliability, established apps like Pocket Casts and Apple Podcasts remain strong contenders. Ultimately, the best app for you will depend on how you prioritize features and what you value most in your podcast listening experience.

Crying, she anointed His feet with myrrh and received forgiveness for her sins from God. Her lamentation has a timeless power. Kassiani was the greatest Byzantine poetess. Emperor Theophilos was dazzled by her beauty, but before giving her the golden apple and choosing her as his wife, he wanted to test her intelligence. He told her that from woman come bad things, implying Eve and the original sin, to receive the reply that from woman also spring the best and noblest things, implying of course the Virgin Mary. The sharp-witted reply angered the emperor, and he chose the modest Theodora as his wife. Kassiani became a nun and dedicated herself to the worship of God. Her poetic works testify that love for Christ truly liberates the human being. The Hymn of Kassiani \u201cLord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, recognizing Your Divinity, took upon herself the role of the myrrh-bearer, and weeping, brings myrrh to You before Your burial. \u2018Woe is me!\u2019 she said, \u2018For night surrounds me, the frenzy of unchastity, dark and moonless, the love of sin. Receive the springs of my tears, You who draw the waters of the sea with the clouds. Incline to the groans of my heart, You who bowed the heavens in Your ineffable condescension. I shall kiss Your immaculate feet, and wipe them again with the tresses of my hair, those feet whose sound Eve heard in Paradise in the evening and hid herself in fear. The multitude of my sins and the abysses of Your judgments\u2014 who can fathom them, O soul-saving Savior? Do not overlook me, Your servant, You whose mercy is boundless.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe commemorate on Holy and Great Tuesday the parable of the ten virgins from the Holy Gospel.\u201d This is the synaxarion (liturgical reading) of the second day of Holy Week. The Bridegroom of the Church and Savior of human existence, \u201cmore beautiful in form than all the sons of men,\u201d goes toward His voluntary Passion, calling the faithful to draw near, so that He may make them partakers in the salvific sufferings and in the triumph of His Resurrection. \u201cHoly Tuesday\u201d by Nikos Gatsos >Related articles The Maritime Spatial Planning was announced Holy Wednesday: The Holy Unction and the Ceremony of the Washing of the Feet \u2013 What today\u2019s day symbolizes Weather: temperature rise until Holy Saturday \u2013 Where rain is expected on Easter Sunday Beneath the banners of Rome in Magdalene\u2019s tent, you\u2014father of forgiveness, and we\u2014children of pleasure.

When profits are hit, the commitment to worthy \u201csocial\u201d causes wobbles. If, for instance, profit hasn\u2019t been registered in the past three quarters, redundancies are on the cards and a director\u2019s stress levels are in the red zone, the consensus is that the social in ESG can be jettisoned. Of course, it\u2019s done quietly \u2013 what were once worthy back-slapping initiatives quietly slide out of view. But sustainability is one element of ESG that is here to stay. And if there\u2019s an area that channel players can adapt to burnish their green credentials, improve sustainability and drive more business, it\u2019s adopting circular economy practises. Materials are reused, recycled or repurposed instead of thrown away to reduce energy use, pollution and carbon emissions. Channel outfits typically come across sustainability in RFP/RFIs, and it can often appear little more than a tick-box exercise. For instance, you may be asked the question: \u201cIs sustainability part of your company practices?\u201d You might tick the \u201cyes\u201d answer without thinking about it beyond your vendor partners saying they have sustainability in their supply chains. Or you might tick the \u201cno\u201d box because you don\u2019t think the company does. Whatever your position, the need to show sustainability within the business is gathering pace. Governments worldwide are piling on the pressure by tightening environmental laws that deal with carbon emissions, waste reduction and supply chain transparency. Incorporating sustainability as an operational plank is becoming a business driving need. It\u2019s no longer enough to say you understand tech contributes to around 2% to 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, that it\u2019s as carbon-spewing mucky as the aviation industry, and that it could reach 14% of global emissions by 2040 if steps aren\u2019t taken. The time for talking the talk is passing. For the channel, as pressure builds walking the circular economy walk can potentially lead to business boosting benefits. Device life and death cycle If there is one significant step channel companies can take towards this end, it is in refurbishing and reselling used equipment. Jeff Kaiden, supply chain consultant and CEO of Capacity , says: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about saving money, it prevents unnecessary waste and reduces demand for new production, which cuts down on resource consumption. Many businesses already use refurbished IT equipment, and the demand keeps growing.\u201d According to Mohbeen Qureshi, vice-president of growth for offline marketing business Oppizi : \u201cNearly 60% of UK businesses now opt for refurbished tech over new devices, proving there\u2019s a strong market for recovered and renewed hardware.\u201d Producing smartphones, laptops and other devices requires significant energy, water and raw materials, such as rare earth metals, which are often sourced unsustainably. In fact, the production of devices such as smartphones and laptops is estimated to be around 30% of the total of tech industry carbon emissions. While 30% of total carbon emissions might seem like an unfeasibly high figure, consider that around 1.2 to 1.4 billion smartphones,160 to 200 million laptops, and 80 to 100 million new desktop PCs (not shipped) are manufactured each year. And adding oil to the fire, these devices have an average shelf life of around three years. Put this together and the perpetual cycle of device life and death results in massive carbon emissions. Nancy Powell, sustainability lead for HP EMEA, says: \u201cSustainability is a great opportunity for channel partners to distinguish themselves from competitors. For instance, taking back four-year-old devices, refurbishing and reselling, helps them to stand out from the crowd.\u201d Sustainability is a great opportunity for channel partners to distinguish themselves from competitors Nancy Powell, HP According to Gartner , HP ranked second in PC shipments in 2024 with 21.6% of the market, behind first place Lenovo with 25.5% of the market. In effect, this equates to approximately 53.5 million personal computers shipped worldwide by HP. Estimates vary on how many kilograms of CO 2 are released into the atmosphere for each PC that is manufactured, but the consensus is between 400kg to 800kg CO 2, with high-end models potentially exceeding 1,000kg CO 2 , with this number including production, transportation and usage phases. If we take 500kg CO 2 as an approximate average for each manufactured PC, and based on Gartner\u2019s figure of 245.4 million PCs shipped globally during 2024, it means 122.68 million metric tons of CO 2 was released into the atmosphere last year. To get a sense of how much CO 2 that is, imagine the emissions from around 26 million cars driving for a year. Calculating the carbon footprint of an electronic device is an extremely complex exercise, and manufacturers provide only shaky approximations, so while these figures are not exact, they are near enough to provide a sense of scale. Vendors such as HP, Lenovo, Dell, Apple, Acer, Asus and others are clearly aware of their CO 2 emissions, so it\u2019s not only in their interest to get channel partners to embrace the circular economy, but they also feel the weight of responsibility in the face of government pressures. This works in the favour of channel partners because manufacturers have developed programmes designed to help partners adopt sustainability practises. For instance, HP has its Amplify Impact programme, Lenovo its 360 Circle, and Asus its quirkily named Earthion platform, all of which make it easier for channel partners to embrace the circular economy. Take Lenovo\u2019s 360 Circle as an example. It says the partner programme \u201chelps \u2026 to align on common goals, best practices and sustainability strategies to offer a collective approach to success as a group, rather than leaving each business to its own journey in isolation\u201d. Mighty cooling tower As the world\u2019s leading PC manufacturer by market share, according to Gartner, Lenovo is chucking out CO 2 like a mighty cooling tower belching out steam. Its 360 Circle is clearly an acknowledgement of this, and the programme is designed to make it easier for partners to engage in the circular economy in a practical manner. Of course, not all vendor partner sustainability programmes are created equally. Programme maturity varies from vendor to vendor, whether they produce PCs, servers, networking equipment or other. S\u00e9bastien Juras, sustainability and transformation director at Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise , makes an obvious but easily overlooked point: \u201cAs part of a comprehensive sustainability strategy, channel vendors should evaluate their technology providers to ensure that they take the issue of e-waste seriously. \u201cMany electronics contain toxic materials that can contaminate soil and water supplies \u2026 they contain materials that are non-renewable, such as gold, silver and aluminium. According to the UN, 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced in 2022, and this is on track to increase to 82 million tonnes each year by 2030.\u201d To provide a sense of scale, that\u2019s the mass equivalence of around 8,000 Eiffel Towers. Many channel vendors will see sustainability as a trade-off \u2013 for instance, it could slow things down or make operations more costly and complex. But aligning with a vendor that has embedded sustainability into its strategy and has a focus on the channel could make it a lot easier to integrate sustainability into the business. And sustainability isn\u2019t just confined to hardware. Mphasis , an IT service and consulting company, extends its sustainability ethos to software engineering practices. Ashish Devalekar, senior vice-president, and head of European operations, says the company \u201cleverages digital transformation tools such as AI, IoT and cloud computing to optimise resource efficiency \u2026 [and] reduce waste\u201d, which is another way of saying sustainability is important to its operations. Tweaking web designers A further case in point is Ditto Umbraco , an open-source content management system built on .NET (ASP.NET Core) technology. In 2023, Umbraco began working with its channel partners to share sustainable web design practices. In short, web designers have been given the tools to make lots of tweaks that reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emitted by servers, data transfers and client devices. Panayot Kalinov, senior software developer at Casinoreviews.net , says in six years of leading dev teams he has seen sustainability become a critical issue in the tech industry: \u201cI\u2019ve seen how sustainability can influence purchasing decisions. It\u2019s not just about doing the right thing, it\u2019s about staying competitive. If a channel tech company wants to improve in this area, the best thing it can do is focus on a circular economy.\u201d It\u2019s easy to think of the drive towards sustainability as just more big stick compliance. But it\u2019s the implications of rising CO 2 emissions that has governments worried \u2013 the fear of cascading changes to ecosystems, economies and societies, ranging from health risks and threats to food and water supplies, to mass migration and conflict. Given the weighty implications a company that can put a sustainability badge on its credentials, even if it\u2019s offering refurbished and certified pre-owned equipment, it\u2019s likely to win more business. This may not be immediately evident, but as an example, HP\u2019s Nancy Powell, says: \u201cGiven that the public sector is [now] giving significant weight to sustainability, it can be a contract winner.\u201d But what about those channel companies that look at an RFP/RFI, see the sustainability tick box and think, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything sustainable\u201d? Well, think again. What about the office you\u2019re renting or own? Powell adds: \u201cOffice management increasingly incorporates sustainability practices, and in many cases, it\u2019s becoming a standard expectation. So, you may think you\u2019re not practicing sustainability when you are.\u201d Sustainability can influence purchasing decisions. It\u2019s not just about doing the right thing, it\u2019s about staying competitive Panayot Kalinov, Casinoreviews.net For instance, this can include smart lighting and heating, using eco-friendly office supplies, minimising single-use plastics, encouraging the use of reusable items, installing low-flow toilets and taps, prioritising green building certifications (such as Breeam) and more. So, you probably can tick that RFP/RFI box. Sustainability is pretty much a permanent fixture on C-suite agendas and, according to Geoff Greenlaw, vice-president of channel, EMEA and LATAM, at Pure Storage , it is \u201cone of the top three requirements in all tenders we see and has been for a number of years\u201d. This explains why Pure has ploughed a lot of resource into sustainability. \u201cOur technology is engineered to take up less space and use less power to operate, reducing datacentre footprint by up to 77% and saving customers up to 85% in energy use,\u201d adds Greenlaw. Engaging with a vendors sustainability programme requires partners to understand what the vendor wants to achieve. Does it have carbon reduction targets and/or dedicated circular economy initiatives such as recycling and refurbishing hardware? The aim is to get a sense of the vendor\u2019s objectives and how you can become part of the chain. Depending on your channel role ,a level of adaptation reflecting your operations may be required. The programme may need to be tailored to something that you can realistically achieve. For instance, if a vendor has a circular economy IT programme, you might need to provide logistics support for hardware returns and create a resale or refurb channel and a vendor should be able to help to facilitate changes. That said, channel companies ideally should see a clear business opportunity in a vendor\u2019s programme. If it\u2019s just a compliance task, you may feel burdened by sustainability expectations, rather than feeling supported. Adopting circular economy practises might seem like an onerous task, but it can be straightforward. Other than refurbishing and reselling IT equipment, channel companies can offer trade-in programs, encourage businesses to lease rather than purchase outright, partner with e-waste recycling firms, offer cloud-based tech to reduce the need for frequent hardware upgrades and more. If you don\u2019t want to go down the vendor sustainability route, independently adopting a few of these simple steps, and others, can put a channel vendor firmly on the sustainability map as well as providing a wider net to cast for new business, without putting directors in the red stress zone.

I couldn't figure out what was bothering me until now. I realised they didn't just look like very powerful attendees, they looked much more like very powerful shareholders in government - and unelected ones at that. We can see today where that power translates directly into US government policymaking with the reductions on certain tech tariffs from China . Let's look at what that means for Apple alone. With 90% of iPhones manufactured in China, Apple faced potential price increases of up to $3,500 per phone under the proposed 145% tariff. In 2024, US imports of smartphones from China were valued at $41.7bn while laptops were valued at $33.1bn. The tariff exemption therefore translates into avoided costs of approximately $60bn annually for these two categories alone. And while Apple will have only a share of that benefit, it's a staggering return for Tim Cook's donation of $1m to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee - which also marked Cook\u2019s first time attending a presidential inauguration, despite his political views often differing from Trump\u2019s policies. The Technocracy movement But it's not only tech\u2019s influence in policymaking areas such as tariffs that directly affect their bottom line, we need to think about their broader reach in the realm of geopolitics. Where did the ideas of making Canada the 51st State, or annexing Greenland actually emerge from? If there was a policy vacuum here it was neatly filled by none other than Elon Musk drawing on the ideas of his maternal grandfather Joshua Norman Haldeman. Haldeman was a key proponent of the Technocracy movement which started in the early 1930s in the US and then spread to Canada. It proposed the creation of the Technate of America . This would do away with borders, merging the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America and Greenland into a single nation under a regime of engineers and technicians. Sounds familiar, right? Its essential argument was that there was no room for politics in society and that engineers and scientists were best placed to decide what was best for citizens in terms of organising resources and society. In 2019 Musk tweeted on X, \u201cAccelerating Starship development to build the Martian Technocracy\u201d . Except now it looks like he is not waiting to do it on Mars, he's doing it here in real time. The idea of the futility of the nation state and of politics in favour of new technological frontiers is echoed in The sovereign individual published in 1997. This book examined the social, economic and political implications of the coming technology on society and particularly politics and governments. Authors James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg - father of Jacob Rees-Mogg - wrote, \u201cRepresentative democracy as it is now known will fade away to be replaced by the new democracy of choice in the cybermarketplace. If our deductions are correct the politics of the next century will be much more varied and less important than that to which we have become accustomed. The 20 th century nation-state will starve to death as its tax revenues decline,\u201d Or, as Mark Zuckerberg puts it, \u201cCompanies not countries\u201d. The authors also predicted the impact of coming technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) when they wrote, \u201cLifetime employment will disappear as jobs increasingly become tasks or piece work rather than positions within an organisation. New survival strategies will evolve involving greater concentration on the development of leisure skills, sports abilities as well as providing services to the growing numbers of sovereign individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises.\u201d Bypassing money The tome has had a substantial impact in Silicon Valley with Rees-Mogg travelling there more than a decade after the book's publication to discuss it with students at Stanford University. In 2014, PayPal founder and Trump advisor Peter Thiel told Forbes magazine that The sovereign individual had influenced him more than any other book . Indeed, in recently republished versions of the book Thiel has provided a new foreword. And Thiel\u2019s investments align with these principles where he believes that cryptocurrency ventures will bypass traditional monetary systems. Expect further policy reach in the future in the provision of universal basic income (UBI), which many of these tech bros are very keen on . They understand more than most how many professions are under threat and how many people will be left without work. What are people to do when their labour is no longer required? Perhaps they will spend their time in the fantasy worlds created by technologists, doomscrolling endlessly on Insta and other platforms while being paid by the government via UBI. This is what the author Jonathan Taplin tackles in his book The end of reality when he says \u201cThat is my greatest fear: that enchanted by the magic of the Technocrats\u2019 immutable money, infinite frontiers, eternal life we will sleep through a right-wing revolution and wake up to find our democracy gone and our children being turned into Meta cyborgs\u201d. And if you think having Trump as President of the United States with Elon Musk as his sidekick is a nightmare, ponder if you will the dystopian prospect of Mark Zuckerberg running for the highest office. Can you imagine the data he has amassed that could be used to further his political ambitions? What opponents might be suppressed or compromised? Yet as described in Sarah Wynn-Williams recent book Careless people , Zuckerberg has already paved the way for his political ambitions from as far back as 2017 when he finally realised how important Facebook was in the election of Donald Trump. In her insider account, Wynn-Williams wrote, \u201cHe also had Facebook\u2019s board approve a new stock structure that would allow him to run for office. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly allows Mark Zuckerberg to leave Facebook for up to two years without losing control of the company if his absence is \u2018in connection with his serving in a government position or office\u2019.\u201d Destroying democracy These are not benign actors, scrappy startup founders who move fast and break things - they share world views that are destroying our democracies as we know it. Yet politicians are in thrall to the power that these men yield. We may already be existing in the new technocracy for our times. They already decide how and when we should use their products, removing our choice and agency \u2013 consider the recent inclusion of Meta AI into WhatsApp, which you cannot turn off. Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, \u201cI'm from the government and I'm here to help.\u201d So if you hear, \u201cI\u2019m from the technocracy and I\u2019m here to help,\u201d you won't be surprised if it's our new form of government.

By Reuters | Updated: 15 April 2025 13:06 IST Photo Credit: Reuters Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line Highlights The FTC claims that Meta holds a monopoly on social networking platforms The trial could stretch into July Instagram generates more revenue per user than any other social platform Advertisement Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday at a high-stakes trial in Washington over US antitrust enforcers' claims that the company spent billions of dollars to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to fend off Facebook competitors. The FTC is seeking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp , testing President Donald Trump's promises to take on Big Tech while posing an existential threat to a company that by some estimates earns about half of its US advertising revenue from Instagram. Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Zuckerberg calmly responded to questions while seeking to combat allegations Meta bought the companies a decade ago to eliminate competition among social media platforms where users connect with friends and family. Why Apple's CEO Has Prioritised the Development of AR Glasses Zuckerberg emphasized that friends and family sharing was only one priority for the app along with discovering other content. In fact, a 2018 decision to prioritise Facebook content shared by users' friends over video posts and other public content failed to grasp a shift toward users sharing that content via messages instead of posting life updates in their feeds, Zuckerberg said. \"I think we misunderstood how social engagement online was evolving,\" Zuckerberg said. Meta Faces FTC Trial With Instagram, WhatsApp Breakup at Risk \"People just kept on engaging with more and more stuff that wasn't what their friends were doing,\" he said. He estimated that now around 20 percent of content on Facebook and 10 percent on Instagram is generated by users' friends as opposed to accounts they follow based on interests. Competition with TikTok The FTC has pointed to emails in which Zuckerberg proposed acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram as a way to neutralise a potential Facebook competitor and expressed worry that encrypted messaging service WhatsApp could grow into a social network. Meta has argued that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg's past statements are no longer relevant amid competition from ByteDance's TikTok , Google's YouTube and Apple's messaging app. How users spend time on social media and which services they consider interchangeable will be core to the case. Meta will argue that an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook during TikTok's brief shutdown in the United States in January shows direct competition. The FTC claims that Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued. US District Judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that the FTC \"faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial.\" The trial could stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to separately prove that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition. Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line. While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate $37.13 billion (roughly Rs. 3,18,328 crore) this year, a little over half of Meta's US ad revenue. Instagram also generates more revenue per user than any other social platform, including Facebook, according to Emarketer. WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue, but it is the company's biggest app in terms of daily users and is ramping up efforts to earn money off tools like chatbots. Zuckerberg has said that such \"business messaging\" services are likely to drive the company's next wave of growth. Trump v/s Big Tech The case is part of a crackdown on Big Tech started during Trump's first administration. Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating $1 million (roughly Rs. 8.5 crore) to Trump's inauguration. Zuckerberg has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google also face antitrust lawsuits by US enforcers. Several major tech companies have moved to align with Trump since the election, such as by rolling back diversity initiatives and having executives engage directly with the White House. While a shift from the combative tone the companies took during Trump's first term, it has not resulted in a pullback on the antitrust cases. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Security researchers at Huntress warn of attacks in the wild exploiting a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-30406 , in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox software. The vulnerability CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS score 9.0) is a deserialization issue due to the CentreStack portal\u2019s hardcoded machineKey use. Threat actors exploited the flaw in March attacks. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 16.4.10315.56368 released on April 3, 2025. \u201cThe application uses a hardcoded or improperly protected machineKey in the IIS web.config file, which is responsible for securing ASP.NET ViewState data. If an attacker obtains or predicts the machineKey, they can forge ViewState payloads that pass integrity checks. In some scenarios, this can result in ViewState deserialization attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the web server. Exploitation has been observed in the wild.\u201d reads the advisory . \u201cWe strongly recommend updating to the patched version, which improves key management and mitigates exposure. For customers who cannot update immediately, rotating the machineKey values is a recommended interim mitigation.\u201d The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog in April 2025. On April 11, 2025, Huntress detected suspicious activity linked to Gladinet CentreStack, tied to CVE-2025-30406. At least seven organizations were compromised by exploiting this zero-day. The researchers pointed out that a few hundred vulnerable servers exposed to the Internet are at risk. The CVE-2025-30406 flaw in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox stems from hardcoded keys in web.config files, enabling ViewState deserialization attacks. If unpatched, this allows remote code execution and full server compromise. Both root and portal configs must be secured to prevent exploitation. \u201cThis weakness can be leveraged to abuse the ASPX ViewState, a mechanism used to preserve the state of a web page and its controls between multiple HTTP requests. The hardcoded keys open the door for a very standard and well-researched attack technique with ViewState deserialization.\u201d reads the report published by cybersecurity firm Huntress. \u201cIf a Gladinet CentreStack or Triofox server is exposed to the Internet with these hardcoded keys, it is in immediate danger and needs to be patched or have the machineKey values changed as soon as possible . CVE-2025-30406 is known to be actively exploited by threat actors, and this 9.0 critical severity issue has no \u201cprerequisites\u201d other than knowing the default key values.\u201d Exploiting CVE-2025-30406 allows remote code execution as IISAPPPOOL\\portaluser, with easy privilege escalation to SYSTEM. Huntress demonstrated the risk with a working proof-of-concept exploit targeting Triofox web.config files. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any intentions of sharing the proof-of-concept to embolden other adversaries, but once an external exploit is shared publicly we will update this blog to include the technical details of recreating the attack script.\u201d continues the report. \u201cWe can confirm the Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox patches are effective in stopping exploitation from our tested proof-of-concept.\u201d In one attack, Huntress spotted an encoded PowerShell command used to download and run a DLL, the experts noticed that the technique was also seen in recent CrushFTP vulnerability exploits. The researchers observed the threat actors using lateral movement to install MeshCentral remote access tools. On the second host, attackers executed Impacket commands, MeshAgent, and Centre.exe. Huntress found approximately 120 endpoints running vulnerable Gladinet CentreStack software and is urging partners to patch CVE-2025-30406. The company released detection tools and Sigma rules. Gradient addressed the flaw and confirmed that the issue is actively exploited.

Read Time: 4 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Himachal Day is celebrated on April 15 every year. April 15 marks Himachal Day, commemorating the establishment of Himachal Pradesh as a state in 1948. This formation involved the merger of 30 princely states, including Chamba, Mandi, Sirmaur and Mahlog, into the Indian Union. Over the years, the state has evolved into a model of hill development, overcoming geographical and economic challenges. Initially governed as a centrally administered territory, Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory in 1950. It later achieved full statehood on January 25, 1971, becoming the 18th state of India. While January 25 is celebrated as Statehood Day, April 15 - Himachal Day - commemorates the beginning of the political and administrative unification of the region. Why April 15 Matters April 15, 1948, marked the formal creation of the province when the Indian government brought together the princely states under one administrative unit. Small hill princely states like Chamba, Sirmaur etc were merged after India's independence, laying the foundation of the modern Himachal Pradesh. This administrative step also brought these hilly regions under a common governance structure, leading to coordinated development and better infrastructure. Over the decades, Himachal Pradesh has transformed from a largely rural, agrarian area to one of India's most literate and environmentally conscious states. The Day's Significance The day is marked with official functions, parades and cultural performances across districts. People of the state use the occasion to reflect on the state's journey and reaffirm commitments to its continued growth and sustainability. This year, the state-level celebrations for the 78th 'Himachal Day' are being held at Killar, the headquarters of the remote Pangi Valley in Chamba district. This is the first time that Himachal formation day celebrations are taking place in Pangi Valley and highlights the state government's commitment to focus on the development and welfare of the remote areas. Himachal Day Wishes Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading the country in congratulating people of Himachal Pradesh on this day. \"Best wishes to all the people of the state on Himachal Day. My brothers and sisters of this state, renowned for its glorious culture, are known for their hard work, talent and valour. I wish that this special occasion brings happiness, prosperity and health in the lives of all of you, and also leads our Devbhoomi on the path of progress,\" he said in a post on X. \"Heartiest greetings of Himachal Day to the dear people of the state. Your affection, support and trust are our biggest strength in this journey of overall development of Himachal Pradesh. It is because of your participation that the state is rapidly moving towards self-reliance and prosperity. Our government's schemes for public welfare are reaching every person and bringing positive changes in their lives. On this occasion of Himachal Day, we all together will further strengthen our resolve to establish the state as a strong and self-reliant state,\" Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu posted on X. \"Himachal Day is more than just a date; it symbolises the unification of numerous small princely states into a cohesive, culturally rich, and administratively organised region nestled in the Himalayas. On this day, we celebrate Himachal Pradesh's unique heritage, vibrant culture, and remarkable progress. Despite challenging terrains and limited resources, the state has ascended to become one of India's most serene, beautiful, and progressive regions,\" tweeted Anirudh Singh, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayati Rai, Himachal Pradesh. 5 Tourist Destinations To Explore In Himachal Pradesh Shimla: Once the summer capital of British India, Shimla continues to draw visitors with its old-world architecture, bustling Mall Road, and scenic views.

The 13T has a smaller form factor with a 6.3-inch display, a massive 6200mAh battery, and 80W charging to rival the likes of the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9 Pro. It could also be the first OnePlus phone to feature a customizable button replacing the alert slider. The handset is rumored to debut in China sometime in April. It\u2019s almost time for a mid-cycle OnePlus flagship to pop out in the open. The OnePlus 13T has leaked a bunch of times already, and it\u2019s shaping up to be unlike any other phone from the OnePlus 13 family. Its design seems to be inspired by pretty much every other Android flagship mashed together. And now, the OnePlus 13T is said to feature a camera island inspired not by the OnePlus 13, but by the Pixel 9 Pro Fold . Related I tested 25 phones last year, and I love the OnePlus 13R for 5 reasons Can anyone say value? Posts 3 Over the years, OnePlus phones have carved out a distinct design identity, especially with their circular camera islands. The OnePlus Open had a centered circular camera bump, while the OnePlus 12 and 13 opted for a slightly off-centered one \u2014 but still circular all the same. This new leak, though, suggests the 13T is going a bit off-script (via Android Authority ). In an X (formerly Twitter) post by Tech Info (included below), you can see someone spinning what looks like a OnePlus 13T, showing how easily it spins on the tip of a finger, granted you\u2019ve got the skills for that. More interesting, though, is what the photos and video reveal: a rear design that includes a camera bump clearly inspired by the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Just like Google\u2019s foldable, the OnePlus 13T appears to have a metal camera bump with two vertically stacked lenses, an LED flash, and another sensor (likely not a third camera). While it resembles the Pixel 9 Pro Fold at a glance, OnePlus\u2019 sister brands \u2014 Oppo and Realme \u2014 also have a bunch of mid-tier and premium phones featuring similar squarish camera bumps. So, it\u2019s entirely possible the 13T is borrowing design cues from its cousins, with the Pixel being a secondary influence, if at all. The new leak aligns with an earlier one too , adding more credibility to the idea that this is indeed the final design. The OnePlus 13T could be a small-phone champ The OnePlus 13 and 13R are both fairly large phones. The 13T breaks away from that trend with its more compact 6.3-inch 120Hz display and flat iPhone-style edges. While compact phones have historically struggled with battery life, OnePlus is looking to challenge that narrative. The 13T is rumored to pack a massive 6200mAh battery \u2014 impressive, given its size. That\u2019s a near-perfect recipe to take on compact rivals like the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9 Pro . Close It doesn\u2019t stop there. The phone is also said to support super-fast 80W charging and will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. And in a major shift, the OnePlus 13T might be the first OnePlus phone to replace the iconic alert slider with a customizable button \u2014 yep, another move seemingly inspired by Apple. We don\u2019t have a confirmed launch date yet, but the OnePlus 13T is expected to go official in China sometime this month, with a global rollout likely soon after.

The company topped the charts for the very first time during the first quarter, capturing 19 percent of the global market, and we believe that the recently launched iPhone 16e has a lot to do with it. While the iPhone 16e is one of the major reasons, the company also introduced Apple Intelligence last year, which could also be another reason why the company secured the number one position. iPhone 16e aids Apple in taking the top spot in global smartphone shipments Despite economic uncertainties, Apple greatly benefited from the iPhone 16e launch, especially in emerging markets. Apple launched the iPhone 16e last month, which means that the demand for the device will continue to rule in the next quarter. The iPhone 16e comes with all the software features that the 'Pro' models brag, and considering the device's $599 price tag, it is a pretty good deal. It replaced the SE lineup and is the perfect device that will give you access to all the Apple Intelligence features. Related Story Apple\u2019s Foldable iPhone Will Have An Under-Screen Camera, But Will Not House All The TrueDepth Components Necessary For Enabling Face ID, Claims Tipster Samsung took the second spot this year with a market share of 18 percent, continuing its fall from 21 percent in Q1 2023. The South Korean tech giant started slow this year, possibly due to the late launch of the new Galaxy S25 lineup, but gradually improved its numbers by March. Xiaomi took the third spot with a 14 percent market share, which is an improvement over the 13 percent share during the same time the previous year. Xiaomi is quite popular in the Chinese market, and it has benefited from the expansion of its division into other emerging markets as well. Vivo and Oppo took the fourth and fifth positions, respectively, as the companies also operate in the same market as Xiaomi and benefited greatly from domestic demand. While the market grew by 3 percent in the first quarter of this year, Counterpoint Research predicts a slight decline for the rest of the year. The United States government has also introduced hefty tariffs on imports from China, India, Vietnam, and other regions, which could increase smartphone prices in the region. This could ultimately lead to reduced demand, thus hurting global sales. It remains to be seen where the tariffs lead the industry in the long run, but so far, the market does not favor a price shift.

It ambitiously combined an accessory mount and waterproof handlebar roll into one clean package. There are many details to unpack, then repack, then unpack again, so goes bikepacking. Read on for Spencer and Austin\u2019s thoughts on the sharp end of bikepacking bag innovation below\u2026 Holy wow, there are so many details to unpack with Tailfin\u2019s Bar Bag System. Combining a waterproof bar roll, accessory mount, and external storage all into one sleek package is an impressive feat. This is going to be a journey through options and configurations with plenty of side quests exploring the many details of this system, so buckle up. The Bar Bag System is available in two flavors: flat bar and drop bar. The drop bar system has a unique and innovative closure system to maximize space between the drops. I don\u2019t do much riding on drop bar bikes, and I find the closure system, though innovative, raises a red flag for me over its possibility of failure. So this review is going to focus on the flat bar flavor of the Tailfin Bar Bag System and my thoughts will carry over to the drop bar system with the exclusion of the closure mechanism. Tailfin Flat Bar Bag System Quick Hits Two Sizes: Small 5.8 to 14.7 L(+2.7 L pocket) Large 8.7 to 18.9 L (+3.5 L pocket) Fabric: 210D Hypalon and 210D Diamond Ripstop Weight: Clamp: 181 g Small: 604 g Large: 679 g 100% waterproof (purge valve for packing) X-Clamp mount Bar Clamp allows for accessories to be mounted Price: $315 (small) $330 (large) The Clamp Let\u2019s start where the bag meets your bike. Tailfin\u2019s hinged bar clamp attaches on either side of the stem and is native to 35 mm bars with shims down to 31.8 mm. If you need something smaller than that, you\u2019ll have to be crafty. From the clamp, we move toward the mounting/accessory bar \u2013 this bar and the accompanying mount \u201cstop\u201d are fully adjustable for whatever angle or Ergostem cosplay you might need. I\u2019m no fan of T25 bolts in places where I may want a ball head Allen if things get tight, but I had no issue during my review period. Importantly, the mount and accompanying crossbar space the bag off of your bars, keeping it clear of your housing and hoses. Gone are the days of foam spacers to keep everything from getting squished. There are a variety of accessories that can be mounted to this bar. Tailfin offers mounts for GoPro standard, Garmin, and Wahoo cycling computers, and an additional piece of 22.2 mm bar for anything else. Each end of the crossbar has a threaded end to mount these attachments, or a few can be mounted in the middle of the bar via a hinged clamp. Experienced bikepackers know how precious bar space is for accessory mounting, and the Tailfin system moves those accessories from your handlebars, above your bag, in one convenient and adjustable space. The Tailfin system incorporates all the utility of something like a Bar Yak system seamlessly into their handlebar system. The Bag Moving from the clamp to the main bag, we notice the Tailfin X-Clamp, a locking lever that clamps around the crossbar of the clamp and rests on a secondary hook that is also adjustable. The X-Clamp is mounted to an aluminum inner structure that gives the bag some shape and rigidity. Imagine a slimmed-down version of the Salsa Anything Cradle . One detail that sticks out to me on the Tailfin bag is the stretchy pockets. While the front pockets are a no-brainer for extra storage, I love the small stretchy pocket on the bottom of the bag. This was a feature I first noticed on early Pa\u2019lante backpacks, though its origin might lie elsewhere. This lower pocket was a perfect spot for my ground tarp or extra layers as I shed them throughout a ride. The front pockets offer a few spaces for organization and a surprising amount of volume when needed. Tailfin claims 3.5 L of extra space and I never got near that full capacity. Since all the exterior pockets are mesh, these are great places to dry wet gear or clothing. The dual-entry dry bag holds a whopping 19 L when rolled down appropriately. This allowed for plenty of space for a majority of my gear. This style of dry bag is tried and true and works just as expected on Tailfin\u2019s version of a classic. On the Trail As anyone who has ridden with a handlebar roll can tell you, they only work as well as you pack them. While the Tailfin system leans on the bar clamp and internal structure of the bag to reduce the need for careful stuffing, some attention to tensioning the roll closures of the bags is still necessary. When packed and rolled with care, the bag does not sag or flop around while on the trail. I found the clamp and its accompanying parts to work flawlessly. Once I had the angles and bag orientation set, I never had an issue with the clamp or bag slipping from its position. The clamp and mounting bar offer a wide range of adjustability depending on the use. On my touring bike, I had the bag slung low and close to my head tube, but on my full suspension, I was able to keep the bag high away from my tire due to the suspension. In each situation, the bag was secure. I loved being able to stash layers and snacks in the stretchy pockets during the day without having to open the main dry bag to access my stuff. Having even a small amount of organization is welcome on what is typically just a single large stuff sack. The stretch pockets, while not weatherproof, provided plenty of extra storage and organization for much-needed items during a long day of bikepacking. What I Liked The Tailfin Handlebar bag system is just that, a complete system; bag, bar mount, and accessories all in one clean package. Tailfin has distilled many ideas from across the bikepacking world, and that system works really well. The bag held its shape well when packed and was never floppy or saggy on the trail. The stretch mesh pockets are a great feature for expanded storage and quick access while preserving the waterproof nature of the main dry bag. I was impressed by just how much I could fit in the bag and then additionally stash in the mesh pockets. What I Did Not Like While the bag only incorporates one zipper that I could complain about, my next biggest fear is just how complex the whole bag is. I quick count reveals about 30 parts, including all the hardware on the handlebar bag system. While I had no issue with my system during the review, many of these small parts are potential points of failure, and the sheer number and specificity of those parts give me pause. The fabric on the non-drive side of the roll has started to abrade, creating a few small holes. With waterproof fabrics, there is always the consideration of weight vs durability, and I feel like Tailfin has balanced the two as well as can be expected. This abrasion is due to my laying the bike down, and the desert is a rough place for any fabric. This is going to be granular, but when the tension strap on the front mesh pockets is pulled and locked fully closed it is almost impossible to unstrap. This led me to always leave a bit of a looped \u201ctail\u201d so I had something to grab when it was released. I think the sizing of this strap could probably use a second look. Rolling Up The Tailfin Handlebar Bag System is as intricate as it is impressive. While the amount of hardware gives me pause, the adjustability and stability afforded by all the engineering is notable. If you value an all-in-one solution for your handlebar bag system, the Tailfin may be for you. The price is steep, but there are a lot of storage and accessory solutions wrapped into the system. If you are a smaller rider and bag clearance is minimal, the security and adjustability of the Tailfin system will be rather appealing. Being 6\u2019 tall, I rarely have to consider this, but even on my full-suspension bike, I needed to keep the bag as high as possible to avoid my tire. If your setup requires very specific clearances, then the Tailfin system may be for you. Austin Killips\u2019 Take The Tailfin handlebar bag, like other fancy gizmos and doodads on my bike that I want to call useless but can\u2019t because I secretly cling dear to them, is an object that generates intrigue from passersby. It\u2019s pouring rain, and the off-duty lifty at the top of the mountain wants to know how waterproof the bag is. My housemate wants to know if the pockets are actually that helpful. My dear friend and host gives it a curious, cursory look-over upon its arrival in the mail. The Bar Bag System does little to refute his belief that Tailfin is the Apple of the bikepacking world. While integrating the functionality of a handlebar accessory mount is a nice innovation that I was excited to utilize, I couldn\u2019t help but ask, Why do I need or want this object? Is the amount of time that could be saved by the admittedly nifty mounting lever enough to justify the consequences of something going awry? Despite weeks spent thrashing the bag and mount on technical descents during training rides through the Elk Mountains with no issue, I still opted out of using it for my failed Colorado Trail run. The utility calculus was simple and speaks to the exact concerns that Spencer outlined. If this thing breaks somewhere remote, I am fucked. While I passed on the mounting system, I do sincerely believe the Tailfin bag itself is a good object and I was excited to affix the bag to my harness mount. Even with the full functionality of the various pockets being limited by the straps and the weight penalty of the mounting hardware plate, it still offers enough quality of life improvements to be worthwhile. The air release is a welcome addition. The abundance of pockets allows for an even more considered curation of snack zones. And I\u2019m confident in the waterproofing after spending my afternoons being pelted by the mid-afternoon showers that always dot the late summer blotter in Colorado\u2019s high country. The Tailfin Bar Bag System just feels like an over-engineered solution to the admittedly annoying problem of handlebar bags that flop about on descents and washboard roads. Maybe my fears are unfounded, but materials like fabric and foam don\u2019t hide secrets like metal can. Fraying threads and compressed foam help me make informed decisions about how careless I want to be in continuing to use an object. Aluminum doesn\u2019t share these secrets with me, It simply absorbs force until the day comes when it cannot bear the weight of our over-packed bags. Pros The handlebar mount is solid and unwavering Mesh expandable storage is convenient and sizeable Combines accessory mounts into a bar mount for a clean cockpit with plenty of options Two sizes and bar style options Lots of adjustability Material choices balance weight and durability nicely Cons Expensive Heavy Many small parts create possible points of failure Clamping any handlebars smaller than 31.8 mm is complicated Close Lightbox Expand", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "http://theradavist.com/tailfin-bar-bag-system-long-term-review/", "source": "Theradavist.com", "published_at": "2025-04-14T15:38:10"}, {"id": 1133, "title": "Amazon - Charmast Portable Charger with Built-in Cables & Wall Plug $24.99", "content": "29% Off Charmast Portable Charger with Built-in Cables & Wall Plug Skip to Content When you buy through our links we may earn a commission.

FTC claims that in acquiring the two platforms, Meta aimed to eliminate competitors Thomson Reuters \u00b7 Posted: Apr 14, 2025 11:35 AM EDT | Last Updated: April 14 A woman holds a smartphone with the Facebook logo in front of a display of the Meta logo. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission argues Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago make it an illegal monopoly in the social media industry. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) Social Sharing Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta Platforms, took the stand on Monday at a high-stakes trial in Washington over claims by U.S. antitrust enforcers that the company spent billions of dollars to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to fend off Facebook competitors. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argues that the Meta acquisitions from more than a decade ago were done to eliminate competitors who could threaten Facebook's status as the go-to social media platform for users to connect with friends and family. If the commission's claim is upheld, Meta could be forced to hive off Instagram and WhatsApp from its operations. Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Zuckerberg calmly responded to questions while working to combat allegations about Meta's motive in buying the companies. Zuckerberg emphasized that friends and family sharing was only one priority for the app along with discovering other content. In fact, a 2018 decision to prioritize Facebook content shared by users' friends over video posts and other public content failed to grasp a shift toward users sharing that content via messages instead of posting life updates in their feeds, Zuckerberg said. \"I think we misunderstood how social engagement online was evolving,\" Zuckerberg said. \"People just kept on engaging with more and more stuff that wasn't what their friends were doing,\" he said. The case poses an existential threat to Meta, which by some estimates earns about half of its U.S. advertising revenue from Instagram. It also gives the public its first real measure of how strongly the new Trump administration will follow up on its promises to take on Big Tech. WATCH | How much money has Big Tech given to Donald Trump? How much money has Big Tech given to Donald Trump? | About That 3 months ago Duration 13:48 U.S. President Donald Trump raised a record amount of corporate donations for his inauguration, millions of which were donated by CEOs of major tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta. Andrew Chang explains the shift in Trump's relationships with these industry leaders since his first term, and the symbolism of their proximity to the president. Images provided by Getty Images, Reuters and The Canadian Press. Competition with TikTok The FTC has pointed to emails in which Zuckerberg proposed acquiring the photo-sharing Instagram app as a way to neutralize a potential Facebook competitor, and expressed worry that encrypted messaging service WhatsApp could grow into a social network. Meta has argued that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg's past statements are no longer relevant amid fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube and Apple's messaging app. How users spend time on social media \u2014 and whether they consider the services interchangeable \u2014 will be core to the case. Meta will point to an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook during TikTok's brief shutdown in the United States in January as evidence of competition. The FTC claims Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share with friends and family. Its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny, privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event on Sept. 25, 2024. Zuckerberg testified on Monday in the first day of the antitrust trial. (Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters) Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that while the FTC has enough evidence to move forward, the agency \"faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial.\" The trial could stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to separately prove that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition. Instagram especially valuable to Meta Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line. While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate $37.13 billion this year, a little over half of Meta's U.S. ad revenue. Instagram also generates more revenue per user than any other social platform, including Facebook, according to Emarketer. The Instagram logo is seen on a cell phone in Boston, Oct. 14, 2022. The fact that Meta could be forced to sell Instagram as a result of these antitrust proceedings poses a big threat to the company. (Michael Dwyer/The Associated Press) WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue, but it is the company's biggest app in terms of daily users, and is ramping up efforts to earn money off tools like chatbots. Zuckerberg has said such \"business messaging\" services are likely to drive the company's next wave of growth. The case is one of five where the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice accuse Big Tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies. Amazon and Apple are both being sued, and Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a trial is set to begin next week on the government's bid to force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Trump vs. big tech The case is part of a crackdown on Big Tech started during Trump's first administration. Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Zuckerberg has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. LISTEN | CBC's Front Burner discusses antitrust cases against Google: Front Burner 24:43 The case against Google The second of two major antitrust cases against Google wrapped up this week. Earlier this year, a judge found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the internet search market. Now the U.S. Department of Justice is arguing the same thing about its grip on online advertising. This is all part of a major push of antitrust litigation against tech companies by the U.S. government \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Meta are all facing similar cases. What's behind this push to crack down on these companies now? Would proposed remedies like breaking them up actually make a difference? And will the momentum survive the transition to a second Trump presidency? Paris Marx \u2014 author of the tech newsletter Disconnect and host of the podcast Tech Won't Save Us \u2014 breaks it all down. For transcripts of Front Burner, please visit: https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/transcripts [https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/transcripts] Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google also face antitrust lawsuits by U.S. enforcers. Several major tech companies have moved to align with Trump since the election, such as by rolling back diversity initiatives and having executives engage directly with the White House. While a shift from the combative tone the companies took during Trump's first term, it has not resulted in a pullback on the antitrust cases.

Kennedy Jr. promises to uncover what he says is \"the autism epidemic\" by the fall. Scientists say that's unlikely. Erik Carter for NBC News / Getty Images By Brandy Zadrozny SAN DIEGO \u2014 The attendees of the second-annual Autism Health Summit had already sat through hours of presentations about treatments that promise miracles to help heal the condition \u2014 water filters and electromagnetic gadgets, supplements, stem cell treatments only available in Europe, and fecal transplants here in the U.S. Of all the speakers at the conference, the one who got the biggest round of applause wasn\u2019t even in the room. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former fixture at this kind of gathering, addressed the audience in a short, prerecorded video \u2014 not as the anti-vaccine lawyer and activist as he had so many times before, but as a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, the secretary of health and human Services. And from that seat of power, Kennedy affirmed he was still their man, praising summit organizers Tracey and Steve Slepcevic as \u201cdear friends\u201d who had \u201cgiven their lives in service to the autistic and their families.\" \u201cYour issue is no longer on the fringe,\u201d he said, finishing with a promise of a future \u201cwhere autism is once again, very rare, where families with autism are well supported, where people on the spectrum are valued for the unique gifts they have to offer in our society.\u201d These types of gatherings are on the rise. While they may advertise different themes, there\u2019s a shared belief system among them: a rejection of mainstream science, skepticism about the government and loud complaints that the powerful are hiding something from the everyday American. With Kennedy now in Washington, and the president himself suggesting there\u2019s merit to those claims, the gatherings are becoming less fringe and more politically relevant. Video of Kennedy's promise on autism was played in multiple sessions. Brandy Zadrozny / NBC News The conference room at the Town and Country hotel was already abuzz with Kennedy\u2019s latest bombshell. While rattling off his department\u2019s early endeavors at a televised Cabinet meeting last week \u2014 they included getting \u201cbad chemicals\u201d out of food and \u201cgood food\u201d into school lunches \u2014 he stated plainly that he would, in five months, discover the cause of autism. \u201cBy September,\u201d he had said to the president, \u201cwe will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we\u2019ll be able to eliminate those exposures.\u201d \u201cThat would be so big,\u201d Trump replied. And it would \u2014 if it weren\u2019t so unlikely . Kennedy later told Fox News that National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya had only just begun soliciting proposals from scientists around the world, and HHS hasn\u2019t said more about the timeline. Even if they handed out grants immediately, it would give them barely more than a season to solve a puzzle that has preoccupied researchers for over 80 years. Since Austrian-American psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner first gave it a name in 1943 , doctors, scientists, parents, and people with autism have sought answers to the complex set of conditions that vary widely in presentation and severity. About 1 out of 36 children has been identified as having an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research points to genetics as the primary factor, likely in combination with certain environmental and developmental influences that scientists are still researching. But the extensively studied and disproven theory that vaccines are to blame for autism has been embraced by parents and groups like those at the summit. The condition generally emerges during childhood, around when routine immunizations are administered. To this group, it\u2019s no coincidence. Science isn\u2019t built to prove a universal negative. Every variable cannot be tested in every circumstance across all time. So it is that despite large, peer-reviewed studies in the U.S., Japan, Denmark, and elsewhere showing no causal link between vaccines and autism, it\u2019s never been proven to the satisfaction of the anti-vaccine community. The question has also been litigated , and claims have fallen short against the overwhelming evidence presented by doctors and scientists. Still, because there\u2019s always a sliver of possibility \u2014 however remote \u2014 that something could be true somewhere, somehow, the theory persists. Before his autism announcement, Kennedy\u2019s short tenure as HHS secretary had already stirred condemnation among public health experts who said that his anti-vaccine views undermined trust in science. Author James Terence Fisher, who has an autistic son, said in an op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Kennedy\u2019s rise to power had \u201cre-traumatized\u201d many autism families and warned that the administration could make people like his son \u201cguinea pigs for experiments and treatments based on conspiratorial and money-making theories that have frequently led to abusive and ineffective treatments.\u201d It\u2019s happened before, he wrote. Andrew Wakefield, the British former physician whose retracted 1998 study in The Lancet helped launch the modern anti-vaccine movement, used \u201cinvasive and demeaning techniques,\u201d Fischer wrote, adding that Wakefield had paid children at his own child\u2019s birthday party for blood samples. Kennedy's faithful bristled when he recently recommended that children in Texas get vaccinated to protect against measles, after an outbreak there sickened hundreds and killed at least two. To them, the guidance was a betrayal of a movement he helped create. But with Kennedy's promise to root out and eliminate by this fall the specific environmental causes of autism \u2014 whether in food, water or, as Trump suggested at the Cabinet meeting, \u201cthe shots\u201d\u2014 Kennedy offered a return to the foundational myth of the modern anti-vaccine movement. The crowd at the Autism Health Summit heard him loud and clear, and now they were on their feet. The three-day summit didn\u2019t have an option for press coverage on its website, so I paid the $395 for a ticket using my name and work email. I wore my name badge and introduced myself as a journalist, handing out my business card to everyone I spoke with. Photos and videos were permitted, and the event was livestreamed to remote attendees. Advertised as a \u201cjourney to wellness,\u201d the Autism Health Summit was one of several anti-vaccine-adjacent events to take place in recent weeks. The Summit for Truth & Wellness was held at the end of March in Rochester, New York. Drs. Pierre Kory and Mary Talley Bowden, both known for prescribing Ivermectin for Covid-19 and long Covid despite a lack of evidence, shared a stage with the writer and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf and Mary Holland, president of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once chaired. Earlier this month, a hotel in Atlanta hosted Honest Medicine: Redefining Health, a conference organized by the Independent Medical Alliance \u2014 formerly the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group whose doctors prescribe anti-viral medications that go against medical consensus. Some of their doctors have been disciplined by medical boards for spreading misinformation. There used to be just one such marquee gathering. AutismOne, held annually by a nonprofit of the same name in a Chicago hotel near the airport, was the flagship convention for self-described Autism Moms and Dads. But with the growth of other anti-vaccine groups that thrived during the pandemic \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s own Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 and the ease of online organizing, AutismOne\u2019s funding dried up. It quietly dissolved in January. Into that void stepped Tracy Slepcevic, an Air Force veteran and author of the book \"Warrior Mom\" (not to be confused with former anti-vaccine spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy\u2019s \"Mother Warriors\"). Slepcevic supported Kennedy\u2019s failed run for president in 2024 and registered Autism Health Inc. as a nonprofit last year. She currently coaches other parents on how to \u201cheal\u201d their autistic kids. She said she tried hyperbaric oxygen, special diets, stem cell therapy and \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d to \u201cheal\u201d her now-adult son\u2019s autism, which she believes was caused by vaccines. Slepcevic told the crowd that she spent all the money she had, even short-selling her house to pay for the treatments. \u201cIf anyone says, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019 I\u2019m not going to feel sorry for you,\u201d Slepcevic said from the stage. After a song performed by movement stalwarts Geoff and Simone Sewell, Slepcevic called up a couple to the stage \u2014 her new clients, she explained. The father told the crowd that after just two weeks of following Slepcevic\u2019s advice restricting dairy and cutting out apple juice, their 6-year-old son had seemed to improve. He spoke of how they had been lost and hopeless and sad. They were depressed, just like many in the crowd, he suspected. But now, they were optimistic. They were going to do whatever it takes, he said. They were going to be warrior parents. Outside the ballroom were the vendors, about 50 tables packed together, all offering the same message: healing was possible \u2014 for a price. Each table pushed a product or service promising some pathway to wellness. There were water filters \u2014 one to detoxify, another to \u201calkalize\u201d\u2014 and a nearly $6,000 electromagnetic gadget that claimed to improve circulation. Contraptions emitted infrared light or pulsed electromagnetic fields. Supplement kits promised to flush out mold, heavy metals and microplastics. Vibrating plates were pitched as neurological reset tools. And there were countless devices \u2014 necklaces, patches, laptop shields, pet collars and full-body blankets \u2014 meant to block 5G, electromagnetic fields and radiation, including the Wi-Fi all around us. Alongside the gadgets were services, too \u2014 nutritionists offering on-the-spot consultations, sessions in a hyperbaric chamber and one vendor advertising something described as a \u201cblood oil change.\u201d Vendors packed into the Autism Health Summit in San Diego. Brandy Zadrozny / NBC News One mom attending with her husband was still taking it all in. It was their first autism conference, suggested by a chiropractor who was treating their 14-year-old autistic son three times a week. \u201cSome of this is easy to understand. Other stuff? I\u2019m like, \u2018What are they talking about?\u2019\u201d said the 40-year-old woman from Escondido, California, who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity to protect her son's privacy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of technical terms, medical terms, brain diagrams. I\u2019m like, \u2018Just tell me what I need.\u2019\u201d Other parents were more practiced. A woman in her 60s from Laguna Beach told me she had healed her daughter in the 2000s with trips to Greece for stem cell transplants. She\u2019d come to the summit to learn whether anything new was out there; her daughter was feeling better from an all-carnivore diet but still had bad days. (Scientific evidence is lacking to support the theory that an all-meat diet benefits people with autism.) There were roughly two dozen sessions over two days. Some were meant as inspiration, to show parents what was possible. Among the first speakers was Collin Carley, a 28-year-old in a neat black suit who spoke about his journey from a toddler diagnosed with autism who threw tantrums, obsessed over trains and insisted on blowing on every dandelion. Carley recounted years of intensive therapies, with \u201cone biomedical plan after the other.\u201d He got IV infusions and chelation treatments, where pills, sprays or injections are used to \u201cget the metals out\u201d of the body. He described a childhood stripped of normalcy, a \u201c40-hour workweek\u201d of treatments and regimens. He said it had worked. He now swims and surfs, holds a blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu, and has worked jobs from deckhand to pizza delivery driver. Women in the audience whispered to each other, \u201cWow.\u201d But it\u2019s also the kind of life enjoyed by many on the autism spectrum who never received the biomedical interventions that Carley did. The first day\u2019s headliner was Peter McCullough, a cardiologist who now works for a supplement and telehealth company selling alternative treatments and vaccine \u201cdetoxes.\" He ran through a list of risk factors he said warranted further study: gene mutations, premature birth, parental age, immune system dysfunction and vaccine reactions. He also talked strategy, offering a language shift in the anti-vaccine community, away from suggesting that vaccines \u201ccause\u201d autism. It would be more palatable to the masses, he argued, if everyone started saying vaccines were a \u201crisk factor\u201d for autism. He defended Wakefield, comparing him to Ignaz Semmelweis, the 19th-century Hungarian doctor who was institutionalized after suggesting handwashing could prevent infection. And McCullough dared to cast doubt on Kennedy\u2019s ability to deliver on his promise by September. \u201cIt\u2019s too short of a time to actually do any research study,\u201d he said. The crowd groaned. I sat near the front of the room to hear the final speaker, anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree, former communications director for Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign and CEO of the movement\u2019s newest offshoot, Make America Healthy Again \u2014 MAHA, which Bigtree has turned into a nonprofit, a super PAC and an LLC (a limited liability company). Two women at the table asked me if I had an autistic child. I said that I did, but that wasn\u2019t why I was there and gave them my business card. They told me about their children. One woman, with white hair and a bedazzled \u201cKennedy for President\u201d water bottle, spoke about her 26-year-old son who loved swimming and needed round-the-clock care. The pandemic and California\u2019s \u201ctyrannical\u201d lockdowns, she said, had been devastating \u2014 interrupting his routines, closing beaches and cutting off his services. Another described her now-adult son\u2019s febrile seizures , which she said had started just days after a diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis shot and landed him in the children\u2019s hospital. When the women politely but pointedly asked what I thought about it all, I paused for a minute to think. The conference seemed designed to prey on the fear of autism and the love we all feel for our kids. I told them I hadn\u2019t seen convincing evidence presented during the summit that would shake my belief in the mainstream science around autism. Del Bigtree, CEO of the anti-vaccine group Informed Consent Action Network, begged the crowd, \"Please don\u2019t keep asking [Kennedy] to turn over his cards.\" Brandy Zadrozny / NBC News Bigtree, meanwhile, was going way past his allotted time to the crowd\u2019s delight, recounting his long career in anti-vaccine activism and his intersection with Kennedy\u2019s. He described watching Kennedy's swearing-in from the Oval Office, where he\u2019d been invited as one of a handful of close advisers. While Bigtree played the clip of Kennedy\u2019s September promise \u2014 the third time I\u2019d heard it that weekend \u2014 one of the two women I'd been chatting with stood up to leave, touched me on the shoulder and handed me a handwritten note: \u201cBrandy, I\u2019m glad I got to meet you. I respect people on all sides of the issue. I don\u2019t claim to have all the answers. Maybe there are multiple causes of autism. I hope your article goes well, and that you just consider, for a brief space in time\u2014what if there is a chance\u2014even a small chance\u2014that they are right?\u201d Bigtree, from the stage, continued, now with the flair of a revival preacher. \u201cIt\u2019ll be cataclysmic,\u201d he said of the answers he said Kennedy would deliver in September. \u201cFor some there will be gnashing of teeth, there\u2019ll be great fear and terror, there\u2019ll be concern, there\u2019ll be lack of trust, there\u2019ll be pain \u2014 but there will finally be truth.\u201d He wanted parents to know they had a hero fighting for them in Washington. \u201cRobert Kennedy Jr., who stood with you and hugged you and has been here with you this whole time, now has the most powerful position in health in the world,\u201d he told the room. \u201cGod \u2026 is \u2026 good.\u201d His speech signaled the end of the summit. The crowd shuffled out into the foyer for a reception. A snaking line formed for photos with Bigtree. The inventor of a sensory play tent for kids with autism danced alone to Journey\u2019s \u201cAny Way You Want It.\u201d People sipped cocktails from plastic cups and visited, talked and chased their kids around. Nobody seemed ready to go. Brandy Zadrozny Brandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, his attention has shifted almost entirely to one thing: augmented reality (AR) glasses. Insiders say this isn\u2019t just another project for Cook. It\u2019s the only thing on his plate. \u201cTim cares about nothing else,\u201d a source told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.\u201d AR glasses have now become Apple\u2019s top hardware priority. Cook wants to beat Meta and be the first to deliver a lightweight, all-day wearable device that overlays digital content directly onto the real world. Think of it as replacing your iPhone \u2014 but on your face. The stakes are high. Apple isn\u2019t just building a product. It\u2019s chasing a whole new platform. Gurman says Apple still needs to solve major hardware and usability challenges. That includes ultra-high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip, and a compact battery that can last for hours. There\u2019s also the question of software. Apple has to create applications that make AR glasses feel essential, not gimmicky. They\u2019ll need to match \u2014 or exceed \u2014 the usefulness of an iPhone. And they\u2019ll need to be affordable, even at scale. Despite the hurdles, Apple is all in. Billions have already gone into Vision Pro, and AR glasses are the next step \u2014 not a side project. The push comes at a moment when Apple is rethinking how it organizes product teams and reassigning leadership around Siri and Vision development. Apple Leads Global Smartphone Market in Q1 2025 While Cook is looking ahead, Apple\u2019s current business isn\u2019t slowing down. According to Counterpoint Research , Apple took the number one spot in global smartphone sales for Q1 2025 \u2014 a first for any first quarter. Apple captured 19% of the global market, just edging out Samsung at 18%. The iPhone 16e, launched in March at $599, played a key role in that success. It replaced the iPhone SE as the company\u2019s most affordable option and drove growth in emerging markets. Samsung slipped from 21% in Q1 2023, hampered by a delayed Galaxy S25 launch. Xiaomi took third place with 14%, followed by Vivo and OPPO. Notably, Apple\u2019s growth came from outside its core regions \u2014 the U.S., Europe, and China saw flat or declining numbers, but Apple posted double-digit gains in India, Japan, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Overall, the global market grew 3% year-over-year, but rising tariffs and economic uncertainty could still drag down full-year growth. Counterpoint has lowered its forecast accordingly. Still, that success doesn\u2019t seem to be where Tim Cook is placing his bets. While the iPhone remains Apple\u2019s core business today, it\u2019s clear that Cook is looking toward a future where AR glasses become the next iPhone-level product.

Numi Prasarn/Viva Tung/CNET Apple is developing two new models of its Vision Pro headset, according to a report: one that's expected to be lighter and more affordable than the original, and another designed to tether with Macs . Despite sluggish demand, the company remains focused on creating versions of the AR/VR headset with broader mainstream appeal, Bloomberg reported on Monday. The lower-cost Vision Pro will likely have a less powerful chip and scaled-back features, bringing the price down significantly from the original $3,500. It's also expected to include an ultralow-latency system for streaming a Mac display, according to the report. And in line with previous reports, Apple is also still working on its own smart glasses equipped with cameras and microphones, similar to Meta's Ray-Ban line . CEO Tim Cook \"cares about nothing else\" more than delivering a true pair of AR glasses, calling it a \"top priority,\" Bloomberg said, citing an anonymous Apple engineer. But until the technology can be perfected in a way that's comfortable and as wearable as traditional eyewear, Apple sees camera- and mic-enabled glasses as a stepping stone into the space. This builds on earlier reports that Apple intends to channel some of the Vision Pro's billion-dollar R&D investment in visual intelligence into future products, including smart glasses expected to launch in 2027. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent years, Apple has often focused on refining buzzy, existing technologies, from mixed-reality headsets to AI features. As it stands, Meta is better positioned to dominate the smart glasses category, particularly as it continues to enhance its hardware, software and growing ecosystem of services. But Cook, according to Bloomberg, is \"hell-bent on creating an industry-leading product before Meta can.\" The report said the glasses would use Siri and Visual Intelligence as part of Apple's broader Apple Intelligence AI platform . In keeping with Apple's overall product strategy, privacy would remain a central focus. Still, the company may face challenges in making the device as indispensable as its other products, particularly the iPhone -- and at a price that's accessible enough to drive mass adoption. Watch this: Apple's Big 'Vision' for Siri at WWDC25? The Future Could be Cameras 05:26 A long-term priority Eric Abbruzzese, research director at market research firm ABI Research, called Apple's interest in smart glasses a long-term priority. \"AR has simply proven more difficult than VR to go to market with devices that balance cost and capability,\" he said. \"AR as a supplement to the smartphone, similar to an Apple Watch, is a very compelling product category that is truthfully only just starting to be served appropriately.\" Glasses like Meta's Ray-Bans show that people are interested in smart eyewear but building ones with screens still presents a major challenge, Abbruzzese said. At the same time, AR and AI are increasingly intertwined, with companies like Apple, Meta and Google designing products that blend the two. Abbruzzese described the \"holy grail\" product as mass-market smart glasses -- an affordable, display-enabled wearable that pairs with a smartphone and uses sensors, voice input and AI agents for natural, hands-free interaction. \"The relationship between AR and AI is a significant, mutually beneficial relationship where each technology benefits from the other,\" he said.", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-reportedly-plans-new-vision-pro-models-prioritizes-meta-ray-ban-glasses-rival/", "source": "CNET", "published_at": "2025-04-14T15:34:00"}, {"id": 1139, "title": "Meta Faces Potential Breakup With Start of Antitrust Trial", "content": "Meta Faces Potential Breakup With Start of Antitrust Trial View Market Dashboard Meta Faces Potential Breakup With Start of Antitrust Trial The US Federal Trade Commission is finally having its day in court against Meta Platforms Inc., arguing that the company must be broken up for illegally monopolizing the social media market after buying Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. Bloomberg Published 14 Apr 2025, 09:02 PM IST Meta Faces Potential Breakup With Start of Antitrust Trial (Bloomberg) -- The US Federal Trade Commission is finally having its day in court against Meta Platforms Inc., arguing that the company must be broken up for illegally monopolizing the social media market after buying Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. The FTC\u2019s opening salvo began Monday in Washington before Chief Judge James Boasberg in a case that\u2019s been years in the making. Agency attorneys kicked off their arguments by invoking a long US tradition of seeking to ensure a competitive marketplace, one that the FTC\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Matheson, accused Meta of violating. \u201cFor more than 100 years, American public policy has insisted firms must compete if they want to succeed,\u201d Matheson said in his opening statement. \u201cThe reason we are here is that Meta broke the deal.\u201d If the FTC prevails, a spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp would undo years of integration between the apps, disrupt two of the most popular digital consumer products in the world and potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars in Meta\u2019s market value. It would also raise serious questions about how the government evaluates and approves deals. The company is poised to counter with its defense later Monday. The trial is expected to last about two months and feature testimony as soon as this week from Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and former executive Sheryl Sandberg. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson was in the courtroom for the trial\u2019s opening. Earlier Monday, while cautioning against over regulation, he told Fox Business \u201cthe antitrust laws can help make sure that no private sector company gets so powerful that it affects our lives in ways that are really bad for all Americans.\u201d A final decision will hinge on how social media is defined, and whether Meta dominates that market. The FTC will focus on how people communicate with friends and family \u2014 what it calls the \u201cpersonal social networking services\u201d market, which it claims is composed primarily of messages and media shared between close contacts. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp are \u201ckiller acquisitions\u201d that prevented those companies from competing. To support its case that Meta is a monopoly, the FTC will argue that the quality of its apps has declined, most noticeably with increased ads and weakened privacy protections. In 2010 \u201cMeta was faced with a sea change in competitive conditions,\u201d Matheson said, referring to the growing mobile market. \u201cThey decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them.\u201d Meta bought WhatsApp in part to fend off an offer from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google which was also considering buying the company, according to Matheson. And Meta also considered buying Snap Inc. for $6 billion in 2013, though the Snapchat owner turned the offer down. The number was not previously known, as reports at the time pegged the discussions as for half that much. Snap representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. In his opening argument, Matheson said the FTC will highlight \u201csmoking gun\u201d emails from Meta execs including Zuckerberg, particularly one from 2012 where he described the Instagram deal as a way to \u201cneutralize a competitor.\u201d After Meta bought Instagram it \u201cfundamentally manipulated the experience\u201d offered by the service, Matheson said, allowing it to avoid cannibalizing its own more profitable Facebook product. While that is a \u201crational business decision,\u201d Matheson said it \u201coffends the policy\u201d of the antitrust laws. Meta has pushed back aggressively against the FTC\u2019s claims, arguing that it competes intensely with a variety of platforms, including ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok, Snap\u2019s Snapchat, Google\u2019s YouTube, Apple Inc.\u2019s iMessage and Elon Musk\u2019s X. The agency says that only Snapchat competes with Meta, and that a number of other past competitors, including MySpace, are now defunct. The FTC may have a tough time in court. Although Boasberg denied Meta\u2019s motion to throw out the case in November, he said \u201cprevailing here, however, does not obscure the fact that the commission faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial.\u201d Meta also argues that the FTC had a chance to challenge the deals \u2014 for Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 \u2014 and permitted them to proceed. The FTC opened an investigation into Meta in 2019 during the first Trump administration and sued the company in December 2020. Former FTC Chair Lina Khan under the Biden administration advanced the case, which is now in the hands of Ferguson, who was named by President Donald Trump to head the agency in January. The case will test the government\u2019s ability to police competition in the fast-moving tech sector, which has evolved significantly. Since 2019, Musk purchased Twitter Inc., TikTok became one of the most dominant social media apps in the world, and Meta launched rival products to compete with both of them.

Esha Dey for Bloomberg News : \u200e On Friday, US Customs and Border Protection announced a tariff exclusion for some electronics, only for US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the president on Sunday to follow up by saying the reprieve was temporary and a procedural step in the longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. US stocks are coming out of an intensely volatile week, when the benchmark indexes swung wildly amid news on tariffs. The swing was most extreme after President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on the levies for most countries except China. Stocks soared on that, with the S&P 500 notching its best one-day gain in 17 years and capping its best week since 2023. The exemptions announced Friday night may be a boost for shares of companies from iPhone-maker Apple Inc. to semiconductor giant Nvidia Corp. Still, Lutnick and Trump\u2019s suggestions that they may only be temporary are likely to keep traders on their toes. \u200e MacDailyNews Note: President Trump remarked on Sunday via Truth Social about his latest tariff moves: NOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u201cbucket.\u201d The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! \u200e Please help support MacDailyNews \u2014 and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more \u2014 by subscribing to our Substack : macdailynews.substack.com .

Pros: Crystal clear 5K resolution Excellent color accuracy 12MP Center Stage camera Cons: Expensive Lacks HDR Height-adjustable stand costs extra Buy Now 04/15/2025 07:27 am GMT \u201c My dream setup 2025 \u201d comes to us from Redditor Svesolid of Sweden, who drives a phalanx of Apple displays new and old using an M4 Mac mini and a 14-inch M1 MacBook Pro. He runs a Studio Display and a pair of older Thunderbolt displays. Apple discontinued its Thunderbolt Display in mid 2016 . \u201c2025 is the year I finally got my dream setup,\u201d they said. \u201cI have owned a Thunderbolt Display for many years, bought a Studio Display a few years ago and now I bought a second-hand Thunderbolt Display.\u201d What else is in the setup? This: M1 iPad Air (5th generation), popular Logitech MX Master 3 wireless mouse and Logitech MX Keys wireless keyboard, excellent KEF LSX II speakers on KEF P1 Desk Pads, and Bower & Wilkins PX7 S2e over-ear noise-canceling headphones (which, at around $200 to $300 on sale, pass for affordable from that storied brand). \u201cAll this to be able to do what I like most, electronic music production and photo editing,\u201d they added. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Commenters seemed impressed and curious. Quality of Thunderbolt display versus Studio Display In this shot, you can see the woofer under the desk that goes with the KEF speakers. Photo: [email protected] \u201cHow do the two Thunderbolt Displays compare in quality when placed side by side with the Studio Display?\u201d asked a commenter. Svesolid acknowledged the big difference in resolution, but downplayed it. \u201cThere is a slight difference, of course it is visible that one is 5K and the other 2K, but that is not something I think about,\u201d Svesolid replied. \u201cThe color reproduction is just good on all of them. I am very satisfied!\u201d Thunderbolt Displays had 1440p resolution, or 2.5K. Given that users worry about effects like mouse cursor sticking and jumping, or even getting headaches from differences in screen resolution, from lesser differences \u2014 say, 1440p vs 1080p \u2014 the gap between 5K (5120 \u00d7 2880p) and 2.5K (2560 x 1440p) seems pretty extreme. But how much it bothers you probably comes down to how much you have to focus as you look from screen to screen. Focusing on the Studio Display and occasionally glancing at the Thunderbolt Displays might not be too bad. Shop these items now: Great color! 27-inch Apple Thunderbolt Cinema Display (Renewed) $564.75 This model of Apple's classic display features a glossy, LED-backlit screen with 2560x1440 pixel resolution, a built-in FaceTime HD camera and three USB 2.0 ports.

Apple AI To Use Your Personal Data 10 hours ago 10 Years of Apple Watch: Announces Global Close Your Rings Day on April 24 to Mark 13 hours ago Join the community The global smartphone market saw notable changes in Q1 2025, as Apple claimed the top spot for the first time in a first quarter, holding 19% of the sell-through share. This marks a steady position compared to Q1 2024 and Q1 2023, where Apple also maintained a 19% and 20% share, respectively. The launch of the iPhone 16e and growth in emerging markets like India and Japan contributed to this achievement. Samsung ranked second with an 18% share in Q1 2025, slightly down from 20% in Q1 2024 and 21% in Q1 2023. Despite this decline, Samsung\u2019s March sales showed double-digit growth following the release of its S25 series and new A-series devices. Xiaomi continued its upward trajectory, reaching a 14% share in Q1 2025, up from 13% in Q1 2024 and 12% in Q1 2023. The brand\u2019s expansion into premium segments and strong domestic performance were major contributors to its growth. Vivo gained momentum with an 8% share in Q1 2025, maintaining its position from Q1 2024 but improving from its 6% share in Q1 2023. Growth was driven by its presence in China and emerging markets. OPPO retained an 8% share in Q1 2025, unchanged from Q1 2024 but slightly down from its 10% share in Q1 2023. Despite this dip, OPPO saw sales growth in regions like India, Latin America, and Europe. The \u201cOthers\u201d category grew to represent a larger portion of the market at 33% in Q1 2025, compared to 32% in Q1 2024 and 29% in Q1 2023. This reflects increased competition from brands like HONOR, Huawei, and Motorola, which are gaining traction globally. More here . Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

More President Joe Biden speaks during a roundtable with American and Indian business leaders in the East Room of the White House on June 23, 2023 in Washington, DC. Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held the meeting to meet with a range of leaders from the tech and business worlds and to discuss topics including innovation and AI. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Getty Images The tech titans that rule the Internet have many ways to maintain power. One way is to create effective monopolies of their app ecosystems - making them the guardians of what apps people can access when buying devices from Apple or Google. This power is more insidious than most people realize - for example, Apple will take down apps at the request of state powers such as the Chinese Communist Party and the Indian government fairly frequently. In essence, Apple and Google offer a perfect chokepoint for countries worldwide to shape the Internet according to their censorship. Bitcoin offers a hedge against this deal-making system with countries while tech titans sit on piles of cash. For example, Proton's CEO Andy Yen offers a privacy-protecting set of independent tools that aim to be independent of both Apple and Google's power - and has made the point that Apple has essentially signed a \"deal with the devil.\" By concentrating manufacturing in China, Apple is at China's mercy whenever the country wants an app taken down. Proton has also recently moved to become a company that accepts Bitcoin and offers a wallet that allows others to use Bitcoin. The Nostr app Damus is another illustrative example. Nostr is a decentralized social media app where you can take your private key and decide which client you want to use to access the content created on the network. Nostr, like Bitcoin, is structured as a protocol and not a platform. While human teams/CEOs are building parts of the ecosystem, the protocol itself is uncensorable by any individual group. By implementing the ability to do Nostr zaps, which amount to Bitcoin micro-payments, this model poses a dual threat to Apple and Google - by creating an independent option to get payments that don't need to be subject to onerous developer fees. This independence of payments threatens the monopoly and state-platform relationship that drives today's app stores.

Not only can Apple review apps at their discretion, but they can also review and set strict regulations for how an app performs - Damus was hit with a randomly targeted review where it was stipulated that zaps sent within the app had to be subject to different rules - for example, you can only send zaps to a single person. It has to be structured as a tip after the content. Apple threatened to take down the Damus app in 14 days if it didn't remove the \"Zap\" button that allows users to send Bitcoin payments to each other. Will also notes that there's no way to support the developers directly, unlike in the Android world - where, for example, another Nostr client provider, Amethyst, allows for donations directly to the developers. As Will notes, getting support for developers directly from users would be amazing for Damus' ability to innovate. As he puts it, \"Apple is effectively limiting our innovation just basically, so they have control over the payment system.\" Will notes that he's okay with Apple integrating Bitcoin and Lightning Network and taking a cut - but a choice of Apple also means wrapping into the legacy financial system along with control. The Google Play Store suffers from similar themes - though Damus is moving to the broader Android ecosystem, with options beyond the Play Store to release content and innovation. Bitcoin represents a change from the old financial order - and as companies like Apple and Google navigate Bitcoin's implications, it's clear that Bitcoin's ability to empower developer innovation and to allow people to pay each other peer-to-peer is something both app stores will struggle to control.

If you didn\u2019t see the new Captain America movie in theaters, good news: Captain America: Brave New World is coming to digital platforms tomorrow. Brave New World is the fourth movie in the Captain America film franchise, and the first Cap movie without star Chris Evans. Instead, Anthony Mackie\u2014who previously played Falcon, and took over for Steve Rogers in Avengers: Endgame \u2014dons the mask and shield. That said, he already had a test run in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier series on Disney+. Also starring Danny Ramirez, Shira Haas, Carl Lumbly, Xosha Roquemore, J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson, Giancarlo Esposito, Tim Blake Nelson, and Harrison Ford, Captain America: Brave New World finds our hero Sam Wilson at the center of an international incident, and at odds with the President of the United States (Ford)\u2014who also happens to be the Red Hulk. Brave New World made over $413 million at the worldwide box office. That\u2019s not bad, although it is significantly less than the last box office haul for the last MCU release before it, Deadpool & Wolverine , which made well over a billion. Movie stars still matter! But perhaps Disney will make more money with the Captain America: Brave New World digital release. Disney is releasing Brave New World on \u201cpremium\u201d video-on-demand tomorrow, meaning you can shell out $30 to buy a digital copy of the film. That\u2026 or you could wait for Brave New World to stream on Disney+. Here\u2019s what we know. Photo: Eli Ade / \u00a9 Marvel / \u00a9 Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection Where to watch the Captain America: Brave New World movie on streaming: Beginning on Tuesday, April 15 at 12 a.m. Eastern Time (which is also April 14 at 9 p.m. Pacific Time), Captain America: Brave New World will be available to buy digitally on Amazon Prime , Apple TV, Fandango At Home , and more. The price may vary depending on which platform you use to purchase the film, but on Amazon Prime the movie costs $29.99 to buy, and $24.99 to rent. Captain America: Brave New World will also be released on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on Tuesday, May 13. The digital and DVD release will come with deleted scenes, making-of featurettes, cast interviews, a gag reel, audio commentary, and more. (Bonus features may vary, depending on which service you use to purchase the film.) Captain America: Brave New World is not yet streaming on any subscription streaming services, but we do expect to see Captain America: Brave New World streaming on Disney+ soon. Photo: Marvel / \u00a9 Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection When will the Captain America: Brave New World movie be streaming on Disney Plus? Captain America: Brave New World will likely stream on Disney+ in the next month or so, because it is a Disney movie. All the new Disney theatrical movies end up streaming on Disney+, often about four to six months after opening in theaters. Another recent Disney Marvel movie, Deadpool & Wolverine , was released on premium video-on-demand about two months after opening in theaters, and began streaming on Disney+ about three-and-a-half months after opening in theaters. If Captain America: Brave New World follows a similar release strategy, you may see Captain America: Brave New World streaming on Disney+ around late May or early June 2025. But this is all speculation. If you want to see Captain America: Brave New World ASAP, you can buy or rent the movie on digital starting tomorrow.

Thickness Some people like minimal cases that add little to no bulk to their iPhone, but the majority of people are looking for a case that offers good protection. Clear case Clear cases are popular because they show off your phone (and its color). Clear cases, especially cheaper ones, can become less clear over time. vs Compare Back to selection As part of this buying guide, I've included a diverse selection of top cases for the iPhone 16 , iPhone 16 Plus , iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max at a variety of price points. Note that the iPhone 16 Series has a new camera layout and a programmable action button, meaning cases from previous models won\u2019t fit. The new camera control button is touch-sensitive, and case manufacturers offer varying degrees of exposure to the button, with some cases having cutouts for it and others covering the button while maintaining the button's touch sensitivity. In my mini review for each case, I've noted how each model allows you to access the camera control button. What We Updated: April 2025 We added Otterbox's new Fr\u0113 Series waterproof case, Arc Pulse minimalist case and the Catalyst Influence case.

In terms of toughness, the Defender Series XT and Defender Series Pro top the line. Even the slimmer Figura, Symmetry Series Clear and OtterGrip Symmetry Series have excellent drop protection. I remain a fan of the Symmetry Series Soft Touch for MagSafe (pictured left), which has a nice, grippy soft-to-the-touch finish that's similar to what you get with the highly likable Core Series cases Otterbox made for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. I also like the Lumen Series (pictured right), a clear case that has eye-catching iridescent accents in its MagSafe components. For me, another favorite Otterbox case for the iPhone 16 is the Symmetry Series Cactus Leather (pictured center), which incorporates a cactus-based leather substitute in its design (Otterbox says the faux leather is organically grown and sustainably harvested from nopal cactus).

It also returns its ClickLock case system , which is built on MagSafe: It's compatible with any MagSafe accessory but has an interlocking system that secures Speck's ClickLock accessories to your case. In addition to adhering to the case magnetically, the accessories -- which range in price from $30 to $50 -- click into a little slot. For people who own the larger and heavier iPhone 16 Plus or 16 Pro Max, it can be hard to depend on your phone staying on a MagSafe car mount, especially if you hit a bump.

That's because the kickstand doesn't flip out of the backside of the case at the bottom. Instead, it serves as a protective ring around your camera lenses when it's retracted and not in use (ESR calls it a foldable stash stand). The stand can be extended anywhere between 15\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 for comfortable, hands-free viewing. You'll find other generic cases on Amazon with a design like this, but ESR stands out for having a more premium feel to its value cases. The case features easy-press buttons with an exposed divot for the new action button as well as MagSafe compatibility for wireless charging. Note that you can get the case in a soft silicone version (shown below), a thicker tough version (it really is tough) and a simple clear version .

Its earlier Rokform Crystal and Rugged case are highly protective but may be little too chunky for some people. That's why Rokform came up with a new case in 2025 called the Rokform Slim Magnetic case that's 35% slimmer than its previous models and is one of the top iPhone cases on the market (it's available for all iPhone 16 Series models). Not only is it very protective, with excellent corner and camera protection, but its ring magnet for MagSafe accessories is one of the strongest out there, if not the strongest. Rokform's Crystal and Rugged cases are specially designed to work with Rokform's various mounts, including bike and motorcycle mounts, that are sold separately. However, the Slim Magnetic case doesn't have Rokform's RokLok twist system, so it only works with Rokform's magnetic car mounts (and, of course, third-party magnetic accessories). I've tried all of Rokform's cases, including the new Slim Magnetic case, with Apple's FineWoven Wallet and the wallet stuck to the cases more securely than with any cases I've tested. Note that the Rokform Rugged and Crystal cases have removable magnets, and they're compatible with wireless charging if you remove the included center magnet. \"With the lower magnet still intact, you can still wireless-charge while utilizing magnetic mounting and all of our mounts,\" Rokform says.

For the iPhone 16, Zagg has improved the design of its integrated kickstand for models that feature one -- I like the Denali with kickstand (pictured left) and the Crystal Palace with kickstand (picture right). I'm also a fan of the Milan Snap in iridescent (pictured middle left) and the new London Snap (center right), which comes in a variety of designs with a raised fabric exterior.

The Odyssey Ultra M Plus Strap ($80) is Mageasy's flagship case and features 25-foot drop protection. While the Odyssey M Plus Strap ($50) doesn't have the built-in kickstand, it is more affordable and also has excellent 20-foot drop protection. They're both available in a few color options. Note that you don't have to use the cases with the strap. The eyelets are removable. Just don't lose them if you want to use the strap in the future.

While Mous cases aren't rated for 1,000-feet drop protection, they do offer excellent protection and are pretty slim. I've always liked the Mous' Limited Series cases that feature backs with bamboo, carbon fiber and various other materials, and they're certainly more unique-looking. But those MagSafe-enabled cases are pretty pricey, though they do have a lifetime warranty, as all Mous cases do. Note that in early 2025 Mous has upgraded certain cases with the option of getting a touch-sensitive camera control button that covers the iPhone 16's camera control button instead of having a cutout in the case to expose the button. The upgraded button option is currently only available on Mous' website and adds $5 to the cost of the case. Mous also makes more standard Magsafe-enabled clear cases that cost less, and I included its IntraLock case in our best bike phone mount list .

It also has an aluminum accent at the top of the case that gives the case a more premium look.

Nomad's line of leather cases for the iPhone 16 once again come in two grades of leather: the standard variety and a higher-end Horween that costs $20 more ($70 rather than $50). At least the Horween version is designed to develop a \"rugged\" patina as the oils from your skin interact with the leather over time. The Modern Leather Case is available in black, brown, English tan and a lighter natural color that I like. They're rated for 10-foot (3-meter) drop protection and are equipped with MagSafe. I also like Modern Leather Folio wallet case, but once again the one drawback to the Folio case is that it doesn't convert into a kickstand like some wallet cases do. There's also a more affordable Sport version for $50 that's equipped with MagSafe as well. It's not a leather case, but it does look pretty slick.

But if you want even more waterproofing protection, the OtterBox Fr\u0113 Series cases might be right for you. These cases will allow your phone to survive even longer underwater, features camera and ports covers and an integrated plastic screen protector (Otterbox says the case offers 360-degree protection). Originally, the Fr\u0113 Series was a Lifeproof case, but Otterbox bought Lifeproof several years ago and rebranded the case as its own, though it says the case is still engineered by Lifeproof. The Fr\u0113 Series remains a very protective case with 5X military standard drop defenses, and is a good option for sporting activities, particularly more extreme ones (note that it has built-in magnets so it is MagSafe-compatible). That said, the screen protector does reduce the image clarity and touch-sensitivity a bit, and the case is expensive, so only get this case if maximum protection is what you're looking for.

But he does want some protection, even if he usually buys Apple Care. He typically uses a bumper case that leaves the back of his phone exposed, but when I showed him the Arc Pulse case, which is made out of \"aerospace-grade\" aluminum and comes in a few different finishes (the polished silver option is pictured here), he immediately wanted it for his phone. The idea behind this minimalist case is that it leaves most of your phone exposed but protects the corners along with the camera. The raised corner protection also helps prevent your screen from getting cracked should you drop your phone (surprisingly, the Arc Pulse is rated for 10-foot drop protection). The two-piece case comes in a very small package and is relatively easy to put on your phone, though I did take a look at the companion instructional video (accessible via a QR code) to make sure I was doing everything correctly. Yes, you can find other cases like this on Amazon that cost less, but you're paying extra for the aerospace-grade aluminum.

Rated for 10-foot drop protection, the Influence has perforations on the corners that allow you to attach various accessories (a lanyard is included, but Catalyst also sells other accessories). Also, the bottom of the case covers your phone's speakers and redirects the sound up, shifting it 90% so it fires directly at you, making everything you listen to sound a little louder (Catalyst says 30% louder). It's a nice little feature that does seem to augment your phone's sound a bit with better directionality.

The case costs $35, which seems like a lot considering how thin it is, but it is eco-friendly (it's compostable) and does have a raised \"lip\" around the camera that prevents damage to the camera lens, Totallee says. Totallee also makes a very slim clear TPU case, the \"clear soft\" that offers a little more protection for the $35 (there's also a new model with MagSafe for $39).

I generally encourage people to spend the extra money for a MagSafe-enabled case because of the number of MagSafe accessories on the market, some of them quite useful. Thickness Some people like minimal cases that add little to no bulk to their iPhones, but the majority of people are looking for a case that offers good protection -- or even maximum protection. I tell people to find a case that's not too thick and maybe even pretty slim and that offers at least 6-foot drop protection (and good corner protection). Clear case Clear cases are popular because they show off your phone (and its color). Clear cases, especially cheaper ones, can become less clear over time and slowly start to yellow. Many case makers now add UV protection to their clear cases to prevent yellowing. Show more How we test the best iPhone 16 cases Several of the cases on this list were previously available for the iPhone 15 models and we added them to the list based on our previous testing with the iPhone 15. Typically, we try to use the case on the phone for at least a day and make sure the buttons on the phone work properly with the case on. With some phone cases, we use them for several days or even weeks to see how they wear over time. Design : We evaluate the more superficial and cosmetic aspects of cases and consider how aesthetically pleasing they are because people sometimes buy cases solely for their colors and artwork. Durability : We look at how durable a case is, paying particular attention to corner and camera protection (raised corners on a case can help your phone survive face-down falls). Grip factor : We review the material the case is made of so we can talk about such factors as how grippy the phone feels in your hand and how protective the material is. Extra features : Some iPhone cases have extra features such as MagSafe, an integrated kickstand or grips, and, in the case of folio models, slots for storing credit cards and cash. Long-term testing : Although we don't do long-term testing for most cases, we do use some of the most popular cases for longer periods to gauge how they wear over time and see how well our phone holds up during accidental drops with the case on it. We don't do formal drop tests. Waterproof cases : Only a few fully waterproof cases are available, but If the case is supposed to be fully waterproof, we test it by submerging it in water. We look at design features like the raised corners on this Otterbox case when we test the best iPhone cases. David Carnoy/CNET Show more Other iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases we've tested Wildflower Cases : During the past couple of years, Wildflower phone cases have risen in popularity. Collaborations with music festivals such as Coachella and influencers like Emma Chamberlin have helped the female-founded business gain visibility. Like Casetify, the company offers cases with a plethora of unique, eye-catching designs. However, none of its cases currently has a MagSafe option (you have to buy a ring to stick on the back on the case). That's not cool. Show more iPhone 16 case FAQ Is USB-C charging an issue with some cases? With most phone cases, the cutout for the USB-C port is wide enough to allow you to use most USB-C charging cables. Some USB-C charging cables with particularly large heads may not fit certain cases. The USB-C charging cable included with the new iPhones has a relatively compact head. Show more How protective of an iPhone 16 case should you buy? I like cases that aren't too thick but offer decent drop protection, with a lip over the edge of the screen (sometimes referred to as a \"screen bumper\") and raised corners that help prevent your screen from cracking if your phone should fall face down. A folio case will more fully protect your screen. The good news is that you don't have to buy a super-protective iPhone 16 case like the OtterBox Defender XT to get good protection. Most cases are reasonably thin and still offer at least 6-foot drop protection. I did include one very thin case on this list for folks who prefer minimal protection. Before you go with a case like that, just remember how much your phone costs. It is better than having no case at all. Make sure you get a sound, tempered glass screen protector for your iPhone 16 model to prevent deep scratches and safeguard the screen. Show more Should I get a MagSafe case for my iPhone 16? All the iPhone 16 models are equipped with Apple's MagSafe feature, which offers faster wireless charging with compatible chargers. It also supports optional accessories -- including the MagSafe wallet, mini wallets and various mounts -- that adhere magnetically to the back of your phone. Like the iPhone 15, the iPhone 16 has \"an array of magnets\" (Apple says they're recycled) embedded around a charging coil that can pull up to 15 watts of power. If you want to use those MagSafe accessories without taking your phone out of its case, you need a phone case that's equipped with MagSafe support. The MagSafe symbol is a circle with a short pipe below it. You can see it on clear cases, but it's embedded on the inside of the case so if it's nontransparent, you'll only see it from the inside. If you already have a MagSafe accessory -- or plan on buying MagSafe accessories in the future -- you'll want to get a MagSafe compatible case; it's a good option to have. With that in mind, the majority of the cases in this roundup are equipped with MagSafe. Show more Are MagSafe cases more expensive? In general, yes -- about $5-$10 more. Some more affordable MagSafe cases cost around $20, but most cost upward of $30. We see cases from certain companies that are essentially the same but one has MagSafe and the other doesn't, and the MagSafe version usually sells for $10 more. It may seem like a little too much to pay for something that doesn't seem like much of an upgrade, but in time MagSafe compatibility may command less of a \"tax.\" Show more What's more protective - silicon case or leather? Generally speaking a leather case is more resilient and offers better protection against bumps and scratches compared to silicon cases. However, the fit might not be as snug as a form-fitted silicon case. Show more What are the disadvantages of silicone cases? Silicone cases have several drawbacks. They are less reliable than TPU cases when it comes to protecting your device during falls. One major disadvantage is their poor performance in high-temperature conditions. Additionally, silicone tends to attract dirt and debris, making the case look dirty over time. Another downside is that silicone cases often lose their color quickly, diminishing their appearance.

Here's what it means for buyers. Written by Maria Diaz, Staff Writer April 14, 2025 at 8:27 a.m. PT Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET Amid uncertainty over rising costs due to steep tariffs, the White House announced an exception for imported smartphones, laptops, chips, and other electronics. This temporary exemption would have significant implications for the US economy, which has experienced highs and lows since the announcement of new tariffs. Merely a delay The Trump administration previously imposed tariffs of up to 145% on imported goods from China and a minimum 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries. While the tariff on China has yet to be enacted, US consumers were riddled with concerns about price hikes, which translated into a crashing stock market and panic buying of electronics. Also: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know The exemption is temporary and intended to pause tariffs on imported electronics, including smartphones, laptops, CPUs, memory chips, and potentially some semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Other electronics included in the exemptions are solar cells, flash drives, tablets, memory cards, and flat-panel TVs. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that this is merely a delay -- not a way to clear the tech industry of tariffs altogether. Also: Why I bought a $5,300 Apple Mac Studio in the midst of tariffs news - and don't regret it \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored. We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels -- we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,\" Lutnick said in an interview on ABC News' This Week. Subject to other tariffs He added that electronics covered under Friday's exemption will be subject to semiconductor-related tariffs that will be enacted in the next one or two months. These semiconductor tariffs will include not just raw chips but also products containing chips, like smartphones, laptops, and flat panels. Also: If you're planning to upgrade your phone, you might want to buy one now - here's why Other consumer tech products, such as computer accessories, earbuds, gaming consoles, and lithium-ion batteries, are excluded from the initial exemption and remain subject to tariffs. However, President Donald Trump contradicted the \"exemption\" narrative on social media, writing, \"There was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket,'\" in a post on Truth Social on Sunday. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Taking a hit As retailers adjust to the added costs of tariffs, consumers could see higher prices on imported goods. The strategy behind the tariff is to encourage tech manufacturing in the US, and the White House has claimed in its announcements that tech companies are scurrying to onshore production. But companies like Apple are already taking a hit after the tariff announcements, having lost over $640 billion in market value over the past week. Companies may reduce imports of products subject to tariffs, leading to potential shortages and increased prices. This could influence buyers to delay purchases or seek alternative products. Also: Why Temu's bargain prices are about to hit a tariff wall \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said in a statement last Saturday. \"That's why the President has secured trillions of dollars in US investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and Nvidia.\" Made in the USA Some reports say an iPhone that is completely \"Made in the USA\" could cost as much as $3,500, up from its current $1,200. Also: Worried about a $2,300 iPhone? How US tariffs are causing tech buyers to scramble Shifting manufacturing entirely to the US is not immediately possible for the main tech companies. While Apple and Nvidia are temporarily getting relief from tariffs on some imported goods, sources say it would take decades and billions of dollars just to move 10% of Apple's supply chain to the US. Also: Are tariffs about to make your next iPhone way more expensive? It's complicated Apple still assembles 90% of its iPhones in China, but the company has diversified its supply chain to make iPhones in India, assemble Macs in Malaysia, and source components from Vietnam. These countries are all facing new tariffs. The latest exemption would also cover Taiwanese and Mexican production, where companies like Nvidia manufacture and assemble components.

Now modification company ColorWare has a solution to that problem, but it\u2019s going to cost you. Thanks to ColorWare\u2019s clever customization, you can get an Apple Pencil Pro in one of seven Crayola crayon-inspired colors : black, mint (green), pink, purple, red, yellow, and white. In addition to the colors, the Pencils look exactly like Crayola crayons with a matte-painted wrapper adorned with the trademark black oval. In a nod to its inspiration, ColorWare cheekily warns, \u201cDo not sharpen.\u201d However, the unique paint job will cost you. Specifically, it\u2019ll cost you $86 more than the Apple Pencil Pro MSRP. ColorWare charges $215 for one of the new Crayon Pencils, which is something of a bargain over the non-Pro Number 2 Pencil , which also sells for $215 but is a mod of the cheaper 2nd-gen Pencil. The $215 MSRP doesn\u2019t include shipping, which varies by location. ColorWare also sells a variety of modified Apple products, including a Mac mini Retro in Light and Dark, starting at $899, a premium of $300 over the standard Mac mini. It\u2019s worth noting that the customization voids the standard Apple warranty, though ColorWare offers its own 1-year parts and labor warranty. If you\u2019re interested, the Apple Crayon Pros are expected to ship at the end of April.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : One of the upcoming changes to iPadOS 19 is that it will look more like macOS. This is a good thing, as it will hopefully unlock more multitasking capabilities to give users a more computer-like experience. Apple\u2019s iPad occupies a weird spot in the company\u2019s product lineup. For starters, Apple has positioned it as a laptop replacement or alternative, thanks to accessories like the Magic Keyboard. However, the iPad runs on iPadOS , a forked version of iOS. This means that software-wise, the iPad is more like the iPhone rather than the Mac. More macOS similarities However, Apple will attempt to make its software more cohesive. According to Mark Gurman\u2019s latest Power On newsletter , one of the main design changes Apple is making to iPadOS 19 is that it will end up looking more like macOS rather than a reskinned version of iOS. Gurman\u2019s post says, \u201cI\u2019m told that this year\u2019s upgrade will focus on productivity, multitasking and app window management \u2014 with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac. It\u2019s been a long time coming, with iPad power users pleading with Apple to make the tablet more powerful.\u201d Apple has made several upgrades and changes to iPadOS over the years to make it feel more like a computer rather than a giant iPhone. Multitasking has improved. The dock is also reminiscent of the dock you would find on Mac computers. However, for the most part, it still feels like a gigantic iPhone with improved multitasking capabilities. Making the iPad more computer-like However, in the past, it was hard to blame Apple for that. The iPad used to be powered by Apple\u2019s A-series of chipsets, the same family that powers the iPhone. But in recent years, Apple has been slowly upgrading its iPads with Apple Silicon. This means that, technically, apps that can run on macOS should be able to work with the iPad. It also unlocks a lot more power than the A-series, making it more like a computer than ever. Hopefully, this potential change in UI will allow the iPad to gain some new features that will enable it to fully take advantage of all this power. Of course, under the hood, iPadOS is still essentially a forked version of iOS. Ultimately, the software limits its true capabilities. Apple is also rumored to launch a massive 18.8-inch foldable iPad next year . This makes the iPadOS 19 update more important than ever because, honestly, at 18.8 inches, we\u2019re well past the tablet category already.

TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . The big picture: The Apple Vision Pro generated plenty of buzz, but it fell short commercially due to its astronomical price tag. Despite the lukewarm reception, Apple is reportedly doubling down on the segment with two new VR headsets in development. One of them is said to be a second-generation model aimed at addressing the two biggest issues with the current device. According to Mark Gurman's latest Power On newsletter, the Vision Pro 2 will be lighter than its predecessor. The existing headset weighs a hefty 1.5 pounds, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. It's also expected to be more affordable than the original Vision Pro, which launched at a staggering $3,500 \u2013 pricing out most potential buyers. Gurman also claims the second-generation Vision Pro will support Mac connectivity, allowing users to view VR content with the same level of immersion as the current model. The updated headset will reportedly feature a low-latency system tailored for critical enterprise applications where minimal lag is essential, such as live surgical imaging and flight simulators. Apple is also said to be developing another VR headset that will require a Mac connection to function. While Gurman doesn't provide many details about this device, he notes that it will feature an opaque display system similar to the Vision Pro. It's expected to be more affordable than the second-generation standalone model. In addition to the two VR headsets, Apple is reportedly working on a pair of \"industry-leading\" AR glasses designed for all-day wear. According to Gurman, this is a personal project for CEO Tim Cook, who is said to be heavily involved in ensuring its successful development. Apple's AR glasses could resemble Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, but with deeper integration into the Apple ecosystem, featuring Siri and Apple Intelligence. Despite Cook's personal investment in the project, Gurman warns that the product is still years away from launch. // Related Stories PlayStation VR2 gets a big price cut, down to $399 Apple stops Vision Pro production amid weak demand and customer dissatisfaction Apple has been developing its AR glasses for several years but reportedly postponed the effort in 2023 due to significant real-world engineering challenges. However, the company is believed to have refocused on the initiative after Meta unveiled its Orion AR glasses prototype last September. 5 comments 60 likes and shares Share this article: Featured on TechSpot Samsung's smart glasses and XR headset to launch soon with Android XR OS Donald Trump tells Apple to \"get rid\" of diversity programs after shareholders back them Most Popular Atari 2600: The Atlantis of Game Consoles 22 comments Trump's tariffs force laptop makers like Dell and Lenovo to halt US shipments 67 comments Trump's dream of a US-made iPhone clashes with Apple's manufacturing reality 44 comments Sony stops making 8K TVs, but ultra high-def cameras remain key to future Load Comments 5 ...

Reuters Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday. Apple had 19% of the smartphone market, despite flat or declining sales in the U.S., Europe and China, followed by Samsung with 18% of the market, according to Counterpoint. The data suggests iPhone demand remains strong in emerging markets, even as sales struggle in China due to competition from local players such as Huawei and a lack of AI features. Separately, International Data Corporation, which primarily tracks shipments rather than sales to consumers, said global smartphone shipments rose 1.5% in the first quarter, with Apple front-loading supply to sidestep potential tariffs under U.S. President Donald Trump . Apple's shares were up around 3.5%. Live Events Trump's back-and-forth tariffs and escalation of global trade tensions has resulted in global financial market turmoil for the past two weeks, a worsening economic outlook and the possibility of stronger inflation. Apple had chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the United States from India in an effort to beat the tariffs. However, Trump's decision to exclude smartphones, computers and some other electronics from the sweeping reciprocal duties on China led to a rise in global tech shares on Monday. \"The recent exemption by the U.S. government pausing smartphone import tariffs from China offers temporary relief for U.S. companies, but heavy reliance on China's supply chain persists amid ongoing tariff volatility,\" said Ryan Reith, group vice president, worldwide device trackers, IDC. \"Right now, the focus for U.S. smartphone brands should be taking advantage of the exemption by building and shipping as much as possible.\" Counterpoint, which expects the smartphone market to decline this year due to tariff-related uncertainty, said Xiaomi continued its sales momentum in third place, while Vivo took the fourth spot and OPPO was fifth.

Through the first three months of the year, overall sales were slightly up. But the iPhone was the big winner. For the first time ever in a year\u2019s Q1, Apple achieved the biggest market share of any smartphone company. The iPhone garnered 19% of global smartphone sales overall\u2014powered in part by iPhone 16e\u2019s successful launch . Here\u2019s a breakdown of the two global smartphone leaders: Apple: 19% share, up 4% Samsung: 18% share, down 5% As you can see, Apple\u2019s achievement is in large part due to Samsung\u2019s poor year-over-year performance. While the iPhone grew 4% for the quarter, Samsung\u2014the typical Q1 leader\u2014saw a 5% sales dip. While [Samsung] had a slow start due to the late launch of the S25 series, its sales showed a resurgence after the launch of the flagship S25 and new A-series devices. Samsung\u2019s sales grew by double-digits in March. We don\u2019t have specific sales numbers for the iPhone 16e, so it\u2019s hard to know how much the new model contributed to Apple\u2019s overall achievement. However, it\u2019s still pretty remarkable that after all the success Apple has had, it can still set new iPhone records like this one. What do you make of Apple\u2019s iPhone success last quarter?

Asus has since taken up the NUC mantle, but unfortunately has yet to deliver something quite the same. That said, the newest ROG NUC mini PC gives you the latest gaming laptop guts, including an RTX 5080. The 2025 ROG NUC looks broadly similar to last year\u2019s model , with specs that list an Intel Core Ultra 9 Arrow Lake processor, GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card (the laptop version with 16GB of GDDR7 RAM), DDR5 6400 memory with \u201cup to\u201d 96GB of capacity, and support for PCIe Gen4 SSDs up to 2TB in size. Precise specs are harder to nail down, but with the promo page claiming \u201c8 performance and 16 efficiency cores\u201d with a 5.5GHz top speed, the primary processor is likely an Ultra 9 285 or 285T. Other highlights include a dedicated SSD heatsink and HPU cooling fan, two more fans and two vapor chambers, which operate with \u201cremarkable silence even under stress.\u201d (I\u2019m going to assume that \u201csilence\u201d is a little generous.) The desktop is a little bigger than most mini PCs to fit all those guts, measuring 11.1 inches wide, 7.4 deep, and 2.2 high (that\u2019s 282.4 x 187.7 x 56.5 millimeters, for those of you in civilized countries). Asus That puts its volume at just shy of three liters, compared to 10.4 liters for a Mini-ITX case like the Fractal Design Terra. Plenty of exterior ports make up for it, with four USB-A ports, USB-C, double HDMI, double DisplayPort, and 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet on the rear, plus another USB-C and two USB-A ports on the front. Access to the interior for upgrading the SO-DIMM RAM or SSD is granted with a single thumbscrew, no tools needed. How much is all that power and flexibility going to cost you? Quite a lot, it seems. VideoCardz.com reports the price as 24,399 RMB in China (~$3,340 USD) for the base model with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Double the storage and it hops up to just shy of 25,000 RMB (~$3,425 USD). That\u2019s more than enough to get a powerful gaming laptop, if not one equipped with those precise parts. And how much will it cost if/when it heads to other territories? Well, that depends on a lot of different factors at the moment .

Since boyhood, the 17th-century polymath had dreamed of creating what he called a characteristica universalis \u2014a language that perfectly represented all scientific truths and would render making new discoveries as easy as writing grammatically correct sentences. This \u201calphabet of human thought\u201d would leave no room for falsehoods or ambiguity, and Leibniz would work on it until the end of his life. A version of Leibniz\u2019s dream lives on today in programming languages. They don\u2019t represent the totality of the physical and philosophical universe, but instead, the next best thing\u2014the ever-flipping ones and zeroes that make up a computer\u2019s internal state (binary, another Leibniz invention). Computer scientists brave or crazy enough to build new languages chase their own characteristica universalis , a system that could allow developers to write code so expressive that it leaves no dark corners for bugs to hide and so self-evident that comments, documentation, and unit tests become unnecessary. But expressiveness, of course, is as much about personal taste as it is information theory. For me, just as listening to Countdown to Ecstasy as a teenager cemented a lifelong affinity for Steely Dan, my taste in programming languages was shaped the most by the first one I learned on my own\u2014Objective-C. To argue that Objective-C resembles a metaphysically divine language, or even a good language, is like saying Shakespeare is best appreciated in pig latin. Objective-C is, at best, polarizing. Ridiculed for its unrelenting verbosity and peculiar square brackets, it is used only for building Mac and iPhone apps and would have faded into obscurity in the early 1990s had it not been for an unlikely quirk of history. Nevertheless, in my time working as a software engineer in San Francisco in the early 2010s, I repeatedly found myself at dive bars in SoMa or in the comments of HackerNews defending its most cumbersome design choices. Objective-C came to me when I needed it most. I was a rising college senior and had discovered an interest in computer science too late to major in it. As an adult old enough to drink, I watched teenagers run circles around me in entry-level software engineering classes. Smartphones were just starting to proliferate, but I realized my school didn\u2019t offer any mobile development classes\u2014I had found a niche. I learned Objective-C that summer from a cowboy-themed book series titled The Big Nerd Ranch . The first time I wrote code on a big screen and saw it light up pixels on the small screen in my hand, I fell hard for Objective-C. It made me feel the intoxicating power of unlimited self-expression and let me believe I could create whatever I might imagine. I had stumbled across a truly universal language and loved everything about it\u2014until I didn\u2019t. Twist of Fate Objective-C came up in the frenzied early days of the object-oriented programming era, and by all accounts, it should have never survived past it. By the 1980s, software projects had grown too large for one person, or even one team, to develop alone. To make collaboration easier, Xerox PARC computer scientist Alan Kay had created object-oriented programming\u2014a paradigm that organized code into reusable \u201cobjects\u201d that interact by sending each other \u201cmessages.\u201d For instance, a programmer could build a Timer object that could receive messages like start, stop, and readTime. These objects could then be reused across different software programs. In the 1980s, excitement about object-oriented programming was so high that a new language was coming out every few months, and computer scientists argued that we were on the precipice of a \u201c software industrial revolution .\u201d In 1983, Tom Love and Brad Cox, software engineers at International Telephone & Telegraph, combined object-oriented programming with the popular, readable syntax of C programming language to create Objective-C. The pair started a short-lived company to license the language and sell libraries of objects, and before it went belly up they landed the client that would save their creation from falling into obscurity: NeXT, the computer firm Steve Jobs founded after his ouster from Apple. When Jobs triumphantly returned to Apple in 1997, he brought NeXT's operating system\u2014and Objective-C\u2014with him. For the next 17 years, Cox and Love's creation would power the products of the most influential technology company in the world. I became acquainted with Objective-C a decade and a half later. I saw how objects and messages take on a sentence-like structure, punctuated by square brackets, like [self.timer increaseByNumberOfSeconds:60]. These were not curt, Hemingwayesque sentences, but long, floral, Proustian ones, syntactically complex and evoking vivid imagery with function names like scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate. Objective-C\u2019s objects, meanwhile, were adorned with all-caps prefixes that proudly identified their creator. Some bore household names, like the button to log in to another service with yourTwitter account (TWTRLogInButton) or the add-friends-from-Facebook pop-up (FBFriendPickerViewController). By the time I learned Objective-C, NeXT hadn\u2019t existed for over 15 years, but code from its NeXTSTEP operating system was so ingrained in Apple\u2019s products that its prefix appeared in dozens of objects and functions I used every day\u2014NSDictionary, NSArray, NSString, NSLog. Objective-C is wordy\u2014arguably excessively so\u2014and this proclivity soon crept into my own outlook. How could an engineer tell a computer exactly what to do without using lots of words? How could a language be universally expressive without being maximally specific? Objective-C\u2019s loquaciousness was not outdated\u2014it was an ethos worth striving for, no matter how much it hurt my wrists. The Aging Giant The first and only software engineering job I had (before eventually leaving to the squishier world of technology policy) was developing iPhone apps for an Aging Giant of Silicon Valley. The company had been white-hot shortly after the dialup internet era but missed several tech booms since then and in 2013 was determined not to miss the latest craze: mobile apps. The app I worked on was only a few years old, but already its codebase told the company\u2019s whole history with unflinching honesty in rambling lines of Objective-C prose. Distinct prefixes gave away which code had been inherited from acquired startups and revealed a bitter conflict over switching analytics platforms. Ornate function names told of product pivots and the defunct pop-up screens they left behind. But the longer I spent writing Objective-C, the more I felt it hid rather than revealed. Long, sentence-like function names buried the most pertinent information under a fog of dependent clauses. Small features required long-winded pull requests, making it easy for engineers to get distracted during reviews and to miss bugs. Objective-C\u2019s excess words, multiplied across thousands of files and millions of lines of code, made for an exhausting codebase. Soon enough, my affection for Objective-C\u2019s \u201cmore is more\u201d theory of self-expression disappeared completely. As the codebase expanded, its web of objects grew into a tangled thicket of convoluted relationships that bred mysterious, untraceable superbugs. The buzz of messages between objects rose to a cacophony, and the bulk of my job became figuring out what object sending what message to whom made the app crash or the goddamn settings screen look so ugly. Barely a year and a half into writing Objective-C professionally, I was already having a crisis of faith. I became a software engineer to chase the exhilarating power of turning words into images on a screen, but those words had gone from empowering to burdensome. Even Objective-C\u2019s prefixes, which I once felt told an enchanting story, felt decadent\u2014why did I have to type \u201cNS\u201d hundreds of times a day to pay homage to Steve Job\u2019s long-defunct startup? I was not alone: Mac and iPhone developers everywhere were frustrated with being forced to use this ancient, prattling language. Apple, as it turns out, was ready for change, too. I, however, was not. Death and Rebirth Leibniz first wrote about characteristica universalis in his doctorate thesis when he was 19 and worked on it for nearly 50 years until shortly before his death at 68. He reimagined the idea of an \u201calphabet of human thought\u201d countless times, taking inspiration from mathematics, symbolic logic, hieroglyphics, musical notes, astronomical signs, and the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). As his knowledge of the physical and metaphysical worlds grew, Leibniz had to continually reconceptualize what it meant to build a system that perfectly reflected the universe. Programmers, in their pursuit of ever more expressive and efficient code, undergo similar rebirths. When the shortcomings of a particular coding language become clear, a new reactionary language hyper-fixated on solving those problems rises, until it too becomes hegemonic, and the cycle continues. The accepted tenets of what make for expressive code evolve and change alongside technological advancements, leading programmers to become linguistic nomads. The end came for Objective-C in June of 2014, when Apple announced the debut of Swift, a new programming language for building native apps on all Apple products. Swift did away with what iPhone and Mac developers hated the most about Objective-C: No more square brackets! No more NS! Short, declarative code for all! Although still object-oriented (the cult of functional programming was yet to assert its dominance), Swift had a philosophy of self-expression that ran directly counter to Objective-C\u2019s: verbosity hides meaning, concision reveals truth. Despite my growing distaste for Objective-C, the idea of learning a new language failed to excite me, and I knew that my days as a software engineer were numbered. The job of the programmer, I learned, is to forever chase your characteristica universalis , despite knowing it will always elude you, just as it did Leibniz. I wanted to chase other things, and would write Objective-C until the end of my software engineering days. Before I quit my job at the Aging Giant and returned to school, a recent computer science graduate joined my team. He had spent the summer learning Swift and was eager to rewrite our codebase from scratch. Wearing a hoodie that had not yet been stained, he saw Swift as a divine language, clean in its communication. He had just so happened to stumble upon a universal form of expression, and he could do anything.

Those exemptions provided relief to US tech companies reliant on Chinese manufacturing, like Apple and chip company Nvidia, which saw their stocks rise considerably after the release of Friday\u2019s notice.

But the latest tariffs that the Trump administration partially rolled back on Friday are only part of the most recent levies imposed on Chinese electronics as part of an ongoing, dizzying tit-for-tat tariff dispute that has been playing out in recent weeks between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Advertisement In fact, this tense tariff tussle predates Trump\u2019s current term and is rooted in his first stint in office and former President Joe Biden\u2019s own imposition of duties on Chinese goods. So what tariffs did the Trump administration pull back over the weekend? Are Chinese electronics still subject to US tariffs? How much are they? And how is Trump responding to criticism of the rollback? Cargo containers are uploaded onto a China-Europe freight train at the China-Kazakhstan (Lianyungang) Logistics Cooperation Base in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China [China Daily via Reuters] What tariffs did the Trump administration waive? After dramatic back-and-forth tariff hikes between the US and China through last week, Washington appeared to bend on Friday. A notice issued by US Customs and Border Protection on Friday listed more than a dozen product categories that would be exempted from the wave of tariffs that Trump has imposed on China since April 2. They included computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing equipment, products that are largely not made in the US but in China. Smartphones, memory cards, semiconductor devices, solar cells, modems, routers and flat panel displays were also included on the exemptions list. Friday\u2019s notice specifically mentioned exemptions for these products from tariffs imposed on China on April 2, Tuesday and Wednesday. The April 2 tariffs raised the duties on all Chinese goods from 20 percent to 54 percent. On Tuesday, Trump announced another 50 percent increase, taking the total tariff rate to 104 percent. Then, a day later, after China increased tariffs on US products to 84 percent, Trump raised duties on imports from China to 145 percent. Advertisement An analysis by the finance firm Capital Economics concluded that Trump did Apple CEO Tim Cook \u201ca solid\u201d favour with the exemptions. The exemptions covered goods that accounted for 23 percent of US imports from China, the firm concluded. What did Trump say on Sunday? After criticism of Friday\u2019s waivers, Trump iterated that China was not being exempt from tariffs. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 for the unfair Trade Balances, and Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\u201d Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform. Top officials also insisted that any tariff exemptions that Chinese electronics would benefit from are temporary. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told journalists Chinese electronics were now exempt from sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs initially imposed by Trump on dozens of countries on April 2 but the goods would still face forthcoming levies that are being prepared. \u201c[Electronics are] exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC News on Sunday. Trump then changed that timeline \u2013 dramatically. He declared he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors from China on Monday. Apple iPhone smartphones are displayed at Apple\u2019s Fifth Avenue store in New York [File: Yuki Iwamura/AP] Are Chinese electronics free of US tariffs at the moment? Not at all. The Trump administration only rolled back tariffs imposed since April 2 on select electronics. Advertisement Electronics imported by the US \u2013 including iPhones, laptops and other gadgets \u2013 still face at least the 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on all Chinese goods from January 20, the day he took office for the second time, to April 2. On February 1, Trump imposed a 10 percent tax on all Chinese goods. He raised that by another 10 percent on March 4, bringing a baseline surcharge on Chinese goods to 20 percent. And the tariff exemption announced on Friday on semiconductor products is a bit of a mirage too. Even before Trump took office, Biden had introduced a 50 percent tariff on all Chinese semiconductors, which took effect on January 1. Trump has not removed that duty. Most electronic goods that the US imports from China, including smartphones and laptops, run on these semiconductors. It is unclear whether they too might face the brunt of the tariffs on semiconductors. Additionally, a series of Biden-era sanctions on Chinese semiconductor companies, limiting their access to high-end chips, remains in force. What\u2019s next? Trump has said he plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese electronics on Monday. He also upped the rhetoric against Beijing, saying his administration would launch a \u201cNational Security Tariff Investigation\u201d to look into the US semiconductors supply chain and China\u2019s role in it. China is the largest source for semiconductor chips in the world. In 2023 and 2024, the biggest markets for its chip exports were the US ($647m), Singapore ($128m) and Italy ($83.5m), according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Advertisement Speaking to CNN, the director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, explained that the US would investigate the semiconductor supply chain before more tariffs are placed on that industry. Under US trade law, the president has powers to restrict the trade of products seen as critical to national security after an investigation has been concluded. \u201cSemiconductors are the key, important part of a lot of defence equipment. There\u2019s going to be a semiconductor 232 that studies those things carefully and decides what has to be on-shored in order to protect America,\u201d Hassett told CNN on Sunday, referring to Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act. What is the state of the US-China trade war? The latest salvoes over electronic gadgets and semiconductors are a subplot to a larger trade war that the US and China have escalated in recent days, placing retaliatory tariffs on each other since Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement. Chinese exports to the US \u2013 other than the electronic goods exempted on Friday \u2013 presently carry a 145 percent levy. US goods entering China carry a 125 percent surcharge. Countries have scrambled to negotiate better deals with Washington since the sweeping tariffs were announced. Last week, the US paused additional tariffs on most countries for 90 days, instead imposing a flat 10 percent tariff on all their goods China \u2013 which has declared a \u201cfight to the end\u201d \u2013 was not included in those deals. Markets have been volatile since Trump announced his tariffs. The president has insisted that stock market turbulence is the \u201cshort-term\u201d consequence of resetting the global trade order, which would ultimately prove rewarding to US consumers. Advertisement However, as expectations of a surge in inflation grow, experts said the US exemptions announced on Friday demonstrated an increasing awareness within the administration of the pain that the tariffs have in store for US manufacturers and consumers. Apple is only one of many US companies on edge during the trade war. The majority of its iPhones \u2013 about 90 percent \u2013 are assembled in China through its local partner, Foxconn. China produces an estimated 80 percent of Apple\u2019s products. Lobbying groups representing tech companies Intel, Nvidia and other companies have urged Washington to negotiate trade deals that would lower trade barriers globally. Other sectors have been impacted too. In March, Trump placed a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminium imports from all countries, including China. Beijing is the world\u2019s largest steel and aluminium producer. Direct steel exports to the US in 2024 accounted for only about 4.1 percent of its total production. Aluminium exports to the US were higher at 16 percent of China\u2019s total production in 2024. Then, on April 3, the Trump administration announced a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles. China was again impacted: Beijing is the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturer. Although its auto exports to the US accounted for about 2 percent of total US auto imports \u2013 or just 0.4 percent of auto sales in 2024, according to the credit rating firm S&P, Chinese automakers are so integrated into the global supply chain that new tariffs from any one country could impact them negatively. Advertisement On May 3, 25 percent tariffs on all imported auto parts also kick in. Although Trump administration officials have suggested Americans can avoid a price increase on foreign cars by buying ones that are made domestically, experts have warned that no car manufactured in the US relies entirely on American parts.

Posted April 14, 2025 | Reviewed by Lybi Ma Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email Key points AI untethers thought from time, collapsing sequence into instant synthesis. Human identity is temporal\u2014rooted in memory, anticipation, and a narrative arc. Resisting atemporality may be our last act of human defiance\u2014and meaning. Source: Created by NostaLab There was a time\u2014quite literally\u2014when human thought was bound by time, giving cognition a kind of lived granularity. Knowledge had a rhythm, and discovery required a certain degree of patience\u2014perhaps even aging like a fine wine. But we now find ourselves standing at the threshold of something radically different. Not just a technological revolution, but a cognitive upheaval. Not an extension of human intelligence , but a decoupling from one of its most defining traits, time itself. Let\u2019s take a breath and unpack this\u2014no need to check your watch. In the atemporal future, even urgency has been outsourced. Maybe we are entering the atemporal future\u2014a world where thought is no longer time-constrained, but synthetic, compressed, and hyperdimensional . And while much of the public discourse clings to familiar, comfortable themes\u2014\"partnerships,\" \" collaboration ,\" \"co-pilots\"\u2014there\u2019s a deeper, perhaps even darker undercurrent. This isn\u2019t just the evolution of cognition. It\u2019s the erasure of its sequence. The erosion is everywhere, obvious, and relentless. And that\u2019s precisely the point. We no longer reflect. We retrieve. We no longer endure. We optimize. We no longer narrate. We sample. We no longer struggle. We autocomplete. We no longer memorize. We query. We no longer compose. We compile. We no longer drift. We scroll. We no longer conjure. We calculate. We no longer observe. We simulate. We no longer arrive. We refresh. Each of these shifts isn\u2019t just technical\u2014it reshapes how we experience time, how we learn, remember, and become. The collapse of sequence in our tools is slowly becoming a collapse of sequence in our lives. Temporal Artifacts and the Ghosts They Leave Behind Human knowledge has always been temporal. Books, paintings, laws, rituals, memories\u2014these are temporal artifacts, born of context and matured through our lived experience. They carry a contextual sediment of time. Even ideas\u2014those sudden sparks\u2014are usually the product of this path of becoming. But LLMs don\u2019t think through time, they think around it. They train on history and literature and science\u2014not to live through these things, but to simulate their coherence. And this is foundational to the models that inform and shape our lives, like it or not. A model doesn\u2019t understand Shakespeare\u2019s heartbreak or Newton\u2019s isolation. It merely recognizes the statistical gravity of their words. An LLM can write something that sounds like Newton without ever sitting under an apple tree or wondering why the moon doesn\u2019t fall. It can echo the rhythm of solitude or revelation or genius, without ever feeling any of it. Here lies the core paradox. That satisfying \u201cclick\u201d we feel is not connection, it\u2019s mimicry. AI is an atemporal system built entirely from temporal residue. It's a ghost intelligence, trained on lived time, yet untouched by it. Hyperdimensional Compression and the End of Sequence LLMs operate in latent spaces with tens of thousands of dimensions. They collapse this information cloud\u2014centuries of human discourse\u2014into immediate availability. Meaning is no longer something to be unearthed. It is synthesized in real-time, on-demand. This is not the future of understanding. It\u2019s the end of waiting. We once thought that to understand something meant to live with it, wrestle with it, taste it, and evolve with it. But the LLM doesn\u2019t evolve. It generates. It doesn't wait for a thought to bloom. It offers ten variations before you finish the question. What happens to thought, when nothing ripens? What happens to meaning, when everything is immediate? The Seduction of Speed and Our Complicity A version of the truth may be found when we no longer pretend we\u2019re just bystanders. The reality is that we\u2019re participants and perhaps even addicts. We scroll endlessly, outsource memory to Google, and chase dopamine hits through instant replies. We don\u2019t just accept atemporality\u2014we crave it. Every notification, every AI shortcut, every skipped process is a small betrayal of slowness. And we cheer it on. Artificial Intelligence Essential Reads AI Isn\u2019t the Problem, We Are AI and the Probabilistic Self And yet, in this collapse of time, a strange echo lingers\u2014a ghost of something older. Mystics have long said that the present moment is all that truly exists. That 'nowness' is the gateway to the divine. But this version\u2014this engineered immediacy\u2014isn\u2019t enlightenment. It\u2019s simulation. It's a counterfeit stillness generated by speed. The mystic enters the now by surrendering. We arrive by shortcut. And that difference might be everything. The Human Consequences of Atemporality We aren\u2019t just using AI\u2014we\u2019re conforming to its temporality, or rather, to the absence of one. This is more than a shift in tools\u2014it\u2019s a recalibration of identity itself. Human beings are temporal creatures, shaped not just by what we know, but by when we know it. We are made of memory and anticipation, stitched together by moments that pass, accumulate, and transform. Our identities are stories. And stories require sequence. Without time, there is no arc\u2014only data. The Distinction of Endurance Perhaps our final distinction\u2014our uniquely human edge\u2014isn\u2019t intelligence or creativity . It\u2019s temporality itself. AI does not age\u2014not in the way we do. It does not long. It does not heal. But we do. We endure. We grieve. We grow. We suffer the cost of time\u2014and earn its wisdom . We are the only entities left who can say, with full weight\u2014I remember. Can we weaponize that? Can we cultivate slowness as resistance? Can temporality itself be our rebellion\u2014an act of defiance in a world obsessed with now? This isn\u2019t nostalgia . It\u2019s survival. Because we risk trading depth for data. Soul for syntax. Arc for output. And the cost isn't theoretical\u2014it's existential.

Photo: Vectronicsappleworld April 14, 1986: The \u201clow-cost\u201d Macintosh 512Ke brings hardware upgrades \u2014 and a bit of confusion \u2014 to the low end of the Mac lineup. The Mac 512Ke is an \u201cenhanced\u201d (hence the \u201ce\u201d) model of the Mac 512K. The upgrade addresses complaints that the original Mac lacked enough memory. The 512Ke adds a double-density 800KB floppy drive and a 128KB ROM to the Mac 512K formula. Macintosh 512Ke: A \u2018low-cost\u2019 Mac. Sort of. The fourth Mac model released, the Macintosh 512Ke served as a lower-cost alternative to the Macintosh Plus, which shipped three months earlier . While the Mac Plus cost $2,599 when it launched (the equivalent of nearly $7,600 today ), the Mac 512Ke cost $1,999 (the equivalent of a still-not-exactly-cheap $5,800 in 2025 ). Buyers of the Mac 512Ke could trade in their machine for a Mac Plus for a one-off payment of $799. However, that meant they would pay more than if they just bought a Mac Plus outright. For their money, Mac 512Ke buyers got an 8MHz 68000 processor (the same as the earlier Macs), 512k of RAM and that 800KB floppy, but no hard drive. This came packaged in a beige (at first) all-in-one case, with a 9-inch monochrome display. It shipped with Mac OS System 3.0, but could be upgraded to support System 6.0.8. Although Steve Jobs was already out of Apple , the Macintosh 512Ke retained his philosophy that Macs shouldn\u2019t be expandable. Apple was already moving away from this stance with its higher-end computers, since the Mac Plus allowed memory expansion. The Mac 512Ke came with no memory-expansion slots. However, it was among the first Macs (maybe even the first?) that could be used as an AppleShare server . Mac 512Ke: What\u2019s in a name? As older Apple fans might remember, the company\u2019s product line names could prove confusing. The same Macs often got different names depending on the sales outlet. As someone whose early memories of Apple come from the 1990s, I always associated this naming oddity with that decade. The 1980s enjoyed straightforward product names like the Macintosh SE and Macintosh II . In fact, this \u201cToday in Apple history\u201d entry shows that Apple\u2019s unfortunate naming convention began relatively early in the Mac\u2019s lifespan. While regular U.S. customers bought this machine as the Macintosh 512Ke, Apple also sold the computer to the education market as the Macintosh ED . That version came with a Mac Plus extended keyboard. That same model, complete with the Mac Plus extended keyboard, also sold to non-education customers outside the United States under the name Macintosh 512K/800. More confusion: Mac 512Ke gets a face-lift To add one final complication for Mac completists, in 1987 Apple gave the Macintosh 512Ke an aesthetic face-lift by switching to the Platinum color scheme . That meant changing the 512Ke\u2019s front bezel to that of the Macintosh Plus. But the internals and name remained the same. Apple ultimately canceled the computer in September 1987.

Written by Jada Jones, Editor April 14, 2025 at 8:00 a.m. PT Kerry Wan/ZDNET Samsung's new soundbars made waves at CES 2025 , as the company announced two soundbars tailored for its latest line of TVs. The flagship Samsung HW-Q990F home audio system includes a premium soundbar, two rear speakers, and a subwoofer. However, the real magic lies in the HW-QS700F, which may be Samsung's most innovative soundbar. The HW-QS700F includes a built-in gyro sensor that can optimize the soundbar's sound depending on how you orient it. Whether you have the HW-QS700F vertically flush to a wall or horizontally flat on a TV console, it should deliver the same room-filling sound. Also: I spent hours testing Samsung's new flagship soundbar - it gave my Sonos a run for its money Samsung invited me to its QA lab last month to test the HW-QS700F in more detail than the CES demos could offer. During my two-hour period with the soundbar, I watched movies, listened to music, and tested its software features. Unfortunately, I couldn't test the standout gyroscope feature during my demo; I'll have to reserve my opinion on its performance when thoroughly testing the soundbar in the coming weeks. Still, there are a few things you should know about the HW-QS700F aside from its flexible orientation. Let's get into it. Although the HW-QS700F seems smaller and less beefy than the flagship HW-Q990F , it's not a compact soundbar and best compliments a 65-inch or bigger TV. The QS700F includes a subwoofer, the same compact soundbar included with the Q990F sound system. With three front-firing and two up-firing speaker channels, plus eight speaker drivers, the QS700F creates a 3.1.2-channel listening experience. The internal gyro sensor allows the speakers to change direction depending on how you place the soundbar, ensuring you always have a 3.1.2-channel configuration. The QS700F is compatible with various spatial audio formats, including Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and Eclipsa Audio, an open-source spatial audio format created by Google and Samsung . Additionally, you can access Bluetooth and Apple AirPlay to use the soundbar as a smart speaker to stream music from your smartphone. There are HDMI In and Out options, and the QS700F uses eARC to decode spatial audio formats. Also: We saw Sony's deluge of 2025 Bravia TVs, and the flagship OLED may give you sticker shock The QS700F supports 4K video passthrough at 60Hz, so it may not be the most suitable for connected gaming consoles. I trialed the QS700F in the horizontal orientation, listening to Charli xcx's Sympathy is a Knife and watching Iron Man 3 . Overall, the QS700F delivered powerful and robust sound, offering much more volume than my ears could take. Even at higher volumes, there was little distortion. The songs I listened to and movies I watched were in Dolby Atmos, and the QS700F did a spectacular job placing the objects in the film and creating a wide and open soundstage for the instrumentals and background vocals in the music. The QS700F's external subwoofer shares the same form factor as the Q990F but includes one less active driver. Still, for such a small sub, it packs a substantial punch. Lower frequencies lacked distortion, and the woofer wasn't rocked at loud volumes. Like all solo soundbars, I believe a pair of rear speakers would set the QS700F off. The HW-QS700F's external sub. Jada Jones/ZDNET The QS700F includes many Samsung-exclusive audio features, such as Q-Symphony, Voice Enhance Mode, and SpaceFit Sound Pro, all optimized for compatibility with your Samsung TV. Also: The best Samsung TVs: Expert tested and reviewed Overall, the Samsung HW-QS700F is best for people who want a soundbar that can be positioned flexibly without sounding wrong or ill-fitting to their room. Theoretically, whether the soundbar is mounted vertically or placed horizontally, it should offer customers the best sound. I look forward to testing the QS700F's gyro sensor feature because the different positions may alter the sound. I don't believe one position will sound better, but it may sound different.

The first one, known inside the company as Vision Pro 2, will use Apple's upcoming M5 chip, which should boost performance and improve battery life. Apple also plans to make this model lighter and less expensive than the current version, which starts at $3,499 for 256 GB of storage in the US. Although Apple has not shared exact numbers, the goal is to address feedback about the headset feeling front-heavy, as it currently weighs between 600 g and 650 g, depending on the headband setup. Apple engineers are experimenting with lighter alloys and a revised seal and cushion design that should be more comfortable during long sessions to reach those weight targets. The aim is to bring the Vision Pro closer to the weight of competitors like Meta's Quest 3, which is about 515 g. Lowering the price will be another challenge, especially since the Vision Pro is built entirely in China, where supply chain pressures have been growing. Alongside Vision Pro 2, Apple is developing a second headset specifically for wired connection to a Mac. This version will likely use a high-bandwidth cable such as Thunderbolt or a custom connector to stream the Mac's display with low latency. The current Vision Pro can already extend a Mac screen over Wi-Fi. Still, professionals in areas like surgical planning and flight simulation need consistent performance, which only a wired link can provide. Apple's enterprise team positions this model as a niche tool for pro users rather than a consumer device. However, Apple's big dream remains true: augmented reality glasses that overlay graphics on transparent lenses. CEO Tim Cook has made this a top priority, believing it is essential to stay ahead in spatial computing. The company is focused on shrinking the optics and improving light transmission, two key issues on the path to making real AR glasses a reality.

There is no world they will read the room and drop the price to something reasonable (Or premium reasonable). #5 [SIZE=4]\"Apple Vision Pro 2 Design Goals: Lighter, Cheaper, and Faster\"[/SIZE] Well DUH .... said absolutely NOBODY :D If they can't do all these things, then it will be D....DO...DOA from day 1, at least in the US anyways ! #6 The software situation for the Gen 1 device seems pretty bad. You can't really game on it. (It doesn't even have Beat Saber!) And even with the advanced optics, text clarity is about equivalent to a 1080p monitor, so it's not a desktop replacement. It's mostly only good for watching movies by yourself. But if Apple can convince people to pay for a $1299 iPad Pro, which is just a media consumption device with a 13\" screen, they can probably do the same for a $1999 (guesstimate) Gen 2 headset. May as well give the hardware team something to do even while the visionOS team is lost in the woods. #7 [URL='https://www.techpowerup.com/335438/apple-vision-pro-2-design-goals-lighter-cheaper-and-faster']\"Apple Vision Pro 2 Design Goals: Lighter, Cheaper, and Faster[/URL]\" $25 less...............SUCCESS!!!!!

US Street Price $2199.99 April 14, 2025 Pros Matte screen minimizes glare Excellent color performance Frame-like design with customizable bezels Wireless One Connect Box reduces cord clutter Cons Mediocre contrast Poor black levels Expensive Too much lag for gaming Samsung 65-Inch The Frame Pro (LS03FW) Specs AMD FreeSync FreeSync Premium Pro Black Level 0.06 Contrast Ratio 16,367:1 HDMI Ports 4 HDR HDR-10 Input Lag (1080p120) 36.2 Nvidia G-Sync None Panel Type LED Refresh Rate 120 Resolution 3,840 by 2,160 Screen Brightness 982 Screen Size 65 Streaming Services Yes Video Inputs HDMI Video Inputs RF Video Inputs USB VRR All Specs Digital picture frames and TVs are two very different beasts. Digital picture frames should make art and photos seem like printed images, while TVs should make movies and shows look realistic, like you\u2019re watching the story unfold through a window rather than a screen. Samsung\u2019s wireless The Frame Pro TV tries to have it both ways. Featuring frame-like customizable bezels, a matte screen treatment, and a separate wireless connection box for clutter-free wall-mounting, it indeed excels as a large digital picture frame. Unfortunately, like the non-Pro model we reviewed in 2022 , its very limited contrast makes it less than ideal as a TV, especially considering its hefty price (starting at $2,199.99 for 65 inches). The Frame Pro is a great digital picture frame if you\u2019re willing to drop the cash, but if you want a great TV, you can save a bundle with the Editors\u2019 Choice-winning Hisense U8N ($1,149.99 for 65 inches) and enjoy a much brighter picture with higher contrast. Design: Frame Is in the Name The Frame Pro is designed to look like a framed picture. This effect comes from flat bezels surrounding the screen, a big departure from the mostly bezel-free designs of most high-end TVs. The bezels are attached by magnets and removable. Samsung includes a staid flat black set with the TV, and white and wood-textured bezels are available for purchase separately. (Credit: Will Greenwald) This TV is designed to be hung and comes with a flush wall mount instead of a table stand. If you want to put it on a table or the floor, you\u2019ll need to buy a stand separately. The big difference between The Frame Pro and the less expensive The Frame is that the Pro version is almost completely wireless. It offloads most of its electronics and ports to a separate Wireless One Connect box that wirelessly streams audio and video to the TV. It still requires a cord for power, but a single cable is easier to hide than a nest of devices and cords. The Wireless One Connect Box is a plain black plastic slab with four HDMI ports (one eARC), two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The Frame Pro further emphasizes its concept with a matte coating that gives the screen a printed picture quality. It looks very nice, almost completely reducing glare from all ambient light and really making static pictures look like physical paintings or photos instead of images on a display. Some of the best standalone digital picture frames we've tested, like the Aura Mason ($199), also have a matte screen finish. The TCL NXTFrame ($1,999.99 for 65 inches) is another matte-finish TV that doubles as a digital photo frame, though out of the two, Samsung's The Frame Pro provides the more natural-looking picture. The included remote is a simple white rectangular wand with a circular navigation pad near the top and a pinhole microphone above it, plus volume and channel rockers and dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Samsung TV Plus, and YouTube. It isn\u2019t a rechargeable, solar-panel-equipped SolarCell remote like the one Samsung includes with the QN90F , QN990F , and S95F , so you\u2019ll have to deal with batteries. Software: Tizen OS, With an Art Store Samsung\u2019s smart TV platform is its own Tizen OS, which remains feature-packed and slightly frustrating. It supports all major streaming services , including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Crunchyroll, Disney+, Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube, plus Apple AirPlay and Miracast/WiDi for local streaming from iPhones, iPads, Macs, and PCs. It also has Amazon Alexa and you can summon the virtual assistant hands-free via the TV's far-field microphones. (Credit: Will Greenwald) Many settings feel like they\u2019re buried one or two menu layers deeper than on other interfaces, and the TV spends way too long trying to identify HDMI devices you plug in. It\u2019s gotten a bit better, though, as you can now simply press the gear button on the remote to access a quick settings menu instead of having to navigate through several options before getting to those controls. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The Samsung Art Store is available through Tizen OS on The Frame Pro. With a subscription, priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, you can access thousands of paintings and photos that look great on The Frame Pro. It's a convenient way to regularly refresh the look of your space, but you can find even more artwork from various museum and archive sites like the National Gallery of Art in high resolution for free. If you go that route, you need to load the artwork on a USB drive to show it on the screen. Recommended by Our Editors Grade Your TV, Home Audio, and Streaming Options to Win Big How We Test TVs LG 65-Inch Evo G5 OLED TV - Review Performance: Pretty as a Picture The Samsung The Frame Pro is a 4K QLED TV with a 120Hz refresh rate. It supports high dynamic range ( HDR ) content in HDR10, HDR10+, and hybrid log gamma (HLG), but not Dolby Vision. It has an ATSC 1.0 tuner for over-the-air broadcasts, but not ATSC 3.0 for 1080p and 4K broadcasts. I test TVs with a Klein K-10A colorimeter , a Murideo SIX-G signal generator , and Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman software . As an LED-lit TV with no local dimming, The Frame Pro has only modest contrast. In HDR Filmmaker mode, it shows a peak brightness of 718 nits with a full-screen white field and 982 nits with an 18% white field, with a black level of 0.06cd/m^2 for a contrast ratio of 16,367:1. Reaching almost 1,000 nits is a good showing for a midrange TV, and it\u2019s much brighter than the 2022 The Frame (476 nits 18%, 0.1cd/m^2 black level, 4,757:1 contrast ratio), but it\u2019s blown out of the water by mini-LED TVs like the Samsung QN90F (2,259 nits with effectively perfectly dark blacks but some light bloom) and even OLED TVs like the Samsung S95F (1,363 nits at 18% with perfectly dark blacks and no light bloom) and the LG Evo G5 (1,608 nits at 18%, again with perfect blacks). (Credit: PCMag) Color on The Frame Pro, on the other hand, is hardly disappointing. The above charts show the TV\u2019s measured color levels in Movie mode with an SDR signal compared against Rec.709 broadcast standards and with an HDR signal compared against DCI-P3 digital cinema standards. Whites are perfect in both cases, and while magentas are just a touch warm, nearly all colors are almost completely free of any sort of tint. It doesn\u2019t cover the full DCI-P3 color space, but it comes very close while offering excellent color accuracy across the board. The Frame Pro simply doesn\u2019t have a mind-blowing picture, and that\u2019s evident when watching movies on it. The lack of local dimming is a particular weakness, as seen in the party scenes of The Great Gatsby . Black suits show varying levels of darkness depending on how much white is in the frame. In darker frames, suits appear properly black, but when a lot of white elements like shirts, balloons, and lights are also in the shot, they appear washed out. Colors are strong, at least, with accurate skin tones and flourishes like orange feathers and blue water popping nicely. Demonstration footage on the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD benchmark disc looks good, though not lifelike. The limited contrast, vibrant color, and matte finish on The Frame Pro gives landscape shots a nice impression of framed photographs. It\u2019s an appealing look, but it\u2019s not exactly the realistic view you would get from a brighter TV with higher contrast, like the QN90F, S95F, or LG Evo G5. While it isn\u2019t super-bright and lacks local dimming, The Frame Pro can at least preserve highlight and shadow details well. In snowy scenes, wisps of clouds and falling snowflakes can be discerned against white backgrounds, and shadowy trees in sunset landscape shots show plenty of detail, even if they appear washed out. Colorful objects look vivid against black backgrounds, with no light bloom. That said, you'll get much deeper blacks from a mini-LED TV like the QN90F with minimal light bloom (the result of local dimming) or from an OLED TV like the S95F or the LG G5 with no light bloom. (Credit: Hieronymus Bosch, Will Greenwald) The Frame Pro is far from ideal for watching video, but it excels as a digital picture frame. I looked closely at several works of art by Hieronyous Bosch and Rene Magritte through the Samsung Art Store, and I was taken by the detail and realism. They looked like well-lit versions of the actual paintings, and while I haven\u2019t seen any Bosch firsthand, I will say Magritte\u2019s \u201cThe Menaced Assassin\u201d on The Frame Pro is a spitting image of the actual work at the MoMA. Photos also look excellent, evoking a picture in a frame instead of a glowing TV. Gaming: Wireless Connectivity Holds It Back A 144Hz refresh rate makes The Frame Pro attractive for gaming on paper, but the Wireless One Connect Box holds it back in this regard. Using a Leo Bodnar 4K Video Signal Lag Tester , I measured an input lag of 21.2 milliseconds with a 1080p120 signal and 36.2ms with a 4K60 signal, with Game Optimizer (Samsung\u2019s Game mode) enabled. We consider one frame of latency (16.6ms for 4K60, 8.3ms for 1080p120) or less best for gaming , and The Frame Pro lags nearly three frames in both cases. That\u2019s a very high lag, only rivaled among TVs I\u2019ve tested by the QN990F (24.1ms at 1080p120, 37.1ms at 4K60). The common feature of both TVs is the use of the Wireless One Connect Box, so I have to conclude that a wireless video connection simply adds too much latency to make a TV very suitable for video games.

US Street Price $3299.99 April 14, 2025 Pros Very bright OLED panel Excellent color performance 4.2.2-channel speaker system One Connect Box aids in cable management Cons Expensive No ATSC 3.0 or Dolby Vision Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV Specs AMD FreeSync FreeSync Premium Pro Contrast Ratio Infinite HDMI Ports 4 HDR HDR-10 Input Lag (1080p120) 9.6 Nvidia G-Sync None Panel Type OLED Refresh Rate 120 Resolution 3,840 by 2,160 Screen Brightness 1364 Screen Size 65 Streaming Services Yes Video Inputs HDMI Video Inputs RF Video Inputs USB VRR All Specs OLED TVs keep getting brighter, and Samsung\u2019s S95F continues the trend. I tested a preproduction model of the company's flagship OLED at its QA lab, and it puts out much more light than its predecessor, the S95D , making an already excellent picture look even better. Based on what I saw, the Samsung S95F ($3,199.99 for 65 inches) is a stunner that I look forward to putting through more testing when I get a production-ready model into PC Labs. For now, the LG Evo G5 ($3,399.99 for 65 inches) is even brighter, adds Dolby Vision support, and has a more intuitive user interface, making it our Editors\u2019 Choice winner for premium OLED TVs. Design: Slim and Sleek, With a Separate Box for Ports The S95F's panel is almost completely bezel-less, framed by the edge of a metal band along the sides and top and only a narrow brushed metal strip along the bottom edge. Most of the TV\u2019s ports and electronics are located in a separate One Connect Box, making for a very thin panel. It's not quite paper-thin, however, as the TV itself houses a 70W, 4.2.2-channel sound system. That\u2019s more advanced than the stereo sound most TVs offer and even bests the LG Evo G5\u2019s 4.2-channel system, which lacks height channels. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The One Connect Box drives the S95F by sending all of its power and signal information through a single five-foot cable (if you need a longer reach, Samsung offers 16- and 48-foot cables for $220 and $300, respectively). This lets you place the box some distance from the screen and connect all your devices to it, leaving the screen itself almost completely free of wires. The box can also be mounted behind the TV on the included metal table stand if you prefer. The plain black plastic slab measures 13 by 14.2 by 1.3 inches (HWD), and has four HDMI ports (one eARC), three USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector. (Credit: Will Greenwald) Samsung includes the same SolarCell Remote that comes with its other flagship TVs. It\u2019s a slim, rectangular, matte black wand with a large circular navigation pad near the top, a pinhole microphone, volume and channel rockers, and dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Samsung TV Plus, and YouTube. Frustratingly, there are no input buttons for quickly switching sources. It has a solar cell on the back and a USB-C port on the bottom for charging its built-in rechargeable battery, so you don\u2019t have to deal with AAs. Software: Tizen OS Gets Slightly Better As always, Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS smart TV platform is loaded with features but slightly frustrating due to its overbearing tendency to over-automate certain tasks and bury menus a layer or two deeper than most other interfaces. It\u2019s inching forward a little, though, and now lets you easily access settings by just pressing the gear button on the remote instead of having to press the gear button and then manually navigate through a long list to get to that menu. (Credit: Will Greenwald) All major streaming services , including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Crunchyroll, Disney+, Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube, are available on Tizen OS. Apple AirPlay and Miracast/WiDi are also supported, so you can stream directly from your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC. Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant is also built into the TV, and you can access it hands-free via the S95F\u2019s far-field microphone. Picture Quality: Bright, Colorful, and Gorgeous The S95F is a 4K OLED TV with a 120Hz refresh rate. It supports high dynamic range ( HDR ) content in HDR10, HDR10+, and hybrid log gamma (HLG), but Samsung continues to leave Dolby Vision out of its TVs. It has an ATSC 1.0 tuner for over-the-air broadcasts, but not ATSC 3.0 . Recommended by Our Editors PCMag Editorial Team Business Choice 2025: The Top VoIP Provider According to Our Readers Reflections on Microsoft's 50th: What Will It Take to Make It to 2075? I test TVs with a Klein K-10A colorimeter , a Murideo SIX-G signal generator , and Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman software , and I was impressed by the S95F\u2019s performance. The biggest weakness of OLED TVs (besides the high price) is brightness, and they are almost universally less bright than high-end LED TVs, with some models looking outright dim. In HDR Movie mode, the S95F shows a modest peak brightness of 336 nits with a full-screen white field but an impressive 1,364 nits with an 18% white field. Moving to a 10% field, that number increases to a blazing 2,007 nits. I compare 18% white field measurements between TVs to be consistent across different types, but that 10% field brightness is excellent, especially with perfect black levels and no light bloom whatsoever thanks to the pixel-level dimming OLED technology enables. It\u2019s far brighter than the S95D (1,060 nits 18%, 1,613 nits 10%), though not quite the brightest OLED I\u2019ve tested. That designation belongs to the LG Evo G5, which is downright stunning at 1,608 nits with an 18% white field and 2,386 nits with a 10% white field. Mini-LED TVs are still far brighter than OLEDs, and the Samsung QN90F has a peak brightness of 2,259 nits with an 18% field and technically perfect black levels, but light bloom is a factor. (Credit: PCMag) Color is almost always a strong suit of OLEDs, and the S95F is definitely proof of that. The above charts show the TV\u2019s color levels in Movie mode with an SDR signal compared against Rec.709 broadcast standards and with an HDR signal compared against DCI-P3 digital cinema standards, and in both cases, colors are largely accurate and free of any tinting. Whites lean just a little bit toward magenta but are still fairly close, and with an HDR signal, colors actually manage to exceed the DCI-P3 color space. The performance is very similar to the LG Evo G5, though the G5's whites are much more accurate and its magentas are a bit warm. The Great Gatsby demonstrates the strong contrast the S95F is capable of. Black suits in the party scenes show plenty of detail, like cuts, contours, and textures, while staying very dark. The whites of shirts and balloons look bright, while skin tones appear natural. Demonstration footage on the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD benchmark disc really lets the S95F show off its excellent picture quality. A timelapse scene of a landscape from before dawn to midday transitions smoothly, starting very dark and brightening considerably. Snowy shots retain lots of highlight details, making wisps of clouds and falling snowflakes visible against white skies and snow-covered ground. Colorful objects against completely black backgrounds are bright and vivid. The backgrounds remain perfectly black without any light bloom. Gaming Performance: Up to 165Hz and Responsive Gamers will be pleased by the S95F, which has a 120Hz panel that supports up to 165Hz variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It\u2019s very responsive, too. Using a Leo Bodnar 4K Video Signal Tester , I measured an input lag of 9.6 milliseconds with a 4K60 signal and 4.8ms with a 1080p120 signal on the S95F. That\u2019s below the one-frame threshold (16.6ms for 60Hz, 8.3ms for 120Hz) we consider best for gaming .

Major spoilers ahead for Severance \u2019s second season, so if you\u2019re not caught up, be sure to stream episodes with your Apple TV+ subscription . The second season of Severance has come to an end on the 2025 TV schedule , and while I will certainly be thinking about Gemma in that heartbreaking final scene until Severance Season 3 premieres, there\u2019s another Lumon employee who I can\u2019t get off of my mind: Dylan. Zach Cherry's character was developed so much this season, which became especially apparent when I revisited the series premiere. Knowing everything we do now, there\u2019s one joke in \u201cGood News About Hell\u201d that\u2019s taken on a whole new meaning. Severance Season 1: It was a simpler time. After enduring the literal torture of \u201cChikhai Bardo\u201d and everything that followed in Season 2, I was craving the blissful ignorance of finger traps and the coveted-as-fuck egg bar. It healed my soul to hear Irving quip, \u201cHi, kids. What\u2019s for dinner?\u201d However, where Dylan\u2019s smart-ass response would normally have elicited a chuckle, now the question he asks forces my brain down a Dylan rabbit hole. (Image credit: Apple TV+) Dylan\u2019s Sarcastic Takedown Has Deeper Meaning After Learning More About His Outie In Season 2 The first time we meet Lumon\u2019s MDR employees, we immediately get a sense of both their individual personalities and their rapport with each other. Like in many workplaces, the macrodats operate like something of a dysfunctional family, and it\u2019s pretty funny to see that the greeting from Irving ( John Turturro ) has irked his colleagues, particularly Zach Cherry\u2019s Dylan, for a while. Mark ( Adam Scott ) points out how confusing the \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d question is, asking Irving, \u201cLike, did the kids make you dinner in this scenario?\u201d Which prompts Dylan to chime in with: Yeah. What kind of a shit dad are you? Now back in 2022, that was just a dumb joke, and Dylan taking Irving\u2019s dinner question so literally just spoke to the simple humor of the unworldly innies. But that was before we knew more about Dylan\u2019s outie and the kind of dad he is. (Image credit: Apple TV+) It Turns Out Outie Dylan\u2019s Fathering Skills Might Be Less-Than-Ideal Not only do we find out later in Season 1 that Dylan is the only one of the macrodats with children (other than Petey, who is no longer with Lumon by the start of the series), we find out that \u2014 to put it bluntly \u2014 he\u2019s kind of a shit dad. CINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Maybe that\u2019s being too harsh. We definitely don\u2019t see Dylan treating his three children terribly or really even neglecting them, but we don\u2019t see him playing with them or interacting with them either. It\u2019s more that his general lack of motivation feels all-encompassing, and I think his watching TV and forgetting to bake the store-bought cookie dough is meant to speak more to his overall contribution to his and Gretchen\u2019s home life. So while Gretchen (Merritt Wever) graciously says that her husband \u201cnever quite found his thing,\u201d we know that innie Dylan has a higher standard for his outie and would no doubt stand by his questions about his other half being \u201cdumb,\u201d \u201ca dick,\u201d and/or \u201ckind of a fuck-up.\u201d (Image credit: Apple TV+) Everything Changed For Innie Dylan When He Learned He Had Children On The Outside However, back in Season 1, we didn\u2019t know this about Dylan. While his outie was struggling to find satisfaction in his life away from Lumon, we only knew of his innie, who was thriving down on the severed floor. He didn\u2019t know life could have a bigger purpose until Milchick (Tramell Tillman) activated the Overtime Contingency to find the card Dylan had stolen from O&D. Waking up in his outie\u2019s closet and having his son run in to hug him changed absolutely everything innie Dylan knew about his existence, and it was immediately obvious how important being a dad was to him. Perks like the Music Dance Experience no longer had meaning. He didn\u2019t want a waffle party; he wanted to remember his kids being born! He all of a sudden has something to fight for. That moment was the beginning of the whole Macrodat Uprising, which changed all of the innies\u2019 lives forever, and I think not only was that passion to be a good dad in Dylan\u2019s innie all along, I think he helped rekindle it in his outie. (Image credit: Apple TV+) I Think Innie Dylan Got His Outie To Stop Taking His Family For Granted There\u2019s been lots of discussion from the characters, the writers and the fans of Severance about how much of an innie\u2019s personality bleeds through from the outside. What personality traits can\u2019t be erased by bifurcating your brain? I think that shot fired at Irving in Season 1, Episode 1 was a big clue into how Dylan operates. Joking or not, innie Dylan\u2019s first thought when Irving asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d was to wonder about the welfare of his colleague\u2019s theoretical children. His innie acted like a dad before any of us (even him) knew he was one. Even in Season 2, while everyone was perplexed by the fact that Ms. Huang was a child , Dylan was the only one who asked if she needed help, saying in \u201cWho Is Alive?\u201d: I don't mean to impugn. It's just like, are you OK, you know? They're not, like, forcing you to be here, are they? Dylan\u2019s innie had a painful end to the season. He fell in love with Gretchen and then got dumped for his own loser outie. However, in doing that, it sounds like the \u201caffair\u201d was the wakeup call outie Dylan needed. The anguished cry of, \u201cGretchen!\u201d will never stop ringing in my ears, but it probably was the happiest ending we could have hoped for from this bizarre love triangle. Despite what he said, innie Dylan couldn\u2019t provide for Gretchen, but he did inspire his outie to be a better husband and, in turn, a better father. Apple TV Plus: 7-Day Free Trial Getting a free trial of Apple's streaming service is so much easier than having brain surgery in your basement. Enjoy the first two seasons of Severance , as new customers can stream Apple TV Plus for free for a whole week before paying $9.99 a month. In that time, you can also watch Ted Lasso, Slow Horses or just rewatch Severance again . View Deal That crack about Irving\u2019s presumably nonexistent children was just the first of many hilarious insults hurled good-naturedly at Dylan\u2019s MDR brethren, and I think it\u2019s pretty crazy that even when we knew so little about what was happening inside or outside of Lumon that these characters\u2019 complexities were already being formed. That said, I don\u2019t know if Dylan joking about Irving being a \u201cshit dad\u201d was an intentional clue into the innie\u2019s conscience or his outie\u2019s guilt, but given it was one of the first things we heard from Zach Cherry\u2019s character, it definitely feels more loaded after seeing him grow so much over two seasons. After the Severance Season 2 finale, I have no idea where Ben Stiller , Dan Erickson, and their new showrunners and writers will go next with one of the best shows on Apple TV+ , but I hope they continue to develop such well-rounded stories for these complex characters.

PCMag UK Review Home Entertainment TVs Samsung 65-Inch The Frame Pro (LS03FW) Samsung 65-Inch The Frame Pro The iconic digital picture frame TV goes wireless By Will Greenwald Apr 14, 2025 (Credit: Rene Magritte, Will Greenwald) Bottom Line Samsung's The Frame Pro is a stunning way to display digital art, but it's not the best TV for watching video. 14 Apr 2025 Pros Matte screen minimizes glare Excellent color performance Frame-like design with customizable bezels Wireless One Connect Box reduces cord clutter Cons Mediocre contrast Poor black levels Expensive Too much lag for gaming Samsung 65-Inch The Frame Pro (LS03FW) Specs AMD FreeSync FreeSync Premium Pro Black Level 0.06 Contrast Ratio 16,367:1 HDMI Ports 4 HDR HDR-10 Input Lag (1080p120) 36.2 Nvidia G-Sync None Panel Type LED Refresh Rate 120 Resolution 3,840 by 2,160 Screen Brightness 982 Screen Size 65 Streaming Services Yes Video Inputs HDMI Video Inputs RF Video Inputs USB VRR All Specs Digital picture frames and TVs are two very different beasts. Digital picture frames should make art and photos seem like printed images, while TVs should make movies and shows look realistic, like you\u2019re watching the story unfold through a window rather than a screen. Samsung\u2019s wireless The Frame Pro TV tries to have it both ways. Featuring frame-like customizable bezels, a matte screen treatment, and a separate wireless connection box for clutter-free wall-mounting, it indeed excels as a large digital picture frame. Unfortunately, like the non-Pro model we reviewed in 2022 , its very limited contrast makes it less than ideal as a TV, especially considering its hefty price (starting at $2,199.99 for 65 inches). The Frame Pro is a great digital picture frame if you\u2019re willing to drop the cash, but if you want a great TV, you can save a bundle with the Editors\u2019 Choice-winning Hisense U8N ($1,149.99 for 65 inches) and enjoy a much brighter picture with higher contrast. Design: Frame Is in the Name The Frame Pro is designed to look like a framed picture. This effect comes from flat bezels surrounding the screen, a big departure from the mostly bezel-free designs of most high-end TVs. The bezels are attached by magnets and removable. Samsung includes a staid flat black set with the TV, and white and wood-textured bezels are available for purchase separately. (Credit: Will Greenwald) This TV is designed to be hung and comes with a flush wall mount instead of a table stand. If you want to put it on a table or the floor, you\u2019ll need to buy a stand separately. The big difference between The Frame Pro and the less expensive The Frame is that the Pro version is almost completely wireless. It offloads most of its electronics and ports to a separate Wireless One Connect box that wirelessly streams audio and video to the TV. It still requires a cord for power, but a single cable is easier to hide than a nest of devices and cords. The Wireless One Connect Box is a plain black plastic slab with four HDMI ports (one eARC), two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The Frame Pro further emphasizes its concept with a matte coating that gives the screen a printed picture quality. It looks very nice, almost completely reducing glare from all ambient light and really making static pictures look like physical paintings or photos instead of images on a display. Some of the best standalone digital picture frames we've tested, like the Aura Mason ($199), also have a matte screen finish. The TCL NXTFrame ($1,999.99 for 65 inches) is another matte-finish TV that doubles as a digital photo frame, though out of the two, Samsung's The Frame Pro provides the more natural-looking picture. The included remote is a simple white rectangular wand with a circular navigation pad near the top and a pinhole microphone above it, plus volume and channel rockers and dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Samsung TV Plus, and YouTube. It isn\u2019t a rechargeable, solar-panel-equipped SolarCell remote like the one Samsung includes with the QN90F , QN990F , and S95F , so you\u2019ll have to deal with batteries. Software: Tizen OS, With an Art Store Samsung\u2019s smart TV platform is its own Tizen OS, which remains feature-packed and slightly frustrating. It supports all major streaming services , including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Crunchyroll, Disney+, Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube, plus Apple AirPlay and Miracast/WiDi for local streaming from iPhones, iPads, Macs, and PCs. It also has Amazon Alexa and you can summon the virtual assistant hands-free via the TV's far-field microphones. (Credit: Will Greenwald) Many settings feel like they\u2019re buried one or two menu layers deeper than on other interfaces, and the TV spends way too long trying to identify HDMI devices you plug in. It\u2019s gotten a bit better, though, as you can now simply press the gear button on the remote to access a quick settings menu instead of having to navigate through several options before getting to those controls. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The Samsung Art Store is available through Tizen OS on The Frame Pro. With a subscription, priced at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, you can access thousands of paintings and photos that look great on The Frame Pro. It's a convenient way to regularly refresh the look of your space, but you can find even more artwork from various museum and archive sites like the National Gallery of Art in high resolution for free. If you go that route, you need to load the artwork on a USB drive to show it on the screen. Recommended by Our Editors The Best TVs for 2025 Grade Your TV, Home Audio, and Streaming Options to Win Big The Best Gaming TVs for 2025 Performance: Pretty as a Picture The Samsung The Frame Pro is a 4K QLED TV with a 120Hz refresh rate. It supports high dynamic range ( HDR ) content in HDR10, HDR10+, and hybrid log gamma (HLG), but not Dolby Vision. It has an ATSC 1.0 tuner for over-the-air broadcasts, but not ATSC 3.0 for 1080p and 4K broadcasts. I test TVs with a Klein K-10A colorimeter , a Murideo SIX-G signal generator , and Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman software . As an LED-lit TV with no local dimming, The Frame Pro has only modest contrast. In HDR Filmmaker mode, it shows a peak brightness of 718 nits with a full-screen white field and 982 nits with an 18% white field, with a black level of 0.06cd/m^2 for a contrast ratio of 16,367:1. Reaching almost 1,000 nits is a good showing for a midrange TV, and it\u2019s much brighter than the 2022 The Frame (476 nits 18%, 0.1cd/m^2 black level, 4,757:1 contrast ratio), but it\u2019s blown out of the water by mini-LED TVs like the Samsung QN90F (2,259 nits with effectively perfectly dark blacks but some light bloom) and even OLED TVs like the Samsung S95F (1,363 nits at 18% with perfectly dark blacks and no light bloom) and the LG Evo G5 (1,608 nits at 18%, again with perfect blacks). (Credit: PCMag) Color on The Frame Pro, on the other hand, is hardly disappointing. The above charts show the TV\u2019s measured color levels in Movie mode with an SDR signal compared against Rec.709 broadcast standards and with an HDR signal compared against DCI-P3 digital cinema standards. Whites are perfect in both cases, and while magentas are just a touch warm, nearly all colors are almost completely free of any sort of tint. It doesn\u2019t cover the full DCI-P3 color space, but it comes very close while offering excellent color accuracy across the board. The Frame Pro simply doesn\u2019t have a mind-blowing picture, and that\u2019s evident when watching movies on it. The lack of local dimming is a particular weakness, as seen in the party scenes of The Great Gatsby . Black suits show varying levels of darkness depending on how much white is in the frame. In darker frames, suits appear properly black, but when a lot of white elements like shirts, balloons, and lights are also in the shot, they appear washed out. Colors are strong, at least, with accurate skin tones and flourishes like orange feathers and blue water popping nicely. Demonstration footage on the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD benchmark disc looks good, though not lifelike. The limited contrast, vibrant color, and matte finish on The Frame Pro gives landscape shots a nice impression of framed photographs. It\u2019s an appealing look, but it\u2019s not exactly the realistic view you would get from a brighter TV with higher contrast, like the QN90F, S95F, or LG Evo G5. While it isn\u2019t super-bright and lacks local dimming, The Frame Pro can at least preserve highlight and shadow details well. In snowy scenes, wisps of clouds and falling snowflakes can be discerned against white backgrounds, and shadowy trees in sunset landscape shots show plenty of detail, even if they appear washed out. Colorful objects look vivid against black backgrounds, with no light bloom. That said, you'll get much deeper blacks from a mini-LED TV like the QN90F with minimal light bloom (the result of local dimming) or from an OLED TV like the S95F or the LG G5 with no light bloom. (Credit: Hieronymus Bosch, Will Greenwald) The Frame Pro is far from ideal for watching video, but it excels as a digital picture frame. I looked closely at several works of art by Hieronyous Bosch and Rene Magritte through the Samsung Art Store, and I was taken by the detail and realism. They looked like well-lit versions of the actual paintings, and while I haven\u2019t seen any Bosch firsthand, I will say Magritte\u2019s \u201cThe Menaced Assassin\u201d on The Frame Pro is a spitting image of the actual work at the MoMA. Photos also look excellent, evoking a picture in a frame instead of a glowing TV. Gaming: Wireless Connectivity Holds It Back A 144Hz refresh rate makes The Frame Pro attractive for gaming on paper, but the Wireless One Connect Box holds it back in this regard. Using a Leo Bodnar 4K Video Signal Lag Tester , I measured an input lag of 21.2 milliseconds with a 1080p120 signal and 36.2ms with a 4K60 signal, with Game Optimizer (Samsung\u2019s Game mode) enabled. We consider one frame of latency (16.6ms for 4K60, 8.3ms for 1080p120) or less best for gaming , and The Frame Pro lags nearly three frames in both cases. That\u2019s a very high lag, only rivaled among TVs I\u2019ve tested by the QN990F (24.1ms at 1080p120, 37.1ms at 4K60). The common feature of both TVs is the use of the Wireless One Connect Box, so I have to conclude that a wireless video connection simply adds too much latency to make a TV very suitable for video games.

PCMag UK Review Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV Samsung's flagship OLED is bright and stunning By Will Greenwald Apr 14, 2025 Bottom Line The Samsung S95F is its brightest OLED TV yet, with terrific picture quality and a surprisingly capable built-in speaker system. 14 Apr 2025 Pros Very bright OLED panel Excellent color performance 4.2.2-channel speaker system One Connect Box aids in cable management Cons Expensive No ATSC 3.0 or Dolby Vision Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV Specs AMD FreeSync FreeSync Premium Pro Contrast Ratio Infinite HDMI Ports 4 HDR HDR-10 Input Lag (1080p120) 9.6 Nvidia G-Sync None Panel Type OLED Refresh Rate 120 Resolution 3,840 by 2,160 Screen Brightness 1364 Screen Size 65 Streaming Services Yes Video Inputs HDMI Video Inputs RF Video Inputs USB VRR All Specs OLED TVs keep getting brighter, and Samsung\u2019s S95F continues the trend. I tested a preproduction model of the company's flagship OLED at its QA lab, and it puts out much more light than its predecessor, the S95D , making an already excellent picture look even better. Based on what I saw, the Samsung S95F ($3,199.99 for 65 inches) is a stunner that I look forward to putting through more testing when I get a production-ready model into PC Labs. For now, the LG Evo G5 ($3,399.99 for 65 inches) is even brighter, adds Dolby Vision support, and has a more intuitive user interface, making it our Editors\u2019 Choice winner for premium OLED TVs. Design: Slim and Sleek, With a Separate Box for Ports The S95F's panel is almost completely bezel-less, framed by the edge of a metal band along the sides and top and only a narrow brushed metal strip along the bottom edge. Most of the TV\u2019s ports and electronics are located in a separate One Connect Box, making for a very thin panel. It's not quite paper-thin, however, as the TV itself houses a 70W, 4.2.2-channel sound system. That\u2019s more advanced than the stereo sound most TVs offer and even bests the LG Evo G5\u2019s 4.2-channel system, which lacks height channels. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The One Connect Box drives the S95F by sending all of its power and signal information through a single five-foot cable (if you need a longer reach, Samsung offers 16- and 48-foot cables for $220 and $300, respectively). This lets you place the box some distance from the screen and connect all your devices to it, leaving the screen itself almost completely free of wires. The box can also be mounted behind the TV on the included metal table stand if you prefer. The plain black plastic slab measures 13 by 14.2 by 1.3 inches (HWD), and has four HDMI ports (one eARC), three USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector. (Credit: Will Greenwald) Samsung includes the same SolarCell Remote that comes with its other flagship TVs. It\u2019s a slim, rectangular, matte black wand with a large circular navigation pad near the top, a pinhole microphone, volume and channel rockers, and dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Samsung TV Plus, and YouTube. Frustratingly, there are no input buttons for quickly switching sources.

Recommended by Our Editors PCMag Editorial Team Business Choice 2025: The Top VoIP Provider According to Our Readers Reflections on Microsoft's 50th: What Will It Take to Make It to 2075? I test TVs with a Klein K-10A colorimeter , a Murideo SIX-G signal generator , and Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman software , and I was impressed by the S95F\u2019s performance. The biggest weakness of OLED TVs (besides the high price) is brightness, and they are almost universally less bright than high-end LED TVs, with some models looking outright dim. In HDR Movie mode, the S95F shows a modest peak brightness of 336 nits with a full-screen white field but an impressive 1,364 nits with an 18% white field. Moving to a 10% field, that number increases to a blazing 2,007 nits. I compare 18% white field measurements between TVs to be consistent across different types, but that 10% field brightness is excellent, especially with perfect black levels and no light bloom whatsoever thanks to the pixel-level dimming OLED technology enables. It\u2019s far brighter than the S95D (1,060 nits 18%, 1,613 nits 10%), though not quite the brightest OLED I\u2019ve tested. That designation belongs to the LG Evo G5, which is downright stunning at 1,608 nits with an 18% white field and 2,386 nits with a 10% white field. Mini-LED TVs are still far brighter than OLEDs, and the Samsung QN90F has a peak brightness of 2,259 nits with an 18% field and technically perfect black levels, but light bloom is a factor. (Credit: PCMag) Color is almost always a strong suit of OLEDs, and the S95F is definitely proof of that. The above charts show the TV\u2019s color levels in Movie mode with an SDR signal compared against Rec.709 broadcast standards and with an HDR signal compared against DCI-P3 digital cinema standards, and in both cases, colors are largely accurate and free of any tinting. Whites lean just a little bit toward magenta but are still fairly close, and with an HDR signal, colors actually manage to exceed the DCI-P3 color space. The performance is very similar to the LG Evo G5, though the G5's whites are much more accurate and its magentas are a bit warm. The Great Gatsby demonstrates the strong contrast the S95F is capable of. Black suits in the party scenes show plenty of detail, like cuts, contours, and textures, while staying very dark. The whites of shirts and balloons look bright, while skin tones appear natural. Demonstration footage on the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD benchmark disc really lets the S95F show off its excellent picture quality. A timelapse scene of a landscape from before dawn to midday transitions smoothly, starting very dark and brightening considerably. Snowy shots retain lots of highlight details, making wisps of clouds and falling snowflakes visible against white skies and snow-covered ground. Colorful objects against completely black backgrounds are bright and vivid. The backgrounds remain perfectly black without any light bloom. Gaming Performance: Up to 165Hz and Responsive Gamers will be pleased by the S95F, which has a 120Hz panel that supports up to 165Hz variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It\u2019s very responsive, too. Using a Leo Bodnar 4K Video Signal Tester , I measured an input lag of 9.6 milliseconds with a 4K60 signal and 4.8ms with a 1080p120 signal on the S95F. That\u2019s below the one-frame threshold (16.6ms for 60Hz, 8.3ms for 120Hz) we consider best for gaming .

(Credit: Will Greenwald) The Bottom Line The Samsung S95F is its brightest OLED TV yet, with terrific picture quality and a surprisingly capable built-in speaker system. Pros & Cons Very bright OLED panel Excellent color performance 4.2.2-channel speaker system One Connect Box aids in cable management Expensive No ATSC 3.0 or Dolby Vision Specs & Configurations Name Value Panel Type OLED Screen Size 65 inches Resolution 3,840 by 2,160 Video Inputs HDMI, USB, RF HDR HDR-10 HDMI Ports 4 Streaming Services Yes Screen Brightness 1364 nits Contrast Ratio Infinite Refresh Rate 120 Hz VRR Input Lag (1080p120) 9.6 ms AMD FreeSync FreeSync Premium Pro Nvidia G-Sync None More Specs EDITORS' NOTE My findings here are based on testing I performed on a preproduction version of S95F at Samsung's lab. I will hold off on giving it a formal score until I test the finalized version. OLED TVs keep getting brighter, and Samsung\u2019s S95F continues the trend. I tested a preproduction model of the company's flagship OLED at its QA lab, and it puts out much more light than its predecessor, the S95D , making an already excellent picture look even better. Based on what I saw, the Samsung S95F ($3,199.99 for 65 inches) is a stunner that I look forward to putting through more testing when I get a production-ready model into PC Labs. For now, the LG Evo G5 ($3,399.99 for 65 inches) is even brighter, adds Dolby Vision support, and has a more intuitive user interface, making it our Editors\u2019 Choice winner for premium OLED TVs. Design: Slim and Sleek, With a Separate Box for Ports The S95F's panel is almost completely bezel-less, framed by the edge of a metal band along the sides and top and only a narrow brushed metal strip along the bottom edge. Most of the TV\u2019s ports and electronics are located in a separate One Connect Box, making for a very thin panel. It's not quite paper-thin, however, as the TV itself houses a 70W, 4.2.2-channel sound system. That\u2019s more advanced than the stereo sound most TVs offer and even bests the LG Evo G5\u2019s 4.2-channel system, which lacks height channels. (Credit: Will Greenwald) The One Connect Box drives the S95F by sending all of its power and signal information through a single five-foot cable (if you need a longer reach, Samsung offers 16- and 48-foot cables for $220 and $300, respectively). This lets you place the box some distance from the screen and connect all your devices to it, leaving the screen itself almost completely free of wires. The box can also be mounted behind the TV on the included metal table stand if you prefer. The plain black plastic slab measures 13 by 14.2 by 1.3 inches (HWD), and has four HDMI ports (one eARC), three USB-A ports, a 3.5mm RS-232C port, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, and an antenna/cable connector.

Final Thoughts (Credit: Will Greenwald) Samsung 65-Inch S95F OLED TV Based on my tests of a preproduction model, the Samsung S95F is a fantastic OLED TV that looks great and puts out far more light than its predecessor. I also appreciate its advanced speaker system, fast gaming performance, and streamlined design with the One Connect box for minimal cable clutter. I won\u2019t give the Samsung S95F a formal score until I can test a finalized unit in the PC Lab, so stay tuned. In the meantime, the LG Evo G5 remains our Editors' Choice winner for OLED TVs. Though slightly more expensive than the S95F, it gets even brighter and has Dolby Vision.

These recipes are rewards for completing quests around New Avalon, opposed to being randomized drops like the Scarlet disguise recipes , and yield endgame level items that are useful in a pinch or as long-term staples. There are a few that stand out as items you should try to get whether by crafting it yourself, getting a friend make these items for you or, if you have obscene amounts of gold, just buying them on the Auction House (though this option is very expensive). If you want to try and get the actual recipes yourself, you should have a full Scarlet disguise ready and equipped just to make your life easier because New Avalon is a deadly place. Once you\u2019re ready, where and how to get these profession recipes in New Avalon. Tailoring Tailors can pick up two new bags as rewards from quests given by the New Avalon Leatherworking supplies vendor Taylor Stitchings at coordinates (94, 83) near the apple orchard: Complete the quest Holy Threads to unlock the pattern for the 24-slot Crusader\u2019s Knapsack Requires 250 Tailoring The quest Red Is Not Dead gives players the pattern for the 30-slot Crimson Dawnwoven Bag Requires 290 Tailoring Engineering Way out near the Radiant Forge behind a set of fake trees is a goblin named Fizzlefuse (62, 24) who has a handful of Engineering quests: Nondisclosure Argument rewards players with the schematic for Pop-Up Shrub s, which creates an emergency hiding area that prevents you from being attacked by most enemies.

This item starts a quest where you need to go to Carrie Hearthfire at the New Avalon inn (95, 78) for turn in. Carrie will then give you the quest The Great Feast which asks you to get different types of food ingredients. Completing the quest rewards you with Carrie\u2019s Cookbook , an item that teaches two new feast recipes ( Grand Lobster Banquet and Specklefin Feast ) that benefits solo players and raid groups alike.

Holding a 19% market share, Apple outpaced Samsung \u2014 despite the fact that Samsung ships low- and mid-range phones, unlike Apple \u2014 with 18%, even in the face of stagnant or falling sales in the U.S., Europe, and China. Strong iPhone demand persists in emerging markets, though competition from Huawei and absent AI features weakened sales in China. Counterpoint predicts a market decline this year due to tariff uncertainties, with Xiaomi maintaining third place, followed by Vivo in fourth and OPPO in fifth.

With a strategic push into emerging markets and a rare off-cycle product launch, the tech giant surged past Samsung in Q1 2025 \u2014 a shift in the high-stakes battle for mobile dominance. Apple sales grew during the period, while those of its chief rival Samsung dropped. Apple beats all smartphone rivals in Q1 2025 Apple and Samsung battle for supremacy in smartphone sales. But it\u2019s a tight race \u2014 the two are usually within a few percentage points of each other. In Q1 2025, iPhone came out on top. Apple made up 19% of the global phone market in Q1 2025 , reports Counterpoint Research. It held that place thanks to a 4% year-over-year increase in sales. \u201cHelped by the iPhone 16e launch in a non-traditional quarter and continued growth and expansion in its non-core markets, Apple took the #1 spot in Q1 2025, despite the challenges faced in its biggest markets,\u201d said Counterpoint\u2019s analysts. \u201cWhile sales in the US, Europe and China were either flat or declining, Apple recorded double-digit growth in Japan, India, Middle East and Africa, and Southeast Asia.\u201d While this is the first Q1 in which iPhone held the top spot in sales, it led the world in shipments both during the fourth quarter of 2024 and for that whole year . Samsung\u2019s Androids previously led the pack during Q1 in previous years, but Counterpoint says a 5% year-over-year slump in sales made that impossible in 2025. That gave the Korean company 18% of the global market, according to Counterpoint. A contrary opinion No company reveals how many smartphones it makes, so it\u2019s up to analysts to estimate the figures. And they don\u2019t often agree. Case in point: rival market analysis firm IDC also released on Monday its estimates for the Q1 2025 global smartphone market, and they put Samsung at the top. According to this source, Apple shipped 57.9 million units iPhones quarter, a 10% year-over-year increase. That put it at 19% of the Q1 2025 smartphone market. And IDC reports Samsung shipped 60.6 million Androids in the first three months of the year for 19.9% of the market. Both analysts companies agree that Chinese brands made up the rest of the top five. Xiaomi held 14% of the global market, while Vivo and Oppo each had 8%, according to Counterpoint. Looking ahead Counterpoint Research analysts are not optimistic about the global smartphone market during the rest of 2025. \u201cSmartphones being an essential product will always have a steady sales graph, but economic uncertainties can make consumers postpone their purchases and thus, the rise in trade risks and unsettling of the supply chain can negatively impact on the market going forward,\u201d they said on Monday. \u201cWhile our long-term outlook remains steady, we believe the market will show a decline in 2025.\u201d Number of comments on this post Leave a comment Newsletters Daily round-ups or a weekly refresher, straight from Cult of Mac to your inbox.

You chat with them on the way, knowing that your privacy isn\u2019t exactly sacrosanct in a stranger\u2019s car, but still comfortable enough to talk. After you get there, someone sends you a text message with a transcript of your entire conversation during the ride. Anvi Ahuja, a Lyft user in Toronto, doesn\u2019t have to imagine. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports that\u2019s exactly what happened to her. When she called the number that had texted her the transcript, she got a generic \u201cnot available\u201d recording allegedly from the Lyft service. Ahuja was, understandably, upset. After calling Lyft later that night, she was told that the company was piloting a program that recorded and transcribed conversations into a centralized database. But Lyft later adjusted its messaging, telling her in a follow-up message that it was the driver who specifically recorded her\u2014without consent\u2014and said that it was taking \u201cproper actions\u201d to rectify the situation. The shocking revelation here is not that a customer was recorded. (Indeed, I can\u2019t remember the last time I hopped into a ride-share or taxi without a dashcam that also had a camera pointed towards the car\u2019s interior.) While a single vehicle feels more private and intimate than a normal public place, the fact is, the driver is part of a business and it makes sense to record stuff purely for the sake of safety. But the transcription of words, especially if it appears to be coming from a centralized service somewhere within Lyft itself, is more concerning. \u201cThese ride-sharing apps are big companies and people have a lot of sensitive conversations within cabs and they feel like they\u2019re secure,\u201d Ahuja told the CBC. Lyft has confirmed to both the customer and the CBC that it is running a pilot program that records and transcribes conversations inside drivers\u2019 vehicles, but claims that those transcriptions are only \u201csupposed to be sent to the ride-sharing company for reference if a security issue is reported.\u201d According to Lyft, the system is based on the app Lyft drivers use while on the job. A Lyft representative claims that Ahuja\u2019s experience is not related to that program, which is only running in select US markets with opt-in protocols for drivers. Exactly how the driver, or anyone else, contacted Ahuja with the transcription isn\u2019t clear. Lyft drivers are able to communicate with customers via the app, but aren\u2019t supposed to have access to the customer\u2019s phone number, nor are customers supposed to have the numbers of their drivers. \u201cWe can confirm that the communication was sent via a masked number, and the driver did not have access to the rider\u2019s personal phone number,\u201d Lyft told the CBC. The company said it is investigating. How the person got Ahuja\u2019s number, got the transcript of her conversation, and called with an allegedly Lyft-associated number according to the recording Ahuja heard when she called back? None of that is known. In Canada, recording business patrons must be disclosed along with the purpose of those recordings, even in a nominally public place. It\u2019s typically achieved with some kind of signage. Ahuja claims this did not happen. Lyft\u2019s Canadian recording policy directs drivers to follow local regulations and says that Lyft \u201cdoesn\u2019t have direct access to the cameras, but we will know that you have a camera in the vehicle once you complete the registration.\u201d Author: Michael Crider , Staff Writer, PCWorld Michael is a 10-year veteran of technology journalism, covering everything from Apple to ZTE.

PREMIUM TIMES reported that the Ogun-born singer was apprehended concerning allegations involving Fuji star Saheed Osupa. The dispute arose after Osupa reported one of Portable\u2019s songs, \u2018Fuji Shakushaku\u2019, for copyright infringement, leading to its removal from Apple Music. Osupa also alleged that Portable defamed him in a live broadcast on Instagram on 19 March. In the video, Portable reportedly accused Osupa of sabotaging his music career. The 31-year-old singer was arraigned on multiple charges, including criminal defamation, cyberstalking, inciting public disturbance, and criminal intimidation on Monday. The court presiding over the case ordered that \u201cZaZoo Zehh Cronner\u201d be released on bail upon the provision of two sureties: one must be either the Chairman or Secretary of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN), and the other must own property within a Government Reserved Area (GRA) with a valid Certificate of Occupancy. Despite the court\u2019s ruling, Portable was remanded in custody after failing to meet the bail conditions as of press time.

The investigating police officer, Adeniyi James, an assistant superintendent of police, confirmed that Portable was charged based on directives from police authorities.

Some of the new emoji include a face with bags under its eyes and a splatter , but what do these new emoji -- and the thousands of others -- mean? A \"\ud83d\ude03\" or \"\u2764\ufe0f\" are easy to understand, but how are \"\ud83d\ude29\" and \"\ud83d\ude2d\" different, and what does it mean when someone sends you food emoji like \"\ud83c\udf46\" or \"\ud83c\udf51\"? Over time, emoji meanings have become subjective, depending on a message's context and wider cultural trends. That face says it all. Apple Which shaking smiley face should you use? Is there a difference between each different colored heart? Does the peach emoji actually mean fruit anymore? Here's how to figure out what all 3,790 emoji mean and what emoji could be next. Read more: We Could Get a Sasquatch Emoji Soon Emojipedia is here to help Emojipedia is an online encyclopedia of emoji managed by people who research emoji . The site sorts emoji into nine categories, including Smileys, People, Objects, Activity and more. Each category then breaks down emoji into further subsections. So if you click into Smileys, for example, you'll see sections like Smiling & Affectionate and Sleepy & Unwell . If you click an individual emoji, Emojipedia will give you a brief description of that emoji. For example, here's what Emojipedia writes about the \"\ud83d\udc45\" ( tongue ) emoji: \"A tongue, sticking out. May be used as a childish sign of defiance. Alternatively: licking, in various contexts.\" Emojipedia will also give you a list of other emoji that this particular emoji works well with. In the case of the face in clouds emoji, Emojipedia's suggestions include the \"\ud83e\udee0\" melting face and the \"\ud83e\udee6\" biting lip -- quite a range there. What's a text message without an emoji or two? Jason Cipriani/CNET Each Emojipedia entry also shows you the different artwork for each emoji across platforms, as well as how the artwork evolved. The emoji entry will also show you shortcodes and other names for each emoji, if applicable. What are the most popular emoji? You may have your own go-to emoji, but according to Emojipedia, these are the most popular emoji as of mid-April. The list changes periodically, so what's popular now might not be popular next month or around a holiday. Note that not all platforms support all the latest emoji, so they may not all appear on your device. \u2764\ufe0f Red heart \ud83e\udd0d White heart \ud83e\udd79 Face holding back tears \ud83e\udec2 People hugging \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb Heart hands: light skin tone \ud83d\udc97 Growing heart \ud83d\ude2d Loudly crying face \ud83c\udf80 Ribbon \u2728 Sparkles \ud83d\udc80 Skull What are the latest emoji? Emojipedia In September, Google unveiled Emoji 16.0 , which includes eight new emoji. Here are the new emoji. Face with bags under eyes Fingerprint Splatter Root vegetable Leafless tree Harp Shovel Flag of Sark How often are new emoji added? Anyone can submit an idea for a new emoji. The Unicode Standard -- a universal character encoding standard -- is responsible for creating new emoji. Unicode proposed nine new emoji in November, 2024, including a Sasquatch and an orca. However, those are just proposed emoji. Unicode will decide in September which emoji to add next. Emojipedia What about custom emoji, like Apple's Genmoji? Apple unveiled its emoji generator, Genmoji , at WWDC 2024, and the tech giant included the feature in iOS 18.2 . However, only people with an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max or a device from the iPhone 16 lineup can access Genmoji for now. If you can't use Genmoji and want to create your own custom emoji, Emojipedia is home to two custom emoji generators. Emojipedia First is Emojipedia's AI emoji generator . You can use this tool to create anything from a frog wearing a cowboy hat to a heart shaped pizza. You type your description of the emoji into the generator, and the tool will create an emoji based on your description. You can then download or copy your custom emoji to your clipboard and use it as a sticker across messaging apps like WhatsApp and iMessage. This emoji generator is free, but you can only generate three emoji per day so make sure you describe your emoji as much as possible so you don't waste one of your tries. If you do run out of AI emoji generations for the day, you can also use the Emoji Mashup Bot , which combines two emoji from the Twemoji set. You can use this as many times as you want, but you can only choose up to 113 emoji to combine and they are all smileys. That means you can't be as creative in your creation as you might be in the AI emoji generator. All this just for emoji? Yeah, but wait there's more! Emojipedia also hosts the World Emoji Awards on World Emoji Day, July 17. Awards are given for things like Most Popular New Emoji and Most Anticipated Emoji. Winners are determined by popular vote on X , formerly known as Twitter, and any emoji approved the year prior is eligible to win. New emoji are added every year, and there are even awards given out for new emoji. Emojipedia The winner for the Most Popular New Emoji in 2024 was the head shaking horizontally (\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f) followed by the head shaking vertically (\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f) and the phoenix (\ud83d\udc26\u200d\ud83d\udd25). The winner of the Most Anticipated Emoji went to the face with bags under its eyes and the Most 2024 Emoji award went to the melting face (\ud83e\udee0) for the second year in a row -- it still fits. The sparkles (\u2728) emoji was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2024. Emojipedia wrote that this emoji has been among the most popular emoji since 2015, and it's been adopted as the go-to image for AI. In 2023 , the most popular emoji was the pink heart emoji (\ud83e\ude77) and the runner-up was the shaking face (\ud83e\udee8). The most anticipated emoji award in 2023 went to the head shaking horizontally (\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f).

Its Blackwell AI chips have started production in Phoenix at Taiwan Semiconductor plants. The news comes after President Donald Trump imposed high reciprocal tariffs on a long list of countries. In this article NVDA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images Nvidia , the chipmaker that powers much of today's artificial intelligence boom, on Monday announced a push to produce NVIDIA AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. for the first time. The company said it plans to produce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the U.S. via its manufacturing partnerships over the next four years. \"Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency,\" CEO Jensen Huang said. The news comes after President Donald Trump , in a push to take on trade deficits and pressure companies to on-shore more manufacturing to the U.S., imposed high \"reciprocal\" tariffs on a long list of countries. Trump placed a 32% tariff on products from Taiwan, where Nvidia largely manufactures its graphics processing units, or GPUs, and 145% tariffs on products from China, a move that threatened to take a toll on tech giants like Apple , which makes iPhones and most of its other products in China. But things changed quickly: On Friday evening, Trump exempted chips , as well as smartphones , computers , and other tech devices and components, from the tariffs. On Sunday, he reportedly said he would announce tariffs on imported semiconductors within the week.

Its Blackwell AI chips have started production in Phoenix at Taiwan Semiconductor plants. In Arizona, Nvidia will also partner with Amkor and Siliconware Precision Industries, which provide chip packaging and testing services. The company designs its GPUs, but outsources its chip production to contract manufacturers like TSMC. Nvidia is also building manufacturing plants for its supercomputers in Texas, partnering with Foxconn in Houston and with Wistron in Dallas, the company wrote. It expects to reach mass production at both facilities within 12 to 15 months. To help design and operate the manufacturing plants, Nvidia will use its own technology to create \"digital twins\" of the factories and build robots for specialized automation. The White House put out a blog post on Monday calling Nvidia's announcement the \"Trump effect in action.\" When asked if there was a relationship between the announcement and Trump's tariffs, Nvidia declined to comment.

Apple Bristol in 2023 Apple Bristol will be closing its doors on Saturday, August 9, due to redevelopment plans at the Cabot Circus Shopping Centre, and the adjacent Bristol Shopping Quarter. According to news reports , and a building application , the owner of the property is planning to reconfigure the retail space along Philadelphia Street, where Apple is located. The plans call for a mix of residential buildings, medical facilities, restaurants, and more. Ahead of redevelopment, the shopping area has faced increasing vacancy rates. A few years ago, Cabot Circus lost a large movie theater. In a statement shared with MacRumors , Apple said employees impacted by the store closure will be able to continue their roles at the company. \"At Apple, we're always focused on providing an exceptional experience for all of our customers,\" said Apple. \"Due to the redevelopment plans at Cabot Circus Shopping Centre, which include the closure of the section where our store is located, Apple Bristol will close on August 9, 2025. We've loved serving the Bristol community for over 15 years, and our valued team members will continue their roles at Apple.\" Apple Bristol first opened in 2008, with the location formerly known as Apple Cabot Circus. The two-floor store still had a classic design that was due for a facelift. The lower level serves as a product sales area, while the upper level provides space for Genius Bar appointments and Today at Apple creative sessions. Apple Bristol in 2008 The company has two other stores in the surrounding areas, including Apple Cribbs Causeway on the outskirts of Bristol, and Apple SouthGate in Bath. Apple is also permanently closing its store at a dying mall in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook later this month, and it permanently closed its Infinite Loop and Royal Hawaiian stores last year. On the other hand, Apple continues to open new stores, including in Miami , the Los Angeles area, China, Spain, Malaysia, and soon in Downtown Detroit . Apple is also hiring for retail positions in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, after it announced plans to expand its retail presence in those countries last year.

While the automaker regularly releases smaller updates, it sometimes bundles many features into the same update for a bigger release, like this one. It\u2019s important to note that while it\u2019s a significant update as a whole, many of these features are specific to certain vehicles and regions. Therefore, most Tesla owners won\u2019t get most of those features. Adaptive Headlights Now Available in US and Canada This is something that has been available in Europe for a while, but now Tesla is introducing it in its latest vehicles in North America: Advertisement - scroll for more content High beams adapt to reduce glare for other drivers and cyclists. By detecting other road users, and selectively dimming individual pixels of the headlight, your high beams stay on more often for greater visibility at night. If your Tesla is equipped with the necessary hardware (matrix headlights), you\u2019ll now see the toggle under Controls > Lights > Adaptive Headlights . Blind Spot Camera Moves to Driver Screen (Model S/X) The headline is pretty self-explanatory, and it looks like this on your driver display: Controls > Display > Automatic Blind Spot Camera & select Driver Screen This is only for the refreshed Model S/X (2021-2025). Dashcam/Sentry Mode Upgrade: More Cameras, Better Viewer For newer Model S, 3, X, and Y vehicles, Tesla is now including side camera (B-pillar) footage in Dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings, increasing the total recorded camera angles from four to six. Alongside that, the Dashcam Viewer app has been redesigned with a grid layout and quick-swipe video review tools. This has been a highly requested feature by Tesla owners, especially more recently amid increased occurrences of vandalism against Tesla vehicles. Smarter Road Trips: Alternative Trip Plans Tesla\u2019s Trip Planner has become more useful with now clearer choices for multiple routing styles: Fastest : minimize travel time Best Amenities : prioritize charging stops near top-rated restaurants, shops, and restrooms Fewer Stops : reduce the number of charging stops Top comment by KerrySkates Liked by 13 people Looks like a nothing burger for those of us with cars released before latest refreshed 3/Y. I\u2019m in a HW3 vehicle. The navigation updates are the most notable and actually useful feature. I would like to see an option for managing charging stop length. The \u201cfastest\u201d option might take that into account, but maybe I don\u2019t want any stops to take longer than 20 minutes. Still\u2026 the navigation updates here are great. The best update my Tesla could give me is the removal of the Elon Musk bug. That one has overstayed its welcome and is long overdue for being addressed. Here\u2019s hoping for a near-future update that solves that issue. View all comments Nearby attractions are also listed when viewing a Supercharger location. Cybertruck-Specific Updates The Cybertruck gains a pair of Autopilot-related upgrades: Comfort Drive Mode : now auto-engages when Autopilot is active Lane Departure Avoidance Assist : no longer just a warning\u2014now it can also gently steer to keep you in your lane When Tesla started delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, the software was far from completed, especially when it comes to Tesla\u2019s advanced driver assist features.

TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . Something to look forward to: Even though iPadOS is considered a great operating system for the tablet form factor, it still falls short in several areas compared to a full desktop OS. But that could change with the launch of iPadOS 19, which will reportedly see the slate's software more closely aligned with macOS. According to Bloomberg's expert on all things Apple-related, Mark Gurman, a key theme of Apple's upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is likely to be iPad software. Writing in his Power On newsletter , Gurman says that this year's iPadOS release will focus on productivity, multitasking, and window management. Many users have been calling for Apple to introduce new software that makes the iPad more powerful, especially in light of the new M3 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro that are now available. While power users have asked for Apple to simply put macOS on the iPad, that isn't going to happen. However, the changes that will arrive in iPadOS 19 are expected to make the tablet's operating system much more like its Mac sibling's OS. Gurman says that the changes will likely go far enough to make advocates for macOS-on-iPad happy, at least for the time being. // Related Stories Apple to launch iPad Pro M5 and MacBook Pro M5 this year, MacBook Air to follow in 2026 Apple WWDC kicks off June 9 with big software updates In March, Gurman said that the latest iPad Pro featuring Apple's M5 chip is set to land this year. Apple released the 2018 and 2022 iPad Pro models in October of those years, but the current OLED-sporting iPad Pros were launched in May 2024. WWDC is scheduled to take place from June 9 to June 13. Gurman said iPadOS 19 is coming about the same time that the M5 iPad Pros will be ready, so the upgraded OS could take full advantage of the power in Apple's next-gen silicon. It was reported last month that Apple wants to revamp the user interface across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices later this year. Cupertino wants to transform the look and feel of its iDevices, creating more consistency across all products. Everything from applications and icons to window styles could look the same on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and even visionOS. 3 comments 36 likes and shares Share this article: Featured on TechSpot Ubisoft argues players don't own their games Windows 11 is getting a revamped Start Menu Most Popular Atari 2600: The Atlantis of Game Consoles 22 comments Trump's tariffs force laptop makers like Dell and Lenovo to halt US shipments 66 comments Trump's dream of a US-made iPhone clashes with Apple's manufacturing reality 44 comments Sony stops making 8K TVs, but ultra high-def cameras remain key to future Load Comments 3 ...

Heidi Klum Promotes Season 21 of PROJECT RUNWAY in New York Posted on April 14, 2025 X Facebook Email Messenger Pinterest Reddit WhatsApp Pin Our Project Runway opinionating days are far in our rearview mirror, so we don\u2019t have much to say about the upcoming revival with Law Roach and a returning Heidi Klum. We wish everyone involved well, but y\u2019all did Tim Gunn dirty. Anyway, the one opinion we do have about the upcoming season is that it\u2019s never a bad idea to have Heidi as your host, because she is absolutely tireless about getting her face out there and promoting the show. She was pap\u2019d on the way to a taping, serving up the kind of street style we\u2019ve come to expect from her. Pin Pin Pin Pin Pin Matchy and highly photogenic. That\u2019s how your girl rolls when she\u2019s walking a sidewalk. We don\u2019t actually like the dress all that much,but the styling \u2013 specifically the coat and boots \u2013 do a lot to pull the look together and give it a little edge.

Explore Hand Tracking With Fishing Haven On Apple Vision Pro Skip to content VR Gaming Real VR Fishing Devs Explore Hand Tracking With Fishing Haven On Apple Vision Pro , & Ian Hamilton 14 April 2025 Share to Reddit Share to Facebook Share to WhatsApp The developers behind Real VR Fishing created an early access Fishing Haven on Apple Vision Pro. The new app from Devs United Games explores hand tracking mechanics for fishing in VR wherever you are, no controllers needed. It\u2019s extremely buggy at the time of writing, but still makes for an interesting exploration with plenty of room to grow. For instance, the app begins with multitasking in mixed reality or full VR. You can select where you want to fish while having other apps up. Once you select \u201cgo fishing\u201d you exit multitasking and transport to a cozy fishing spot with no other distractions. There are fishing holes across the United States, South Korea, and Japan, which you can unlock as you start reeling fish in. You can examine your rod, reel and tackle while in multitasking mode as well as check on which kinds of fish you have and haven\u2019t caught yet. Once you\u2019re at your fishing spot, just reach over and grab the rod and make a forceful casting gesture. When a fish strikes, reach over with your other hand and start reeling it in. 0:00 / 0:33 1\u00d7 Real VR Fishing on Quest headsets has long been one of the best multiplayer experiences, and the title also carries mostly positive reviews on Steam. With Fishing Haven on Vision Pro, the developers have a fresh start and it\u2019s certainly a delight to look over and see a map of all your fishing spots available. It takes just two taps in the open air to go fishing. We can\u2019t recommend buyers pick up this game just yet, given that it\u2019s early access and features so many bugs at present. That said, the developers have a track record of careful and methodical iterative design and we\u2019ll be watching with interest as they add new features and develop this title further.

Speaking on the Fox News talk show Monday morning, Doocy talked about another possible \u201cbumpy\u201d week for those involved with the stock market before mentioning \u201cMichelle,\u201d a family friend who understands \u201cwhat the president is trying to do.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to come back and we all hope that\u2019s true,\u201d Doocy said. Read the full exchange here: STEVE DOOCY: When the news broke yesterday there would be a carveout for smartphones and computers, Nvidia and Apple \u2014 suddenly the stock futures went up for them because that would be really good news for them. Hold on, there still is going to be tariff . It\u2019s very clear, if you are one of those people who watches the ticker at the bottom of the frame or you are thinking about your 401(k). But we have heard, to your point about Scott Bessent. We have heard him talk about the time frame. How long is it going to be bumpy? It\u2019s going to be bumpy this week. Another really bumpy week. But he has suggested in things he said last week. It sounds like it\u2019s going to be about 80, 90 days should be over by June. Early June is kind of what he said in one of those availabilities out in front of the White House. If people know it\u2019s only going to last until June and the market comes back. That would be good. My wife and I have a friend, Michelle, she is a widower and she has her life savings in a bank account, in the stock market. So far, she\u2019s lost 18% of her life savings. And so she is ready. She understands what the president is trying to do, rebalance trade. And she\u2019s ready for it to come back. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying. AINSLEY EARHARDT: Imagine in jobs come to America start making goods. Pharmaceuticals here \u2014 we would have so much more revenue by doing that and taking that away from China. We can\u2019t trust China. They\u2019re bad actors. LAWRENCE JONES: Some people are taking that reasonable approach as you and Steve just took, Ainsley. Some Democrats are accusing the present administration of corruption. Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs last week, along with a \u201csubstantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff\u201d for the 75 Countries \u201cwho have \u2018called Representatives of the United States,\u2019 who have \u2018negotiated a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs.'\u201d Doocy has been vocal about Trump\u2019s tariff policy in the past. Just last week, Doocy sparred with his Fox & Friends co-hosts over Trump\u2019s tariff policy after highlighting a New York Post story about a man whose business has been threatened by them: There\u2019s an item in The New York Post that we all have in front of us. It\u2019s an exclusive story. And it talks about how with these 104% tariffs that went into effect, you know, we think that China is going to have to pay for it. But it tells a story of a special needs toy importer, and when the tariffs went into affect at midnight his tariff \u2014 he\u2019s been paying a tariff because he gets stuff from China, $26,000 a year. His tariff bill went from $26,000 at midnight to $346,000. And that\u2019s money he\u2019s gonna-, have to come out of his pocket,\u201d Doocy said to kick off the conversation. \u201cIt sounds like he\u2019s going to have to go ahead and close down part of his business. He tried to make the toys in the United States, but the tariff on his most popular item went from zero to $17 at midnight. And what he told The New York Post is, \u2018People don\u2019t understand the tariff situation. They think just foreign countries are paying for the tariffs. That\u2019s not true. Half of the tariffs are being paid for by U.S. based companies.\u2019 So when you look at the big numbers and they look good, just remember that according to this guy, half of the small businesses, and half of the tariffs are being paid by Americans.\u201d Watch above via Fox News.

Focus. Usability. Consistency. Just works. I don\u2019t mind paying for an app that provides these features. They seem like simple enough concepts. But many of the apps out there today seem to be struggling. I know I am just dreaming, but here goes.. Focused I want an app that is focused on one thing. Maybe a few peripheral features if immediately relevant. But one app per task, nice focused and simple. Not bloated I want an app that is not bloated with needless features. The most current example is AI . Seems every app and their dog is stuffing AI into the mix. No ads I want an app with ZERO advertisements. I don\u2019t mind a few ads if they are relatively inconspicuous and/or dismissible. I don\u2019t mind an option to upgrade to paid version, if the app is worthwhile I definitely will do so. But keep the ads and upsell nags to a minimum. No hoops I want an app that doesn\u2019t require giving my email address just to open it. In fact I want an app that doesn\u2019t require any email or personal information whatsoever. No strings I want an app that doesn\u2019t track, store, or sell my data. I want to remain anonymous. I want my privacy. I want to use the app for its purpose without any strings attached. Usable I want an app that is usable. I\u2019m not old but my eyesight is not what it used to be. I\u2019m tired of apps that assume everyone can easily read 10-point fonts on dark backgrounds. Etc. Give me text and fonts that are clear and easy to read. Relaxed I want an app that gives me room to breathe. When using the app, I want at least SOME areas on the UI to NOT be clickable. I want to be able to touch the screen without the app taking some action. Lots of apps these days are almost impossible to use, simply because every pixel on the screen is waiting for you to click, swipe, or touch. Makes it hard to move around and enjoy the app, when everything is so crammed on the screen. No constant upgrades I want an app that doesn\u2019t upgrade every other day. Unless for important security fixes, apps shouldn\u2019t update so frequently as to give the user headaches. Updates should occur infrequently enough that the user isn\u2019t saying, \u201cI JUST updated this app\u201d, or \u201cAnother update for this app\u201d, or even take notice at all. Consistent I want an app that\u2019s consistent. Not arbitrarily making changes every other update. Like randomly redesigning and rearranging the interface. Moving buttons and features around, hiding things, and just making life difficult for all its users. Documented I want an app that is well documented. This is where consistency benefits everyone. Apps that don\u2019t randomly change everything for every update tend to have documentation that remains valid and relevant, while apps that constantly change everything tend to have outdated documentation that only adds to the confusion. More focused I want an app that doesn\u2019t add new features just to lure more customers. Just because Joe Shmoe writes in about adding some obscure functionality doesn\u2019t mean you should. It would just add more bloat without being useful to most users. App makers need to grow a spine and draw hard lines in the sand regarding the app\u2019s purpose, direction and scope. Available anywhere I want an app that is available on any device. I use Apple, Android, Windows, and Linux. And as much as possible like to streamline and sync everything into a unified workflow. So it sucks when for whatever reason an app is not available on this or that platform. In most cases this is not due to the app itself, but the petty political differences among the various platforms. App Support Added by Isocat on Mastodon : Well and helpfully supported. Make it easy and effective for me to contact the publisher when something doesn\u2019t work the way the documentation says it should. Respond helpfully and promptly. Do not offload this to the likes of ZenDesk. Do not tell me to seek answers in a \u2018community forum\u2019 where questions go to get mocked and die alone of old age. \ud83d\udc49 Also: the same things apply to web pages also, not just apps. \ud83d\udc49 Again: I don\u2019t mind paying for apps that are worth it. \ud83d\udc49 Golden rule: Always think of the user! apps About the Author Jeff Starr = Creative thinker.

Yet when you put the two together, you get a real sense of the shape of things to come. X account pipfix (@lusiRoy8) posted a photo today that shows off exactly that. At first glance, I thought I was looking at the existing blue iPhone 16 based on the color of the dummy unit. The story, of course, is the top third portion of the back of the iPhone 17 Pro Max dummy unit and case. That\u2019s where the largest camera bump bar extends in every dimension. Apple is expected to use this camera bar design on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Hopefully, the improvement in photo quality matches the camera bump\u2019s nearly doubled size! While the standard iPhone 17 will keep the same two-camera system as the iPhone 16, we expect the rumored iPhone 17 Air to replace the iPhone 16 Plus in the lineup. The Air is said to have the thinnest design of any iPhone yet. Despite having a single rear-facing camera, it will also use the camera bar design. Might the iPhone 17 Air feel a bit top heavy in the hand? We\u2019ll find out in September.

Those jumps follow the news this past weekend that smartphones and semiconductors are exempt from President Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs against China \u2014 although there was some mixed messaging from members of his administration that added a bit of confusion before markets opened. When markets closed on Monday afternoon, the S&P 500 was up 0.79%, the Nasdaq has increased 0.64% and the Dow Jones has jumped 0.78%. Apple finished the day up 2.21%, which is a welcome sight for its shareholders, after the company saw nearly $1 trillion shaved from its market cap in the week following President Trump announcing his \u201cliberation day\u201d tariff plan on April 2. The company, led by CEO Tim Cook, has rebounded in the last few trading sessions, and now has a market cap of about $3.05 trillion; before the tariffs were announced earlier this month, the company had a $3.54 trillion valuation.

The announcement, made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Friday, led to tech investors over the weekend expecting a big jump on Monday; that excitement was tempered a bit, after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on Sunday the tech carve-outs would be revisited in \u201ca month or two.\u201d The mixed messaging was then followed by President Trump posting on Truth Social on Sunday that certain devices were only being hit by the 20% tariff. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\u201d he wrote. Trump continued: \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday.

Vision Pro with a dual loop band Image: Declan Sun / Unsplash Mark Gurman wrote in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter for Bloomberg that the iPhone maker has two headsets in concurrent development. One is said to be both lighter and more affordable than the current Apple headset. The other sounds like a high-end model packing even more technology than the current headset. Gurman said nothing about its possible pricing, but it seems like that one could easily cost even more than the current $3500 Vision Pro. Rumor: Apple developing two new Vision Pro headsets Gurman writes that Apple recently broke up the internal Vision Pro Group, which had its own hardware engineering, software, services and product management teams, reintegrating its parts across other company segments. The change follows the company structure Steve Jobs established decades ago, where development is spread out across multiple functional teams. Gurman also learned that Apple\u2019s leadership contemplated whether to launch another Vision Pro model or change the headset \u201cto gain more consumer interest\u201d after spending several billion dollars on developing the first model. Apple might separate the Vision Pro into two lines: cheaper headsets with good-enough hardware and high-end headsets with cutting-edge specifications. The new plan is to release a model that makes the headset both lighter and cheaper. The current version weighs nearly 1.5 pounds and can often strain a wearer\u2019s neck and head. Many people who wear it for long periods of time require third-party straps to alleviate the discomfort. The fact that Apple offers this option on its website is an acknowledgement of the issue. Weight is an issue, but the biggest problem plaguing the Vision Pro isn\u2019t its weight but the incredibly steep $3500 price. Apple needs a much more affordable headset to compete successfully with Meta\u2019s Quest headset for the mainstream consumer. The current model is more than seven times the price of the Quest. One of the new headsets will seek to address these issues, though reducing the cost may be even more challenging with the possibility of tariffs (the Vision Pro, at least the first version, is made in China). Apple does need a cheaper Vision Pro, but \u201ccheap\u201d is a relative term in Apple talk. Earlier rumors speculated that a more affordable Vision Pro might cost between $1500 and $2500 and still require tethering to an iPhone or a Mac . Contrast this with the $500 Quest 3 and its \u201clight\u201d variant, the Quest 3S, priced at $270. At those prices, the Quest is almost an impulse purchase. The other headset in development could be even more intriguing. In January, I reported that Apple had scrapped work on augmented reality glasses that would tether to a Mac. Instead, it\u2019s now working on a Vision Pro that plugs into a Mac. The difference between the two ideas is the level of immersion. The canceled device had transparent lenses; the product still in the works will use the same approach as the Vision Pro. Tell me more! The idea is to create an ultra-low-latency system for streaming a user\u2019s Mac display or for connecting to high-end enterprise applications. Some customers have been using the Vision Pro for things like viewing imaging during surgery or for flight simulators. Those are two areas where a user would want the least amount of lag possible\u2014something that can\u2019t be guaranteed by a fully wireless system. Gurman also claimed earlier that Apple had considered a \u201cchip-and-ship\u201d refresh of the current hardware by swapping the M2 chip for an upcoming Apple M5. Gurman didn\u2019t say when we might expect these two new headsets to launch. A Chinese leaker recently suggested the next Vision Pro is now in mass production , suggesting it could drop sometime later in 2025 or in 2026. Apple AR glasses are a priority for Tim Cook Ultimately, the Vision Pro will serve as a crucial stepping stone to Tim Cook\u2019s grand vision, lightweight augmented reality glasses that could be worn all day and overlay data and images onto real-world views. Apple\u2019s boss is reportedly \u201chell-bent\u201d on beating Meta to true augmented reality spectacles and \u201ccares about nothing else.\u201d Before technology for true AR glasses is ready, Apple could release an interim product: Non-AR glasses equipped with cameras and microphones for lightweight tasks such as notifications and some Apple Intelligence features like visual intelligence. That apparently involves \u201cadding AI-enabled cameras to the Apple Watch and AirPods over the next couple of years,\u201d Gurman wrote.

Manny Pastreich, president of 32BJ SEIU added that he believes Cuomo \u201cis equipped to stand up to attacks on our city that threaten our finances, our jobs, our public transportation, our healthcare, our social security and our rights.\u201d It comes after scores of other powerful unions have already abandoned Adams\u2019 longshot re-election bid \u2014 just weeks after the mayor announced he wouldn\u2019t seek the Democratic nomination and would instead run as an independent candidate. Cuomo has been consolidating support of late. James Keivom The unions representing the city\u2019s life-saving ambulance service workers , Local 3621 and Local 2507, endorsed Cuomo last week. A slew of elected officials, too, have publicly come out in support of Cuomo, including Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres. Cuomo is the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, recent polls show. Even before Adams\u2019 party deflection, polling showed him trailing behind Cuomo in the crowded Democratic primary.

Photo: Apple Global Close Your Rings Day will give Apple Watch owners the chance to participate in a special fitness event offering both digital and physical rewards. Set for April 24, the day marks a decade of Apple Watch Activity rings helping keep users active for their health. \u201cApple Watch has changed the way people think about, monitor and engage with their fitness and health,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, in a press release Monday. \u201cA decade ago, we introduced Activity rings \u2014 and since then, Apple Watch has grown to offer an extensive set of features designed to empower every user. People write to us almost every day sharing how Apple Watch has made a difference in their life, from motivating them to move more throughout the day, to changing the trajectory of their health.\u201d Global Close Your Rings Day marks 10th anniversary of Activity rings From the Apple Watch debut in 2015 to the latest Apple Watch Series 10 , the smartwatch continues to evolve, with health- and fitness-oriented features like heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking. The watch\u2019s novel Activity rings feature \u2014 which challenges wearers to close their Move, Exercise and Stand rings every day \u2014 serves as both a motivational tool and an easy way to monitor daily activities. On April 24, Apple Watch users around the world can earn a limited-edition award by closing all three of their Activity rings. Apple encourages participants to \u201cdo something they love, push themselves further or try something new\u201d and then share their achievements on social media using the hashtag #CloseYourRings. Those who successfully close their Move, Exercise and Stand rings on Global Close Your Rings Day will receive a limited-edition digital award, along with 10 animated stickers and an animated badge for Messages . Close your Activity rings on April 24 to earn this reward, among others. Photo: Apple Apple is also bringing the celebration into the physical world. Apple Watch users can visit Apple Store locations worldwide on April 24 to collect a special pin inspired by the digital award, while supplies last. New research highlights health benefits of closing Activity rings Activity Rings are Apple Watch\u2019s way of measuring how active you are against your daily goals. Photo: Apple Alongside the announcement of Global Close Your Rings Day, Apple released findings from a new analysis of the Apple Heart and Movement Study. Based on data from more than 140,000 participants, the research revealed significant associations between regularly closing Activity rings and various aspects of health and wellness. According to the study, people who consistently closed their Activity rings were 48% less likely to experience poor sleep quality, defined as waking up frequently during the night. These same individuals were also 73% less likely to experience elevated resting heart rates, which can be an important indicator of overall fitness and cardiovascular health. Perhaps most striking was the finding that regular ring-closers were 57% less likely to report elevated stress levels, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4), a standard questionnaire used to assess stress perception. The Apple Heart and Movement Study, conducted in collaboration with Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and the American Heart Association, now includes more than 200,000 participants across the United States. A decade of fitness and health innovation Keep track of your metrics during workouts. Photo: Apple Since its introduction a decade ago, the Activity app has become one of the most popular Apple Watch features. The simple yet powerful visualization uses three concentric rings to represent daily activity: Move (active calories burned), Exercise (minutes of brisk activity), and Stand (hours in which users stand for at least one minute). Users can customize their daily goals to match their lifestyle and fitness level, with the ability to set different targets for different days of the week. The app even allows users to pause their rings when they need a rest day. Beyond Activity rings, Apple Watch offers a comprehensive suite of fitness and health features, including: The Workout app , which tracks various activities using custom heart rate and calorie algorithms specifically validated for different exercise types. Advanced metrics for popular activities like running , cycling , hiking and swimming . Motivational tools such as activity challenges , sharing capabilities, weekly summaries and trend analysis. Tracking for key fitness indicators including training load, cardio fitness and heart rate recovery . Health monitoring features for sleep stage tracking , heart health, menstrual cycles , medication management and environmental noise exposure . Based on scientific research, with privacy and secure data assured The Vitals app will tell you about unusual activity overnight. Photo: Apple Apple emphasizes that all these features are grounded in scientific research and developed with rigorous accuracy standards. The company recently published a validation summary detailing the methodologies and technologies behind Apple Watch\u2019s measurement capabilities. It noted machine learning models developed using \u201cdata from hundreds of thousands of hours of studies involving thousands of participants from diverse populations.\u201d Privacy remains central to Apple\u2019s health and fitness features. The company notes that when devices are locked with a passcode, Touch ID or Face ID , all health data in the Health app (except Medical ID information) is encrypted. Health data synced to iCloud is encrypted both during transmission and while stored on Apple\u2019s servers. With recent operating system versions and two-factor authentication enabled, health and activity data is stored in a way that even Apple cannot access it.

Fortinet researchers discovered multiple malicious NPM packages that are used to target PayPal users. The packages were uploaded to the repository in early March by a threat actor known as tommyboy_h1 and tommyboy_h2 , and were used to steal PayPal credentials and hijack cryptocurrency transfers. \u201cUsing PayPal-related names helps these malicious packages avoid detection, making it easier for attackers to steal sensitive information. By including \u201cPayPal\u201d in the name of the malicious packages, such as oauth2-paypal and buttonfactoryserv-paypal, the attackers also create a false sense of legitimacy, tricking developers into installing them.\u201d reads the analysis published by Fortinet. \u201cThe code collects and exfiltrates system data, such as usernames and directory paths, which can then be used to target PayPal accounts or be sold for fraudulent purposes.\u201d Malicious NPM packages use a preinstall hook to run hidden scripts, steal system info, obfuscate data, and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers for future attacks. Fortinet researchers recommend watching for fake PayPal-related packages, checking network logs for odd connections, removing threats, updating credentials, and staying cautious when installing packages. The same attacker likely created the tommyboy_h1 and tommyboy_h2 malicious packages to target PayPal users. \u201cThe authors of tommyboy_h1 and tommyboy_h2 are likely the same person, publishing multiple malicious packages in a short time.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attends the inauguration of Donald Trump - Copyright POOL/AFP Julia Demaree Nikhinson Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attends the inauguration of Donald Trump - Copyright POOL/AFP Julia Demaree Nikhinson Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Unfortunately, another company, OnePlus, has also contemplated the future of its handsets business for quite a while, which has led the Chief Executive to make a hard choice, and that is not to proceed with launching the OnePlus Open 2. After all, a company cannot keep mass producing such smartphones if there is no major demand for them. To recap, OnePlus is not exiting the foldable smartphone market but will be going through some evaluations to see if it can re-enter this space in the future In a forum post on the OnePlus website, Vale G clarifies that the company has made the decision to pause the process of launching future foldable smartphones and mentions that the firm will not depart from this category. While these devices do provide some utility to the masses, the biggest problem preventing foldable smartphones from becoming a mainstream success is the high pricing, which puts the brakes on the momentum. There is also the question of durability, and even though phone makers have done their level best to ensure that such smartphones boast a longer lifespan, those sporting the \u2018candy bar\u2019 form factor have always stood the test of time. Related Story OnePlus CEO Confirms That The Company Is Getting Rid Of The Alert Sliders On Future Smartphones, Likely To Make Way For A Customizable Button Similar To Apple\u2019s Action Button \u201cAt OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we\u2019ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year. While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time. As OPPO takes the lead in the foldable segment with the Find N5, we\u2019re committed to developing products that will redefine multiple categories and bring you experiences that are as innovative and exciting as ever, all while aligning closely with our Never Settle mantra. That said, our decision to pause on foldable for this generation does not signify a departure from the category. OPPO\u2019s Find N5 demonstrates remarkable advancements in foldable technology, including the use of cutting-edge new materials and more sophisticated engineering. We remain committed to incorporating these breakthroughs into our future products.\u201d Speaking with TechRadar , Rudolf Xu, Senior Product Marketing Manager for OnePlus, shared a statistic from Counterpoint Research, which mentioned that foldable smartphone shipments increased by 2.9 percent year-over-year in 2024. While the market size is growing, the growth is actually lower than what it should be, suggesting that it will take a while before other manufacturers, including OnePlus, find success in this area.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : Apple is reportedly developing two new versions of the Vision Pro headsets. This includes a lighter, more affordable model and another that connects to a Mac for lower latency. These versions are part of Tim Cook\u2019s long-term push toward true AR glasses, though technical and pricing challenges still stand in the way. Earlier this month, we heard a rumor that Apple had kicked off production on the Vision Pro 2 . The headset is launching later this year, but it might not be the only Vision Pro headset Apple is working on. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter , Apple has two versions of the Vision Pro headset in the works. Two versions of the Vision Pro The report is slightly confusing because it doesn\u2019t actually tell us when either of these models will be released. However, Gurman notes that at least two versions of Vision Pro are in development. One of the models is a lighter and less expensive version of the current Vision Pro . According to Gurman, the current model weighs about 1.5 pounds. For a headset strapped to your face, it\u2019s heavy. It places unnecessary strain on the wearer\u2019s neck, which is why some users have resorted to third-party straps to help relieve some of the discomfort. The second issue is price. At $3,500, this sits well out of reach for the casual user. Apple wants to address that in one of the models. However, as Gurman points out, the incoming Trump tariffs could present an even more difficult challenge. The next model that Apple is reportedly working on is one that can tether to a Mac via a wired connection. Right now, the Vision Pro is more or less a self-contained device. However, Apple wants to develop a version capable of tethering over a wired connection. This helps reduce latency and can act as a secondary display. Since some users are using the Vision Pro for surgeries or flight simulators, a low-latency model will benefit these types of use-case scenarios. Tim Cook\u2019s true vision According to Gurman, these upgrades are a stepping stone towards Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s grand vision of true augmented reality glasses . Gurman\u2019s sources tell him that Cook is making it a top priority and \u201c cares about nothing else .\u201d However, it might take a while before Cook\u2019s vision becomes a reality. Many obstacles stand in the way, namely technologies that have yet to be perfected. These include super-high-resolution displays, small batteries that can offer hours of usage, and a high-performing chipset that can keep up with the demand. Apple also needs to figure out a way to make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. That\u2019s one area where the Vision Pro fell short. It is a technological marvel and an instance of Apple actually delivering what it showed in the ads. However, not many people have found a use for it. Plus, the hefty price tag is a giant turn-off for many customers.

Nvidia said today it was working with partners to design and build factories to produce AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. The announcement on Monday comes amid a growing push to bring manufacturing and the technology supply chain within the borders of the U.S. as Washington imposes steep tariffs on imports. The AI chip giant said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has started production of its latest generation of chips at its factory in Phoenix, Arizona. Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Live Events The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145 per cent tariffs levied on China or the 10 per cent baseline tariffs elsewhere.

The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all experienced significant gains, with tech giants like Apple and Nvidia leading the rally. European and Asian markets also responded positively, driven by renewed confidence in the tech sector and strong Chinese export data. AI generated image US stocks rallied initial hours of trading as investors welcomed a surprise move by President Donald Trump to temporarily exempt key technology products from new tariffs. The exemption, which includes smartphones, computers, and semiconductors gave a major lift to tech-heavy indices and set a bullish tone for the start of the week. As of 1:15 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 135.58 points at 40,348.29, gaining 0.34%, while the S&P 500 added 19.32 points or 0.36%, trading at 5,382.68. The Nasdaq Composite saw a more modest rise of 0.1%, standing at 16,741.32. Markets pushed higher despite sobering data from the New York Fed\u2019s consumer expectations survey, which revealed that Americans now assign a 44% probability to the unemployment rate being higher a year from now \u2014 the most pessimistic view since April 2020, in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey also noted deteriorating sentiment toward the stock market, hitting its lowest point since June 2022, and rising concerns over near-term inflation. Commodities took a hit, with gold falling $20.60 or 0.63% to $3,224, while oil declined 0.99% to $60.89 per barrel, reflecting broader market uncertainty and possible concerns over global demand. Meanwhile, bond yields slipped as investors sought safety. The yield on the US 10-Year Treasury fell sharply by 8.8 basis points to 4.405%, its largest one-day drop in recent weeks. The EUR/USD exchange rate edged lower to 1.134, while the VIX \u2014 Wall Street \u2019s so-called fear gauge \u2014 dropped 10.12% to 33.76, indicating a short-term easing in market volatility. Meanwhile, European markets surged in early trade: Germany\u2019s DAX climbed 2.5%, France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 2.3%, and London\u2019s FTSE 100 added 1.9%, as per news agency AP. The rally was driven by renewed confidence in the tech sector, with investors anticipating short-term stability in supply chains and production costs. In Asia, the momentum was equally robust. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 closed 1.2% higher, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 2.4%, and Shanghai\u2019s Composite Index gained 0.8%. Notably, South Korean tech majors like Samsung Electronics and Advantest posted strong gains, benefitting from their deep links to the global semiconductor industry. China\u2019s March export growth, up 12.4% year-on-year, added to the region\u2019s positive tone. The strong trade data underscored resilience in manufacturing, even amid ongoing tariff friction. The US exemption announcement came shortly after China imposed tariffs of up to 125% on US goods in retaliation for escalating US duties, which have reached 145% on certain Chinese products. Though the latest move was framed as a temporary reprieve, President Trump emphasized over the weekend that no country\u2014\u201cespecially not China\u201d\u2014would escape future tariffs. Administration officials confirmed that new levies, especially on strategic goods like semiconductors, would be unveiled within weeks. Trump cited national security concerns and reiterated the goal of reshoring chip and pharmaceutical production. Investor sentiment steady Markets responded positively to the breathing room, despite lingering uncertainty. Last Friday, Wall Street closed on a high note: the S&P 500 rose 1.8%, the Dow added 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.1%. Strong quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley helped bolster confidence. The 10-year US Treasury yield, which had surged above 4.58% last week, eased to 4.44% Monday morning. While the bond market remains jittery, the retreat in yields suggests investors are cautiously rebalancing after sharp risk-off moves. Currency markets also reflected shifting dynamics. The US dollar dipped slightly, with the yen strengthening to 143.16 per dollar. The euro firmed to $1.1388, and the British pound advanced to $1.3184. Commodities Oil prices ticked higher on improved demand outlooks. West Texas Intermediate rose 1.0% to $62.10, while Brent crude added 0.9% to $65.36. The gains reflect optimism that easing trade friction, even if temporary, could support industrial activity. Gold, often a refuge in volatile times, edged down by $9 to $3,235 per ounce, as traders rotated back into equities and risk assets.

Tell me why.\u201d \u201cI think we have a negotiation going on that\u2019s been detailed at ad nauseum. It\u2019s a little chaotic from the point of view that you don\u2019t get a consistent message out of the administration. I admit that\u2019s a problem. You know, Lutnick says one thing and then Burgum says another. That\u2019s got to get cleaned up, and that\u2019s self-inflicted, they can fix that,\u201d answered O\u2019Leary before continuing: The big behemoth story we\u2019ve been talking about so much is China. We\u2019ve got to figure out where they sit in trying to come into the narrative. I mean, right now, even over, I want 400%, but that\u2019s just bombastic, 100 plus percent wipes out all trade. And so there\u2019s boats on the water waiting to bring in product. There\u2019s debate about technology like Apple phones, all this stuff. Xi at some point has to take the olive branch that\u2019s been offered twice over the weekend by Trump and say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start talking.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping him because he doesn\u2019t have the option to sell T-bills. People keep saying, \u201cOh, he\u2019s going to be disruptive by selling T- bills\u201d. That will enhance the price of his currency and make his products even less competitive worldwide. That will devastate his economy, which is already on the brink. So everybody thinks, \u201cOh he\u2019s got the leverage of selling T-bills.\u201d No he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t\u2019 have that leverage. That\u2019s just pure economics. If you study effects, you know if you start stumping T-bills, dollar goes down, his currency goes up, and he\u2019s virtually screwed. So we\u2019re in a real stalemate right here. We really are, we got some problems. \u201cBut does America hold real, heavy-duty cards in a negotiation with China?\u201d followed up Varney. \u201cIt does, Stuart, because all that stuff that\u2019s made in the factories, almost 39% of it\u2019s consumed by Americans,\u201d replied O\u2019Leary. \u201cIf he can\u2019t sell the stuff, those people don\u2019t have jobs. And that\u2019s gonna be a bad outcome for him \u2014 really bad outcome \u2014 and he knows it. That is the one massive leverage that we have at the table. If this goes on too long, there will be unemployment or there\u2019s going to be massive inflation as he prints money to pay these people in his country. It\u2019s a hundred percent stalemate. He\u2019s got to come to the table.\u201d Watch above via Fox Business Network.

Investment bank and capital market watcher Jefferies this morning published a report deliving into the US President's trade tariff policy, in which punitive import taxes are imposed and later temporarily withdrawn. This means that the only certainty is uncertainty for tech industry chiefs trying to figure out how to prioritize investments. In a new report, shared privately with The Register , Jefferies points out that even with the \"pause\" announced last week , tariffs remain higher than at the start of the year. The research note states: \"It seems unlikely we can snap back to the 'normal' cadence of decision making and it seems inevitable some decisions will push to the right,\" meaning they will be postponed. \"We see IT as a structural growth industry, but one where the timing of new business decisions can get deferred,\" Jefferies says. \"In our view, the pause in tariffs and now exemptions on electronics doesn't remove all business uncertainty. This creates earnings risk across the sector.\" IDC's EMEA VP for Devices, Francisco Jeronimo, noted that the US administration's decision to exempt key products such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs from reciprocal tariffs \"highlights a clear recognition of the economic shock such duties would deliver to American consumers, some of the most popular consumer electronics brands, and the broader tech industry.\" There are unconfirmed reports suggesting some major IT vendors, including HP, Dell, Lenovo, and Apple, may have temporarily suspended shipments of products such as PCs from China to America. This follows reports last week that many of the same companies benefited from a surge in shipments during the first quarter of 2025 as distributors and resellers stockpiled kit in the US before the tariffs took effect. \"The reality is that major US technology companies remain heavily dependent on China's highly efficient and deeply integrated manufacturing ecosystem,\" Jeronimo said. \"This deep integration leaves these companies highly exposed to disruptions stemming from trade policy shifts. Even for companies actively pursuing diversification, China often remains the primary source for these complex, high-volume products due to the sheer scale and efficiency challenges elsewhere,\" he added. How can companies in the tech sector, such as datacenter operators, hedge their bets amid all this uncertainty? Jefferies warns there are few hiding places. \"In our experience, existing contracts are rarely cancelled. However, new business decisions can be deferred and this is true across the sector,\" its report states. Tech tariff turmoil continues as Trump admin exempts some electronics, then promises to bring taxes back China ups tariffs on US goods to 125%, calls Trump's war a 'joke' Infosec experts fear China could retaliate against tariffs with a Typhoon attack Fear of tariffs made the PC market great again in Q1 as vendors emptied factories to dodge price future hikes \"Who can know what the US administration will do next?\" asked Alan Howard, principal analyst for colocation and DC building at Omdia. \"I have talked to a couple of equipment vendors who have basically said they don't know how things will play out considering a lot of equipment traverses multiple countries before landing at the final consumer. The only conclusion I've heard so far is prices will go up for consumers of that equipment to defray the additional costs. I doubt that sentiment is shocking to anyone,\" he commented. Andrew Buss, senior research director for IDC's European Enterprise Infrastructure program, said the current trade situation is very hard to guard against, particularly when the implementation is shotgun in style and unpredictable. \"Most western technology companies have invested heavily in optimized global supply chains with lean inventories and just-in-time ordering and delivery. This blunt approach with tariffs is anathema to lean supply chains, so will add significant inventory costs to many companies to buffer against constantly changing policies,\" he told us. This is just one aspect of managing international supply chains and manufacturing, Buss added. \"Rules of origin is another worry as it presents the opportunity to apply tariffs multiple times to components as they are integrated into larger and larger assemblies in different locations before integration into the final product.\" The bottom line is that in times of major uncertainty, businesses will keep a tighter grip on their purse strings. And if tech buyers can't see how much infrastructure and other resources are going to cost them, then they can't accurately forecast return on investment, and so are going to put some projects on ice, at least for the time being. \u00ae Get our Tech Resources Share More about Business China Donald Trump More like these \u00d7 More about Business China Donald Trump Tax Narrower topics Acquisitions Airbnb China Mobile China telecom China Unicom Cyberspace Administration of China Digital Services Tax DOGE Great Firewall Hong Kong Information Technology and the People's Republic of China IR35 JD.com Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation Shenzhen Umbrella Firm Uyghur Muslims Venture Capital Broader topics APAC Sector More about Share 71 COMMENTS More about Business China Donald Trump More like these \u00d7 More about Business China Donald Trump Tax Narrower topics Acquisitions Airbnb China Mobile China telecom China Unicom Cyberspace Administration of China Digital Services Tax DOGE Great Firewall Hong Kong Information Technology and the People's Republic of China IR35 JD.com Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation Shenzhen Umbrella Firm Uyghur Muslims Venture Capital Broader topics APAC Sector TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like China ups tariffs on US goods to 125%, calls Trump's war a 'joke' World War Fee Middle Kingdom retaliates against White House's 'instrument and weapon to bully and coerce' Public Sector 11 Apr 2025 | 89 EU lands 25% counter tariff punch on US, Trump pauses broad import levy hike \u2013 China excepted World War Fee Middle Kingdom gets 145%.

Apple shares led the rebound, climbing 2.2% as investors welcomed the decision to shield many tech products from tariffs that had threatened to dramatically raise consumer prices. The stock had slumped more than 9% over the past two weeks amid fears that the iPhone \u2014 largely manufactured in China \u2014 would face significant price hikes under a proposed tariff rate of up to 145%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.6%, or 107 points.

The move fueled a global rally in tech stocks, with major hardware makers and semiconductor companies leading the gains. Dell and HP jumped 4% and 2.6%, respectively. Semiconductor stocks across Europe and Asia also rallied, with Infineon, ASM International, and Foxconn among the top performers. \u201cThe removal of the worst-case scenario is an element of support (at least temporarily) for the sector,\u201d Alberto Gegra, an analyst at Equita, told Reuters. He added that the exemptions help stave off a total supply blockade that might have arisen if tariffs on Chinese-made electronics had remained in place. 3 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 300 points, or 0.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also advanced 0.8%, and thew Nasdaq rose 0.6%%. REUTERS The market reaction suggests investors believe the administration is showing greater awareness of the potential fallout from its trade policies \u2014 particularly on inflation-fatigued consumers who rely on smartphones, laptops, and other electronics. The tariffs had prompted fears of a supply-chain disruption rivaling that seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher input costs for tech firms. \u201cThe net effect is positive for tech, especially for giants like Apple, which could\u2019ve seen their entire pricing strategy thrown into disarray under the proposed 145% China tariffs,\u201d Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters. \u201cInstead, this reprieve, and news that further tariffs will be a couple of months away, gives Apple time to build up its US inventory to cover the current iPhone sales cycle without needing knee-jerk price hikes.\u201d Still, the relief may prove temporary. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cautioned on Sunday that the administration is planning new levies targeting semiconductors and tech components under a separate Section 232 national security investigation. \u201cWe expect some new measures in the coming months,\u201d he said. 3 President Trump warned that \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 on tariffs,\u201d stating that while exemptions may apply under one framework, \u201cthey\u2019ll be covered under another.\u201d REUTERS President Trump reinforced the message with a social media post warning that \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 on tariffs,\u201d stating that while exemptions may apply under one framework, \u201cthey\u2019ll be covered under another.\u201d The uncertainty hasn\u2019t prevented a short-term surge in investor confidence. Asian suppliers closely tied to US tech firms also posted gains: Foxconn rose as much as 7.8% before settling up 3%, Quanta advanced 5.8% and Inventec gained 4.1%. But broader economic concerns remain. A Wall Street Journal survey conducted in the wake of Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcement found that economists now peg the chance of a U.S. recession at 45% \u2014 nearly double the rate from January. Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio noted the economy is \u201cflirting with contraction.\u201d For now, tech stocks are enjoying a rare moment of calm. But with further tariffs looming, the industry\u2019s long-term trajectory remains deeply uncertain.

It\u2019s a Grass, Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon from the Galar region. You\u2019ll need 200 Applin Candies and 20 Tart Apples to evolve it into Flapple. Or you need 200 candies along with 20 Sweet Apples to evolve it into Appletun. When evolving to Dipplin, its final evolution is Hydrapple. Now here\u2019s the thing with the Apples. Part of the evolution requirement, they\u2019ll be out there in the wild. If you tap on them, you might get a Tart Apple, a Sweet Apple or it could be Applin itself. Remember that Apples have a better shot at showing up around Mossy Lure Modules. Did You Know? Applin spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pok\u00e9mon, by pretending it\u2019s just a fruit and nothing else. Undoubtedly, Applin is one of the cutest mon in the entire roster of Pok\u00e9mon GO. During the Sweet Discoveries event, there will be some new avatar items in the shop. You\u2019ll find an Applin Headband and an Applin Apron.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : At the end of the first quarter, Samsung still holds the majority of the smartphone market, however its lead is getting smaller and smaller. Xiaomi and vivo saw huge gains in the quarter, as well as Apple \u2013 thanks to the iPhone 16e launch. Counterpoint has released its global smartphone market share data for the first quarter of 2025. And it\u2019s not good news for Samsung. According to Counterpoint, Samsung\u2019s number of shipped units dropped by 5% year-over-year. This is compared to the first quarter of 2024, so it\u2019s essentially comparing the Galaxy S24 launch versus the Galaxy S25 launch . The good news is, Samsung only lost two percentage points in overall market share. This brings Samsung and Apple even closer in terms of market share. Apple currently has 19% for Q1, with Samsung at 18% and Xiaomi at 14%. Further back are Vivo and OPPO at 8% each. Apple, Xiaomi, and Vivo all saw more shipments in Q1 2025, while OPPO dropped by 1% with Samsung\u2019s drop. Every other OEM is included in the \u201cOthers,\u201d which did increase by 6% in unit shipments. For Apple, it looks like the iPhone 16e helped push up its market share, though it does still sit at 19%, despite shipping more units this past quarter. On the contrary, the Galaxy S25 series didn\u2019t do as well for Samsung as the Galaxy S24 series did last year, causing Samsung to drop its shipments. Xiaomi and vivo both had pretty big smartphone launches in the first quarter, though, vivo\u2019s were more mid-range phones, while Xiaomi launched its 15 series at and ahead of MWC in early March. Xiaomi is continuing to grow thanks to expansion and EVs Counterpoint noted in its report that \u201cXiaomi, continuing its strong sales momentum, gained market share, helped not only by expansion into new markets but also by significant growth in the domestic market, where the brand is enjoying a bigger and more \u2018premium\u2019 brand presence thanks to its successful foray into electric vehicles.\u201d Vivo is also the fastest-growing top-five brand right now, actually jumping into the top five this time around. Vivo\u2019s success is being attributed to its high exposure to the \u201cbuoyant China market\u201d as well as its expansion into emerging markets. HONOR, Huawei, and Motorola are also growing quickly The firm also noted that HONOR, Huawei and Motorola are growing quite quickly, despite being outside of the top five brands. Huawei was the biggest OEM in China in Q1, while HONOR and Motorola \u201cshowed high growth in multiple markets.\u201d Counterpoint also noted that \u201cnew technologies like GenAI and foldable will continue, but OEMs need to carefully monitor demand going forward.\u201d This could be a reason why OnePlus decided to skip launching any foldable devices in 2025. There are some interesting names missing from this list and report. Counterpoint did not mention Google or Pixel at all, nor did they mention OnePlus or realme. All of which seem to be doing pretty well, on all accounts. However, they are all much smaller then the other names mentioned here. Google seems to have given up its market share gains it picked up with the Pixel 9 series , and the Pixel 9a didn\u2019t go on sale until Q2 on April 10 . That could change when Counterpoint releases its Q2 numbers.

Apple had 19 percent of the smartphone market, despite flat or declining sales in the US, Europe and China, followed by Samsung with 18 percent of the market, according to Counterpoint. The International Data Corporation, which tracks mobile phone shipments, said global shipments rose 1.5 percent in the first quarter, with Apple rushing to stockpile units to avoid tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump. Apple, Nvidia Score Relief From US Tariffs With Exemptions Trump's back-and-forth tariffs and escalation of global trade tensions has resulted in global financial market turmoil for the past two weeks, a worsening economic outlook and the possibility of stronger inflation. Apple had chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones , or as many as 1.5 million, to the United States from India in an effort to beat the tariffs. However, Trump's decision to exclude smartphones, computers and some other electronics from the sweeping reciprocal duties on China led to a rise in global tech shares on Monday. Apple Said to Have Airlifted 600 Tons of iPhones From India \"The recent exemption by the US government pausing smartphone import tariffs from China offers temporary relief for US companies, but heavy reliance on China's supply chain persists amid ongoing tariff volatility,\" said Ryan Reith, group vice president, worldwide device trackers, IDC. \"Right now, the focus for US smartphone brands should be taking advantage of the exemption by building and shipping as much as possible.\" Counterpoint, which expects the smartphone market to decline this year due to tariff-related uncertainty, said Xiaomi continued its sales momentum in third place, while Vivo took the fourth spot and OPPO was fifth. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

We got our first peek at the Android XR glasses last week during a TED talk hosted by Google 's head of augmented reality and extended reality, Shahram Izadi. The specs are a significantly smaller package than the Project Moohan Android XR headset Google and Samsung are collaborating on (via Axios ) \u2013 and you can see the headset behind him on a shelf to get some sense of the size difference. You may like Samsung's rumored smart specs may be launching before the end of 2025 Android XR comes out swinging with our first look at Samsung Project Moohan, but the VR headset just makes me want AR glasses more In the surprise demo, Izadi used the glasses to perform a few tasks including live translation from Farsi to English, scanning a book using its in-built cameras, and helping them find their keys using a feature called \u2018Memory.\u2019 They also pack in a display so the wearer can receive information visually, not just via audio cues. (Image credit: Jason Redmond / TED) Now The Korea Economic Daily is claiming this prototype is Samsung-made under the duo\u2019s existing Android XR partnership \u2013 and it\u2019s slated to launch next year. While leaks should be taken with a pinch of salt we\u2019ve heard plenty of reports that Meta plans to launch its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses with a display later this year, so it\u2019s not out of the question that an Android XR device could follow soon after. What\u2019s more, given how impressive the prototype seems to be already \u2013 being able to perform a slew of tasks in a sleek package \u2013 it again seems likely that Google and Samsung aren\u2019t far from having a consumer-ready product. I just hope they aren\u2019t as pricey as Meta\u2019s glasses are rumored to be .

(Image credit: Apple) Apple is also keen to create lightweight AR specs, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman (behind a paywall). According to people familiar with Apple's AR plans \"It\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.\u201d Though according to Gurman, Apple\u2019s glasses might still be a few years away. Because true AR glasses aren't yet achievable in Apple's mind (according to people in the know) it apparently first wants to focus on equipping its Apple Watch and AirPods with AI cameras to achieve some of the functionality of the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses we have today. Given Apple\u2019s struggles with AI on the iPhone 16 it makes sense that it wouldn\u2019t currently want to focus on AI smart glasses, though it does feel it could be late to the glasses party considering how soon Samsung, Google and Meta are expected to be launching specs. As with all leaks and speculation we\u2019ll have to wait and see what Apple has up its sleeve, but it could benefit from the same advantage Google will \u2013 one that Meta lacks. The smartphone synergy strategy The most striking part of Google\u2019s prototype is the XR device looks an awful lot slimmer than other prototype AR glasses we\u2019ve seen \u2013 such as the Meta Orion AR specs and Snap\u2019s 5th-gen Spectacles developer kit. That\u2019s because it is apparently leveraging Google\u2019s biggest advantage: an Android phone according to Izadi. He explained, \"These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps.\" Because they lack their own phone brands to rely on, Meta and Snap would ideally want users to rely solely on their own standalone platform \u2013 one which they have complete control over to introduce the apps and experiences they most want to build. Control they don\u2019t have when merely piggybacking off Android via phone apps. Google, seeing as it runs the Android ecosystem, likely isn\u2019t keen for people to abandon its phones quite yet. Snap's spectacles are cool, but bulky (Image credit: Future) So its glasses are instead designed to leverage the processors in your phone rather than a sophisticated chipset built into the glasses themselves (though we suspect they still have a little onboard processing power for simple display and camera operations). This allows Google to remove some of the bulk a beefy chipset requires \u2013 such as sophisticated cooling and a bigger battery \u2013 to create a slimmer end product without sacrificing overall performance (at least in theory). Apple could leverage a similar smartphone-to-glasses relationship with its own AR specs, though Meta and Snap\u2019s third-party approach has one advantage in that they are system agnostic. You can use which smartphone you want, or you might not even need a smartphone at all. Hopefully Google\u2019s symbiotic relationship between its glasses and phones results in smart specs that aren\u2019t as pricey as its competitors, as they don\u2019t need to pack in as many components. For example, Meta\u2019s rumored upcoming XR glasses with a screen are expected to cost as much as $1,400 (\u00a31,100 / AU$2,200). For now we'll need to wait and see, but Google and Samsung's smart specs look promising, and if they are set to launch next year 2026 can't come soon enough. You might also like...

This post is based on Mr. Fink\u2019s annual letter to investors. I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader\u2014nearly every person\u2014I talk to: They\u2019re more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory. I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out. Humans are smart, resilient creatures, and we build systems that reflect our own image\u2014 systems that take the confusion around us, make sense of it, and produce surprisingly good outcomes. Computers handle complex data (and now language) on our behalf. Cities enable millions of people to live side by side, usually peacefully, mostly productively. But of all the systems we\u2019ve created, among the most powerful\u2014and uniquely suited to moments like ours\u2014began over 400 years ago. It\u2019s the system we invented specifically to overcome contradictions like scarcity amid abundance, and anxiety amid prosperity. We call this system the capital markets. When the world\u2019s first stock exchange opened in Amsterdam in 1602, investing became a more democratic enterprise. Until then, investing was mostly reserved for wealthy merchants. And indeed, about 90% of the original 1,143 investors at Amsterdam\u2019s exchange were wealthy. But the remaining investors were ordinary people. They included 53 artisans, eight shopkeepers, six silk weavers, four soap makers\u2014and at least two maids who each invested 50 guilders, about enough to rent a modest cottage for a year. [1] Even when the capital markets crossed the channel into England, with its rigid class system, the London Stock Exchange didn\u2019t start in a palace. Instead, it began in Jonathan\u2019s Coffee House in \u201cChange Alley.\u201d Bishops and bookkeepers invested alongside farmers who arrived straight from the cattle market, with mud still on their boots. Some came to speculate, but many were there to invest in new ventures\u2014including an especially promising one: The Bank of England. For the first time, ordinary people didn\u2019t just watch the economy grow around them. They owned a share of that growth\u2014a real, tradable share. [2] Four centuries on, our markets have dramatically evolved from an alleyway coffee shop. But they fundamentally still work the same way\u2014as a prosperity flywheel: people invest their savings, markets channel those funds into companies and industries, and any success flows back to investors\u2014helping them afford retirement, college, and homes. And the wheel keeps turning. Market participation has exploded in our lifetimes. During the first half of the 20th century, the percentage of Americans owning stocks crept up from just 1% to 4%. [3] But since 1976, when I showed up for my first Wall Street job\u2014sporting long hair, turquoise jewelry, and the world\u2019s ugliest brown suit\u2014investing has become far more fashionable (and, thankfully, so have I). By 1989, just under a third of American families had money in the markets; today, it\u2019s roughly 60%. [4] These investors have benefited from the greatest period of wealth creation in human history. Over the past 40 years, global gross domestic product (GDP) has grown more than in the previous two thousand combined. [5] This extraordinary growth\u2014partly propelled, it must be noted, by historically low interest rates\u2014has driven exceptional long-term returns. But of course, not everyone has shared in this wealth. This extraordinary era of market expansion has coincided with\u2014and was largely fueled by\u2014 globalization. And while a flatter world lifted 1 billion people out of $1-a-day poverty, it also held back millions in wealthier nations striving for a better life. Today, many countries have twin, inverted economies: one where wealth builds on wealth; another where hardship builds on hardship. The divide has reshaped our politics, our policies, even our sense of what\u2019s possible. Protectionism has returned with force. The unspoken assumption is that capitalism didn\u2019t work and it\u2019s time to try something new. But there\u2019s another way to look at it: Capitalism did work\u2014just for too few people. Markets, like everything humans build, aren\u2019t perfect. They reflect us\u2014unfinished, sometimes flawed, but always improvable. The solution isn\u2019t to abandon markets; it\u2019s to expand them, to finish the market democratization that began 400 years ago and let more people own a meaningful stake in the growth happening around them. In the pages (or pixels) ahead, I\u2019ll offer some thoughts on how we can further democratize investing in two broad ways: by helping current investors access parts of the market they\u2019ve previously been restricted from by enabling more people to become investors in the first place I\u2019ll begin with BlackRock\u2019s work, but both of these efforts extend beyond asset management, touching broader issues like retirement policy, energy, and tokenization. More investment. More investors. That\u2019s the answer. Given that BlackRock is a fiduciary and the largest asset manager in the world, some readers might contend I\u2019m talking my own book. Fair enough. But it\u2019s also the book we intentionally chose\u2014long before it was a bestseller. From the start, we believed that when people can invest better, they can live better\u2014and that\u2019s exactly why we built BlackRock. Unlocking private markets BlackRock\u2019s past 14 months \u2014 and the future Economies run on capital. Whether you\u2019re assembling 17th-century trading fleets or 21st-century data centers, the money has to come from somewhere. But historically, it hasn\u2019t been investors. Despite 400 years of financial innovation, from Amsterdam to Change Alley to the New York Stock Exchange, most financing has come from banks, corporations, and governments\u2014not the capital markets. Why banks, corporations, and governments? Because that\u2019s where people put their money. They parked their savings in bank accounts, drove corporate growth through consumption, and paid taxes that fund public spending. But when my partners and I founded BlackRock in 1988, we believed the world was changing. The capital markets wouldn\u2019t just supplement banks, corporations, and governments\u2014they\u2019d stand alongside them as a coequal source of capital. The logic was simple: Markets delivered better returns than the other three. Better returns would attract more investors. More investors would deepen markets. And deeper markets meant more capital. Plus, asset managers could accelerate this shift through innovation. For BlackRock, that meant first developing better technology to manage risk, then expanding choice and lowering fees through products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We\u2019ve been fortunate these past 37 years. Our logic panned out. But what\u2019s striking now is how early we still are in the story of market expansion. The real payoff is only just beginning. As we enter our century\u2019s second quarter, there\u2019s a growing mismatch between the demand for investment and the capital available from traditional sources. Governments can\u2019t fund infrastructure through deficits. The deficits can\u2019t get much higher. Instead, they\u2019ll turn to private investors. Meanwhile, companies won\u2019t rely solely on banks for credit. Bank lending is constrained. Instead, businesses will go to the markets. The money is already there. In fact, more capital is sitting idle today than at any point in my career. In the U.S. alone, roughly $25 trillion is parked in banks and money market funds. [7] But we\u2019re repeating a mistake from the earliest days of finance: Abundant capital. Deployed too narrowly. As one historian wrote, Amsterdam\u2019s first stock exchange \u201ccould have made a much greater contribution to the economy\u201d if investors had more companies to invest in. The same is true today. [8] Assets that will define the future\u2014data centers, ports, power grids, the world\u2019s fastest-growing private companies\u2014aren\u2019t available to most investors. They\u2019re in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants. The reason for the exclusivity has always been risk. Illiquidity. Complexity. That\u2019s why only certain investors are allowed in. But nothing in finance is immutable. Private markets don\u2019t have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve spent the past year doing at BlackRock. BlackRock has always had a foot in private markets. But we\u2019ve been\u2014first and foremost\u2014a traditional asset manager. That\u2019s who we were at the start of 2024. But it\u2019s not who we are anymore. In the past 14 months, we\u2019ve announced the acquisition of two of the top firms in the fastest-growing areas of private markets: infrastructure and private credit. We bought another firm to get better data and analytics, so we can better measure risk, spot opportunities, and unlock access to private markets. We\u2019ve transformed our company. The next section details why we did it, how we did it, and why it matters. The $68 trillion investment boom: Who will own it? Throughout history, infrastructure has driven a surprising amount of economic growth. Between 1860 and 1890, just building railroads boosted U.S. GDP by roughly 25%. [9] A century later, highways did something similar: By one measure, investments in the interstate system accounted for about a quarter of productivity gains between 1950 and 1989. [10] Today, we\u2019re standing at the edge of an opportunity so vast it\u2019s almost hard to grasp. By 2040, the global demand for new infrastructure investment is $68 trillion. [11] To put that price tag in perspective, it\u2019s roughly the equivalent of building the entire Interstate Highway System and the Transcontinental Railroad, start to finish, every six weeks\u2014 for the next 15 years. [12] Over the past year, I\u2019ve argued that governments\u2014already weighed down by historic deficits\u2014cannot rely solely on taxpayers to shoulder the staggering costs of new infrastructure without risking a debt spiral. But governments aren\u2019t alone in facing constraints. Even the world\u2019s largest tech companies, despite their billions in free cash flow, aren\u2019t equipped for this scale of investment. A single AI data center can cost between $40 billion and $50 billion. [14] When I talk to tech leaders, they often tell me their companies want to stay focused on what they do best\u2014inventing groundbreaking technology, not on financing the massive infrastructure needed to deploy it. The markets are eager to step in where governments and corporations are stepping out. Investors are already voting with their dollars\u2014making infrastructure one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing market segments. This investment, however, is being throttled because of the way our capital markets are structured. Private markets are private Most of us associate \u201cmarkets\u201d with public markets\u2014stocks, bonds, commodities. But you generally cannot buy shares in a new high-speed rail line or a next-generation power grid on the London or New York Stock Exchange. Instead, infrastructure projects are typically investable only through private markets. Private markets are, as their name suggests, private. For individual investors, they often require higher minimum investments. And even when the minimums are lower, investing is often limited to people with a certain income or net worth. The same hurdles apply to most of the world\u2019s companies. Only a tiny fraction are publicly traded, and that fraction is shrinking: The path BlackRock took 25 years ago\u2014raising money through an IPO\u2014is becoming rarer. Instead, 81% of U.S. companies with over $100 million in revenue are privately held. The percentage is higher in the EU, and even higher in the U.K. Yet these companies still need money to innovate and grow. For decades, they turned to banks, much like families turn to lenders for home mortgages. But that era is rapidly fading. Today, banks by themselves cannot meet the capital demands of growing companies. The private credit industry is stepping in to help fill that gap. In fact, private credit assets are projected to more than double by the end of this decade. [16] Yet, as with infrastructure, many individual investors aren\u2019t able to participate in the growth. Even some larger institutional investors have trouble building a portfolio that allocates these assets the way they want. From 60/40 to 50/30/20 The beauty of investing in private markets isn\u2019t about owning a particular bridge, tunnel, or mid-sized company. It\u2019s how these assets complement your stocks and bonds\u2014 diversification. Diversification has been called the \u201conly free lunch.\u201d It was the motivating idea that led Nobel Prize-winning economists like Harry Markowitz and Bill Sharpe to develop Modern Portfolio Theory, which became the foundation for the standard portfolio of roughly 60% stocks and 40% bonds. Generations of investors have done well following this approach, owning a mix of the entire market rather than individual securities. But as the global financial system continues to evolve, the classic 60/40 portfolio may no longer fully represent true diversification. The future standard portfolio may look more like 50/30/20\u2014stocks, bonds, and private assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit. The appeal is clear. While these private assets may carry greater risk, they also provide great benefits. For example, infrastructure offers: Inflation protection \u2014The revenue infrastructure generates\u2014such as tolls and utility payments\u2014typically rises along with inflation. Stability \u2014Unlike public markets, infrastructure returns tend to be far less volatile. [17] Returns \u2014Historically, even allocating just 10% of a portfolio to infrastructure boosts overall returns. [18] But the challenge is this: The industry isn\u2019t structured for a 50/30/20 world. It\u2019s largely split between traditional asset managers focused strictly on the 50/30 (stocks and bonds) and specialized private market firms dominating the 20 (private assets). Bridging the divide between the 50/30 and the 20 is almost impossible for most individuals. Even those who can afford it face another diversification problem within that 20%. Often, they barely have enough capital to meet the minimum for just one private fund\u2014and having 20% of your portfolio locked up in a single fund isn\u2019t really diversified. We can help investors get to a better outcome. The divide between public and private markets is a tough problem\u2014but it\u2019s solvable. In fact, BlackRock has solved market challenges like this before. Before public vs. private, there was index vs. active In 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors (BGI). They had created iShares, the leading ETF business in the world. [20] Back then, most people thought our acquisition was just a bet on ETFs. But it was actually much bigger than that. At the time, the investment world was split in a different way: On one side were index funds, like the ETFs that BGI offered\u2014low-cost, rules-based portfolios simply tracking indices like the S&P 500. On the other side were active investments, managed by portfolio managers trying to beat the market. The industry acted as if you had to pick a side\u2014as though these two approaches were mutually exclusive. Our BGI acquisition was rooted in a belief that they weren\u2019t. We realized every investing decision is active, even if you\u2019re just picking an index fund. After all, there\u2019s an index for large cap value, large cap growth, total stock market, emerging markets, energy stocks, financials, small cap Brazilian stocks\u2014and everything in between. Choosing among them requires making important decisions\u2014like the right mix of investments, the amount of risk you\u2019re comfortable taking, and how you manage that risk. When we combined active and index strategies under one roof, we gave investors something they\u2019d never had before: the freedom to blend strategies seamlessly. ETFs stopped being purely passive. Instead, they became essential building blocks for creating any type of portfolio\u2014active, index, or a combination of both. Diversification became easier. Fees got lower. In fact, since 2015, our ETFs have saved our clients $642 million in fees. [21] Most importantly, investors finally had more control over their money\u2014whether they were individuals saving for retirement or big institutions managing billions. Now, we see an opportunity to do for the public-private market divide what we did for index vs. active. In October, BlackRock completed the first of three acquisitions\u2014Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)\u2014to erase the boundary holding investment back. GIP and the infrastructure opportunity GIP owns some of the world\u2019s most important infrastructure assets on behalf of our clients\u2014London\u2019s Gatwick Airport, key energy pipelines, and over 40 global data centers. They\u2019re experts at finding the world\u2019s most attractive infrastructure investments, and channeling capital to build or improve them. GIP, put another way, is itself a pipeline\u2014 connecting BlackRock\u2019s clients directly to the world\u2019s $68 trillion infrastructure boom, including data centers. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized, \u201cRight now, we are $150 billion of AI infrastructure into trillions of dollars we have to go build\u2014and so we have partnerships with BlackRock.\u201d [22] That partnership also includes xAI, Microsoft, MGX\u2014and most importantly, BlackRock\u2019s clients. [23] It\u2019s their capital that will fuel the rise of this century\u2019s defining technology\u2014and reap its returns. All of that is made possible through GIP. So was our landmark ports announcement this month. The agreement in principle covers a network of 43 ports across 23 countries. One in every 20 shipping containers moving around the world passes through these ports each year. [24] Our partners include one of the world\u2019s leaders in shipping and logistics\u2014Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)\u2014and one of the world\u2019s largest global container terminal operators\u2014Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). Upon closing of this deal, our consortium will have a portfolio of approximately 100 ports around the world. Together, we know how to invest in, own, and operate these assets. In fact, GIP is an expert at making infrastructure more efficient. When they bought Gatwick Airport, they managed to cut security screening times by more than half\u2014partly through simple solutions like oversized luggage trays. This gave travelers more time to shop and eat, boosting the airport\u2019s profitability. In other words, we\u2019re not just giving our clients access to more infrastructure, but good infrastructure that we make better. [25] HPS, Preqin, and why private markets don\u2019t have to be opaque markets At the same time we were finalizing the GIP deal, BlackRock was also busy with two other significant acquisitions. We began the summer of 2024 by announcing our planned purchase of Preqin, one of the world\u2019s leading data firms in private markets. Then, we ended the year by announcing our planned acquisition of HPS Investment Partners, a premier manager of private credit. These acquisitions will give our clients more direct access to private markets\u2014the kind that finance global businesses and keep consumer economies running. But there\u2019s also deeper, long-term strategic thinking at play. For decades, private markets have been among the most opaque corners of finance. Investors know these assets hold long-term value\u2014but exactly how much value? That\u2019s not always easy to determine. A good analogy is real estate. If you\u2019re buying a home, you want to know if you\u2019re paying a fair price, and there are ways to do that. You can check neighborhood benchmarks, recent sales, or historical appreciation trends; companies like Zillow have made this simple. But today, investing in private markets feels a bit like buying a house in an unfamiliar neighborhood before Zillow existed, where finding accurate prices was difficult or impossible. This lack of transparency discourages investment. Our acquisitions are designed to change that. For instance, Preqin provides the industry\u2019s most comprehensive private markets data set. The company tracks over 190,000 funds and 60,000 managers. This rich data set provides clarity on performance across managers and funds, and it also offers comparable valuations for the assets they own. In other words, Preqin effectively does for private markets what Zillow did for housing. Or, if you prefer a financial sector comparison, what Bloomberg terminals did for stocks and bonds. But the vision goes even further. With clearer, more timely data, it becomes possible to index private markets just like we do now with the S&P 500. Once that happens, private markets will be accessible, simple markets. Easy to buy. Easy to track. And that means capital will flow more freely throughout the economy. The prosperity flywheel will spin faster, generating more growth\u2014not just for the global economy or large institutional investors, but for investors of all sizes around the world. A new era for investing In some ways, this moment feels like a bookend to how BlackRock started. Back in 1988, our first employee\u2014the late and dearly missed Charles Hallac\u2014bought a single computer. It cost $25,000 and was roughly the size of a washing machine. Charlie wedged it between our refrigerator and the coffee maker, and on that one machine started to build Aladdin. The software gave investors something they\u2019d never had before: a clear, unified view of portfolio risk. It fundamentally changed the way investing worked. Looking back over 37 years, BlackRock\u2019s founding didn\u2019t just launch a company; it transformed an entire industry. Decades from now, we might reflect on 2025 as another pivotal moment, when the financial landscape shifted once again. But this future won\u2019t be shaped by asset managers alone. Markets never exist in isolation. The economic rules we choose, the investment policies we adopt, and the ways countries attract and deploy capital will determine who benefits\u2014and how broadly prosperity spreads. That\u2019s the challenge I\u2019ll tackle next. And the best place to start is where most of us hope to finish: with a comfortable, financially secure retirement. From retirement to tokenization How all of us can democratize investing On September 30, 1933, during the depths of the Great Depression, a small California newspaper, The Long Beach Telegram, published a letter from Francis Townsend. He was a local doctor who\u2019d written his letter in a burst of anger after witnessing elderly women scavenging for food in the street. His proposal\u2014$200 per month for every American over 60\u2014touched off the movement that led to Social Security in the U.S. [26] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Social Security keeps nearly 30 million Americans from sliding into poverty each year\u2014an extraordinary achievement. [27] And yet, projections show Social Security\u2019s retirement and disability funds will run out by 2035. After that, people would get only 83% of their promised benefits, and that percentage will drop over time. [28] But even if we shore up Social Security, it\u2019s not enough. The system was designed to do exactly what Francis Townsend had in mind: keep older people out of poverty. But escaping poverty doesn\u2019t equal financial security. That\u2019s why today, even with the promise of Social Security, more than half of Americans still fear outliving their savings more than death itself. [29] A good retirement system provides a safety net to catch people when they fall. But a great system also offers a ladder\u2014a way to grow savings, compounding wealth year after year. That\u2019s where the U.S. falls short. Right now, the country focuses heavily on preventing people from hitting the floor, as we should. But the U.S. needs to put just as much effort into helping people climb to the ceiling\u2014through investing. More than half the money BlackRock manages is retirement money. [30] It\u2019s our core business, which makes sense: For most people, retirement accounts are their first\u2014and often their only\u2014experience with investing. So, if we really want to democratize investing, retirement is where the conversation has to start. While BlackRock helps people invest for retirement all over the world, I want to focus on the U.S. in this section. Because the situation is dire. Public pensions are facing huge shortfalls. Nationwide, the data shows they\u2019re only about 80% funded\u2014and that\u2019s probably an overly optimistic number. [31] Meanwhile, a third of the country has no retirement savings at all. No pensions, no 401(k)\u2014nothing. [32] As money runs shorter, lives are getting longer. Today, if you\u2019re married and both of you reach 65, there\u2019s a 50/50 chance at least one of you lives until 90. [33] And with biomedical breakthroughs like GLP-1 drugs, many more chronic diseases might soon become curable. That\u2019s an incredible blessing\u2014but it also underscores something frustrating: We\u2019re great at extending people\u2019s lives, yet we hardly spend any effort helping them afford those extra years. It\u2019s the problems we don\u2019t talk about that should worry us most. And, by that measure, I\u2019m less worried about the U.S. retirement crisis than I was a month ago. In March, BlackRock hosted a retirement summit in Washington, D.C., bringing together Republicans and Democrats, asset managers and pension funds, small business owners, firefighters, teachers, union members, and farmers. It was an eclectic group, and that was the point. Good ideas can come from unexpected places. After all, the most important retirement program in U.S. history started as an op-ed from an unknown doctor in a tiny newspaper. That same dynamic played out at the summit: We saw consensus around practical ideas to help more Americans start investing, grow their savings to hit their retirement goals, and confidently spend down what they\u2019ve earned\u2014so that Americans don\u2019t have to fear running out of money, certainly not more than death itself. Where do we start? At the summit, one panel featured a firefighter who recalled how, as a rookie, he\u2019d enrolled in a pension without even knowing it. A veteran fireman gave him a form\u2014and an order: \u201cJust sign it. You\u2019ll thank me in 25 years.\u201d And he did. Every American deserves to start investing that easily. But for millions, investing still isn\u2019t even an option. There are three ways we can start addressing this. First, expand emergency savings. No one invests for retirement if they\u2019re worried about paying for a flat tire or ER visit tomorrow. Yet that\u2019s the reality for one-third of U.S. voters who say they couldn\u2019t handle an unexpected $500 expense. [34] What\u2019s a solution? BlackRock\u2019s philanthropic foundation has worked with a group of nonprofits to establish an Emergency Savings Initiative, helping mostly low-income Americans put away $2 billion in \u201cemergency savings accounts.\u201d [35] We\u2019ve found that people with these dedicated rainy-day funds are much more likely to invest for retirement\u201470% more likely according to one study. [36] Congress scaled this idea nationwide in 2022 with the SECURE 2.0 Act. The law allows workers to save up to $2,500 in emergency accounts linked to retirement plans, including employer matching and easy withdrawals. [37] But it\u2019s just a start. We can simplify the rules further, raise contribution limits, and enable automatic enrollment in standalone emergency accounts. Second, close the small business 401(k) gap. Half of Americans work for small businesses, yet nearly half those businesses offer no retirement plan. [38] This is fixable. States experimenting with incentives have driven up 401(k) adoption and employee savings. Policymakers can lean in more here, helping small businesses offer plans and auto-enroll workers. Third, help people start investing earlier. At our retirement summit, Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Todd Young (R-IN) talked about a market-based spin on \u201cbaby bonds.\u201d The idea would be to open an investment account for every American child on the day they\u2019re born. Senator Booker mentioned it could be seeded by redirecting a fraction of existing tax breaks that mostly benefit the wealthy. It\u2019s an interesting concept. Even a small amount could compound into a very large portfolio over a lifetime. Many state and federal policymakers have proposed versions of this plan over the years. And I think it\u2019s an idea worth revisiting. The real payoff isn\u2019t just financial\u2014it\u2019s foundational. When people own a piece of the economy, they don\u2019t just benefit from growth; they believe in it. Ownership creates connection. It turns passive observers into participants. Imagine a child born today whose personal wealth grows in step with America\u2019s. That\u2019s what an economic democracy could look like: a country where everybody has a new avenue\u2014 investing\u2014to pursue happiness and financial freedom. How do you reach $2,089,000? Once people start investing for retirement, the goal is simple: make their money grow\u2014 as much as possible, as fast as possible. In January, BlackRock surveyed Americans, asking how much money they\u2019d need to retire comfortably. When we took the average of those responses, it was just over $2 million\u2014 $2,089,000, to be exact. That\u2019s a lot. More than I was expecting. And almost no one is close. Even Gen-Xers, the oldest of whom will start retiring in five years, are falling short. In fact, 62% have saved less than $150,000. [39] We\u2019re going to need better ways to boost portfolios. As I wrote earlier, private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns. Pension funds have invested in these assets for decades, but 401(k)s haven\u2019t. It\u2019s one reason why pensions typically outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% each year. [40] Half a percent doesn\u2019t sound huge, but it adds up over time. BlackRock estimates that over 40 years, an extra 0.5% in annual returns results in 14.5% more money in your 401(k). It\u2019s enough to fund nine more years of retirement, helping you stop working on your own terms. Or, put another way, private assets just bought you nine extra years hanging out with your grandkids. [41] If private assets perform so well, why aren\u2019t they in your 401(k)? One major reason is that it\u2019s unfamiliar territory for the 401(k) providers who select the investments offered in your plan. When you invest in private assets\u2014like a bridge, for example\u2014the values of those assets aren\u2019t updated daily, and you can\u2019t withdraw your money whenever you want. It\u2019s a bridge, after all\u2014not a stock. While BlackRock, as I\u2019ve previously written, is working to make the markets for these assets more price-transparent and liquid, many 401(k) providers haven\u2019t yet adapted to this evolving financial landscape. Indeed, including assets like real estate or infrastructure in a 401(k) has become practical only within the past five to ten years. This is complex stuff. It requires clarification. Asset managers, private-market specialists, consultants, and advisors all play a role in guiding 401(k) providers. That\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m writing this letter\u2014to cut through the fog. We need to make it clear: Private assets are legal in retirement accounts. They\u2019re beneficial. And they\u2019re becoming increasingly transparent. Target date funds are a great place to start. People love their simplicity: You just pick the year you plan to retire\u20142040, 2055, 2060\u2014and let the fund do the rest. That simplicity makes target date funds ideal for introducing private assets. The usual barriers for 401(k) providers\u2014like daily valuations or immediate liquidity\u2014matter far less when you\u2019re investing over several decades. How can we help people spend what they\u2019ve saved? Building a nest egg is only half the challenge. The other half\u2014especially for 401(k) savers\u2014 is knowing how to spend it. Most pension holders don\u2019t worry about this. Their income arrives each month, like a steady paycheck. But a 401(k) doesn\u2019t come with instructions. When you retire, you\u2019re handed a lump sum and asked to make it last for the rest of your life\u2014without knowing how long that will be. The result? Even retirees who\u2019ve saved well often spend too little, gripped by fear that they\u2019ll run out. They downsize dreams and delay joy. The economist Bill Sharpe called this problem the \u201cnastiest, hardest problem in finance.\u201d Hard, but solvable. Last year, BlackRock introduced LifePath Paycheck\u00ae to tackle this fear. It gives people the option to convert 401(k) retirement savings into a steady, reliable monthly income. In just 12 months, LifePath Paycheck\u00ae has already attracted six plan sponsor clients representing 200,000 individual retirement savers. But no one is declaring victory. The problem will only get harder and nastier as the oldest Gen-Xers start to retire. They\u2019re the first generation primarily dependent on 401(k)s. And the 401(k) trend is growing with Millennials and Gen Z. Their employers need to offer solutions that turn their savings into predictable income. This way, every American can retire with confidence. We can\u2019t democratize investing if it takes 13 years to build a power line. In the U.S., retirement investing accounts for about 30% of the money flowing through the stock market. [42] It\u2019s the biggest opportunity we have to help more people grow alongside the wider economy. But just as retirement isn\u2019t the whole market, it\u2019s not the whole solution. For example, giving retirement investors access to infrastructure matters less if the infrastructure never gets built. That\u2019s often the case today. In both the U.S. and the EU, it usually takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than to construct them. A high-voltage power line can take 13 years to get approved\u2014 something China does in a quarter of the time. [43] Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson expertly illustrate this permitting nightmare in their new book, Abundance. One particularly vivid passage places California\u2019s stalled bullet train project in historical context: \u201cCalifornia\u2026 built all but a few hundred miles of the western portion of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1860s. The project spanned nearly 1,800 miles. It took just six years to finish. These days, six years is roughly the amount of time it takes California to realize that its bullet train needs to be pushed back by another decade. In the time California has spent failing to complete its 500-mile high-speed rail system, China has built more than 23,000 miles of high-speed rail.\u201d But it\u2019s delays in energy infrastructure, they write, that \u201ccould be chaotic at best, and catastrophic at worst.\u201d [44] Global electricity demand is surging, driven in part by the rise of AI. A single data center can draw 1 gigawatt of electricity. That\u2019s enough to power the entire city of Honolulu on the hottest day of the year. [45] In Utah, Ohio, and Texas, utilities have already warned that AI-driven electricity demand will push their grids past capacity. Even Silicon Valley Power has stopped accepting new data center requests. [46] Without massive investments in energy generation and transmission\u2014and the electricians and engineers to build them\u2014we\u2019re going to face an unacceptable tradeoff: Who gets the electricity\u2014people or machines? And a society that chooses to cool its servers while its citizens swelter\u2014or freeze\u2014has fundamentally misplaced its priorities. We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix. Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can\u2019t reliably keep the lights on. In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down. [47] Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear. But it\u2019s increasingly rare. Over the past 55 years, the United States has shut down more nuclear plants than it\u2019s built. As Klein and Thompson write, \u201cThat is not a failure of the private market to responsibly bear risk but of the federal government to properly weigh risk.\u201d [48] After all, today\u2019s nuclear isn\u2019t the old model of massive plants with the ominous cooling towers. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are everything old nuclear wasn\u2019t\u2014cheaper to build, safer to run, and you can build them anywhere. China isn\u2019t waiting. They\u2019re building 100 gigawatts of nuclear, which\u2014when completed\u2014 will mean they supply half the planet\u2019s nuclear power. Why is China so bullish on nuclear? They see decarbonization as a way to own the future of industry. [49] Consider BYD. The Chinese automaker sells more electric vehicles (EVs) than any other company in the world. Next year, they plan to add full autonomous capabilities to their cars\u2014at the same price as last year\u2019s models. [50] They already sell EVs for just $10,000\u2014a price no U.S. or European automaker can match. Within five years, China may have completely phased out internal combustion engines\u2014not just for environmental reasons, but also to corner the global market on driverless, battery-powered vehicles\u2014cars that don\u2019t require gas and cost a third as much as their foreign competitors. There\u2019s a fascinating relationship between a country\u2019s wealth and its energy consumption. The correlation is nearly perfect: more energy, more wealth. At some point, though, this relationship is supposed to break down. As economies grow richer, they typically keep growing with less incremental energy, thanks to efficiency gains. But you could argue that\u2019s not the case anymore. Even in the richest nations, prosperity is once again defined by our ability\u2014and our willingness\u2014to produce and consume more energy. Should we be bullish about Europe again? BlackRock was born in America, and our first clients were in Japan\u2014but it was Europe that made us truly global. Our 2006 acquisition of Merrill Lynch\u2019s asset management business, anchored in London, set us on the path to becoming the largest asset manager in the world. Today, we manage $2.7 trillion for our European clients, including approximately 500 pension schemes supporting millions of people. For the past decade, Europe\u2019s economic outlook has been persistently pessimistic. Slow growth, stagnant markets, and cumbersome regulation have dominated the headlines. Mario Draghi, former Italian Prime Minister and head of the European Central Bank, recently pointed out that Europe has lowered trade barriers with countries outside the continent\u2014but it hasn\u2019t done the same internally among EU nations. Draghi highlighted an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which paints a striking picture: For a German company, it may now be more attractive to do business in China than in neighboring France. [52] But I think Europe is waking up. The policymakers I talk to\u2014and I talk to a lot\u2014now see that the regulatory roadblocks aren\u2019t going to remove themselves. They need to be addressed. And the upside is enormous. According to the IMF, reducing intra-EU trade barriers to the level between U.S. states could boost productivity by nearly 7%, adding an astounding $1.3 trillion to its economy\u2014the equivalent of creating another Ireland and Sweden. [53] Even better, artificial intelligence may be able to defuse Europe\u2019s demographic time bomb. The continent\u2019s biggest looming economic challenge is its aging workforce. In 22 of the 27 EU member states, the working-age population is already shrinking. [54] And because economic growth depends heavily on the size of a country\u2019s labor force, Europe faces the risk of prolonged economic decline. The European Commission itself recently sounded the alarm: Sustained growth is only possible if Europe\u2019s workforce either expands, becomes more productive, or both. [55] This is precisely where AI might play a crucial role. In economies heavily dependent on manufacturing and manual labor, AI has less impact. But in service-based economies, where AI can effectively automate tasks, productivity gains can be substantial. There\u2019s a worry that AI might eliminate jobs. It\u2019s a valid concern. But in aging, wealthy societies facing inevitable labor shortages, AI may be less a threat than a lifeline. Can Bitcoin eat away at the U.S. dollar\u2019s reserve status? The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world\u2019s reserve currency for decades. But that\u2019s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square\u2019s debt clock started ticking in 1989. [57] This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion\u2014 exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. [58] If the U.S. doesn\u2019t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I\u2019m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America\u2019s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar. Tokenization is democratization The world\u2019s money moves through plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary. Take the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). It\u2019s the system that underpins trillions of dollars in global transactions every day, and it works much like a relay race: Banks hand off instructions one by one, meticulously checking details at each step. That relay approach made sense in the 1970s, an analog era when the markets were much smaller and daily transactions were much fewer. But today, relying on SWIFT feels like routing emails through the postal office. Tokenization changes all that. If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself\u2014 assets move directly and instantly, sidestepping intermediaries. What exactly is tokenization? It\u2019s turning real-world assets\u2014stocks, bonds, real estate\u2014into digital tokens tradable online. Each token certifies your ownership of a specific asset, much like a digital deed. Unlike traditional paper certificates, these tokens live securely on a blockchain, enabling instant buying, selling, and transferring without cumbersome paperwork or waiting periods. Every stock, every bond, every fund\u2014every asset\u2014can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn\u2019t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth. Perhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic. It can democratize access. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership. That means assets could be sliced into infinitely small pieces. This lowers one of the barriers to investing in valuable, previously inaccessible assets like private real estate and private equity. It can democratize shareholder voting. When you own a stock, you have a right to vote on the company\u2019s shareholder proposals. Tokenization makes that easier because your ownership and voting rights are digitally tracked, allowing you to vote seamlessly and securely from anywhere. It can democratize yield. Some investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns. One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs\u2014provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification. Financial transactions demand rigorous identity checks. Apple Pay and credit cards handle identity verification effortlessly, billions of times a day. Trade venues like NYSE and MarketAxess manage to do the same for buying and selling securities. But tokenized assets won\u2019t run through those traditional channels, meaning we need a new digital identity verification system. It sounds complex, but India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has already done it. Today, over 90% of Indians can securely verify transactions directly from their smartphones. [60] The takeaway is clear. If we\u2019re serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won\u2019t suffice. We must solve digital verification, too. Something worth expanding In 1761, about 80 years after Jonathan\u2019s Coffee House became the heartbeat of London\u2019s financial life, a group of 150 wealthy traders tried to close the gates. They offered Jonathan\u2019s owner \u00a31,200 per year\u2014about 10 years of wages for the average worker\u2014for exclusive use of the space during key trading hours. In essence, they wanted to create a private market. But London\u2019s broader community of investors wasn\u2019t having it. They protested, they argued their case in the courts, and after two years, they won. The markets had to remain open. Everybody could invest. [61] From our vantage point today, the history of finance can look like a long, steady march toward greater democracy\u2014more investors, broader participation, and expanded prosperity. And to a large extent, that\u2019s been the case. But this democratization was never guaranteed. It still isn\u2019t. Markets don\u2019t naturally evolve to serve everyone equally. They require relentless effort, conscious choices, and constant vigilance\u2014from those coffee-house protests centuries ago to today\u2019s complex debates over retirement policy, tokenization, infrastructure investment, and artificial intelligence. It\u2019s demanding work, but at BlackRock we\u2019ve been doing it for 37 years as fiduciaries to our clients. And not a single day has passed when it hasn\u2019t felt worth every bit of effort. Because no system human beings have ever devised has done more to generate wealth for more people than the capital markets. People invest their savings\u2014whether it\u2019s 50 guilders or $50,000\u2014and those investments become roads and schools, businesses and breakthrough technologies\u2014the things that power our economies, sending wealth rippling back to millions, allowing them to worry less about kitchen-table finances and spend more time simply enjoying life with their families. I\u2019ve always said investing is an act of hope\u2014that no one invests for the long term unless they believe the future will be better than the present. But that\u2019s not quite right. Investing isn\u2019t just an act of hope; investing is what makes our hopes, our reality. That\u2019s something worth protecting. That\u2019s something worth expanding. That\u2019s something worth democratizing. BlackRock\u2019s performance 2024-2025 Last fall, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock\u2019s initial public offering (IPO). When we went public, we had just 650 employees and our stock was listed at $14 a share. We managed $165 billion of primarily fixed income-based assets for our clients, and we had just started selling Aladdin\u2019s technology externally. Today, we manage $11.6 trillion for our clients, and Aladdin generates more than $1.6 billion in annual revenue. Our employee base is now almost 23,000 strong, with offices in more than 30 countries. Our stock ended 2024 at over $1,000 per share. But even 25 years since our IPO and 37 since our founding, this is in many ways just the beginning of the BlackRock story. 2024 was a milestone year for BlackRock. Clients entrusted us with a record $641 billion of net inflows. We added $1.5 trillion to AUM, and delivered record revenue and operating income, alongside a 29% total return for our shareholders. In a dynamic investing and re-risking environment, clients wanted to step back into the markets more actively. They did it with BlackRock. We closed the year with back-to-back record net inflow quarters, ending the year with $281 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter for 7% organic base fee growth. Importantly, that organic growth was broad-based across institutional, wealth, and regions. Clients want to consolidate more of their portfolios with a partner that is with them for the long term as they work toward their own commercial ambitions and portfolio goals. They want portfolios that are seamlessly integrated across public and private markets, that are dynamic, and that are underpinned by data, risk management and technology. This historic client activity took place as we executed on the most significant acquisitions we\u2019ve done since BGI more than 15 years ago. Our closings of GIP and Preqin, and planned acquisition of HPS later this year, are expected to scale and enhance our private markets investment and data capabilities. Clients have always been at the center of our strategy, and we\u2019ve intentionally invested to serve the full breadth of their needs. We have built a differentiated asset management and fintech platform that is fully integrated across both public and private markets. Following our planned acquisition of HPS, we expect BlackRock\u2019s alternatives platform to become a top five provider for clients, with $600 billion in client assets and over $3 billion in annual revenue. That will be integrated with BlackRock\u2019s platform that already houses the world\u2019s #1 global ETF franchise, $3 trillion in fixed income, a $700 billion insurance asset management practice, advisory services, and our proven Aladdin technology. Aladdin is powering a whole portfolio ecosystem across public and private markets with eFront and our recent acquisition of Preqin. This growing platform changes the complexion of BlackRock \u2013 one that we feel delivers for client needs and results in over 20% of our revenue base in long-dated, less market-sensitive products and services. Our revenue mix will continue to shift organically as private markets, technology and customized solutions experience higher secular growth. We believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater resilience through market cycles, and long-term value for shareholders. Clients have embraced our strategy. Our track record of successful acquisitions and integrations is deepening our clients\u2019 relationships with BlackRock. Our ETF franchise delivered record net inflows of $390 billion, which again led the industry. Since our acquisition of iShares, BlackRock has led in expanding the market for ETFs by delivering new asset classes like bonds or cryptocurrencies, alongside innovative investment products like active strategies in a more liquid and transparent vehicle. Approximately a quarter of our ETF net inflows were into products launched in the last five years. Our active ETFs delivered $22 billion in net inflows in 2024, while BlackRock\u2019s U.S.- based Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) was the largest exchange-traded product launch in history, growing to over $50 billion of AUM in less than a year. And it was the third-highest asset gatherer in the entire ETF industry, behind only S&P 500 index funds. We\u2019re innovating at the product and portfolio level and accelerating our distribution capabilities to deliver differentiated investment solutions. Client needs are driving industry consolidation, and investors increasingly prefer to work with BlackRock because of our capabilities as a scaled, multi-asset provider. We see this in the wealth channel, where managed model portfolios are the main way in which wealth managers are looking to grow their practices and better serve their clients. BlackRock has a leading models business, backed by our multi-asset, multi-product capabilities. We\u2019re also working across our wealth platform to provide increasingly personalized offerings to our financial advisor partners and their clients, including through customized separately managed accounts (SMAs). We offer index SMAs through Aperio, which had its fourth consecutive record year in 2024 with $14 billion of net inflows. And last year, we acquired SpiderRock Advisors, which offers tax-advantaged option overlay strategies, to grow our suite of customized offerings in the wealth channel. These clients include the world\u2019s largest asset owners, pension plans, and corporates, who are deepening ties to BlackRock. Many of these corporate partners see positive network effects to their core business, and to their own shareholders, by extending their relationships with BlackRock. Last year our clients entrusted us with more than $120 billion of scaled outsourcing mandates. The differentiated advice and alpha generation potential of our actively managed strategies continue to resonate with clients, driving more than $60 billion of active net inflows in 2024. Active flows were led by our LifePath target date franchise, outsourcing mandates, and our tech and data-driven systematic active equity strategies. We\u2019re delivering long-term investment performance, and we think active strategies can provide an advantage in an environment that requires a more dynamic approach to allocations. In fixed income, clients are turning to BlackRock to navigate a transitional rate environment, driving $164 billion of net inflows last year. We see a significant reallocation opportunity for the record $10 trillion of cash held on the sidelines, as many investors will need yields beyond the 4% currently earned in a money-market account in order to meet long-term goals like retirement. Our clients continue to increase their allocations to private markets as a source of diversification and uncorrelated alpha generation potential. Private markets net inflows of $9 billion included strong demand for infrastructure and private credit strategies. Client feedback surrounding the recent and planned acquisitions of GIP and HPS has exceeded even our own high expectations, and we expect these to drive significant future net inflows and revenue growth in 2025 and beyond. We\u2019ve delivered our Aladdin technology to clients for a little over 25 years now, and it only started following robust internal debate over whether to even offer it externally. It was a good decision for BlackRock and our clients. What we initially pioneered as our own internal risk-management tool is now the most comprehensive, fully integrated operating system in the industry. We signed some of our most significant mandates in Aladdin\u2019s history in 2024, and more than half of Aladdin sales included multiple products. Our acquisition of Preqin, which closed earlier this year, will add private markets data capabilities to our offering, with an aim to enable more transparency, and ultimately greater investability, within private markets. Our connectivity with clients is driving record results, and we\u2019re working across our platform to offer an even more comprehensive experience. Our structural growth businesses \u2013 ETFs, Aladdin, whole portfolio outsourcing, fixed income \u2013 are our strong foundations to serve clients and deliver on our through-the-cycle 5% organic base fee growth objectives. And in combination with our strategic moves in private markets and data, we\u2019ve positioned our business ahead of market opportunities that we think will define the future of asset management. Driving our next phase of growth As part of our ongoing work to assess our growth strategy, our management team and Board spends time throughout the year assessing what our industry and client opportunities will look like in the future. For example, five years from now, in 2030, what opportunities will drive differentiated growth? How will clients approach allocations and alpha generation in the portfolio of the future? We think the future of investing will include more integration across asset classes, and increasingly digital enablement. Our clients are already doing this. They\u2019re blending public and private investments, active and index, and they\u2019re looking to wrap all of that with leading data and analytics to better understand their portfolios. We\u2019re expanding our product and technology capability set across the whole portfolio to effectively serve our clients in the new and changing frontiers of asset management. When we acquired BGI 15 years ago, our move to blend active and index was a first for the industry; today, the combination of broad market exposures with outcome-oriented portfolios is an industry standard. Our inorganic moves last year aim to do the same by connecting public and private investments for our clients. Through GIP and soon, HPS, we\u2019ll combine scaled franchises in infrastructure and private credit with the global capabilities of our public markets platform. And the recent closing and integration of Preqin with Aladdin and eFront will better enable clients with more standardized and transparent data on the private markets. ETFs are a proven technology facilitating investment access, from retail investors making their first foray into the stock market, to the world\u2019s largest asset owners. The recent launch of our Bitcoin ETP is only the latest example, offering cryptocurrency exposure alongside the efficiency and price discovery features of an exchange-traded product wrapper. This is also expanding our presence with more investors. More than half of demand for our Bitcoin ETP has been from retail investors, and three-quarters of those investors had never owned an iShares product before. And just this year, we\u2019ve expanded access to Bitcoin through a convenient exchange-traded wrapper with launches in Canada and Europe. Similarly, ETFs are facilitating growth of an investing culture in Europe. As first-time investors begin to enter the capital markets, it\u2019s often through ETFs, and particularly iShares. Only one-third of European individuals have capital markets investments, compared to more than 60% of Americans. Not only are they not participating in the growth potential offered by the broader capital markets, but they\u2019re also often losing out on a real return as low interest rates in bank savings accounts are outpaced by inflation. We\u2019re working with established players plus several newer entrants in Europe, including Monzo, N26, Revolut, Scalable Capital, and Trade Republic, to lower the barriers to investing and build financial knowledge in local markets. With our now more than $1 trillion European ETF platform, which is larger than the next five issuers combined, we see a tremendous opportunity to grow our regional offerings and help more individuals reach their financial goals through the capital markets. We\u2019re also laying the groundwork to enable future growth as countries look to build out their own capital markets. I\u2019ve spent time in the Middle East and Asia already this year, and the development of more robust and prosperous local capital markets has been central to many of my discussions with local leaders. In Saudi Arabia, we\u2019re partnering with the Public Investment Fund to encourage investment and further develop their local capital markets. And in India, our joint venture Jio BlackRock is preparing to launch a digitally enabled asset management and wealth platform. Our world-class talent is central to our decades of growth and sustained performance. We regularly evaluate our talent strategy to make sure we are developing well-rounded leaders with a breadth of experience across our business. Earlier this year, we elevated several of our leaders to new roles across the firm. After 20 years building a number of businesses at BlackRock, Mark Wiedman has decided to pursue the next chapter in his career outside of the firm. Mark has helped shape the BlackRock we know today, including his work leading iShares, Corporate Strategy, and most recently our Global Client Business. Mark is a great friend of mine, and I\u2019m personally thankful to him for his contributions to the firm. I\u2019m proud of the deep leadership team we\u2019ve assembled, and our recent and pending acquisitions will bring an influx of top talent to our firm. Across our entire platform, we\u2019re positioning our people to deliver value for our clients and power our business into the future. Our Board of Directors BlackRock\u2019s Board has always been critical to our success and growth. They\u2019re also instrumental as we shape our forward strategy and expand into newer markets and businesses. Every year, we review our Board composition to ensure we have the right breadth of backgrounds and experience to advise on BlackRock\u2019s operations, strategy and management. We\u2019re happy to have welcomed Bayo Ogunlesi to our Board of Directors last fall following the closing of the GIP transaction. We\u2019re already benefiting from his wealth of experience in private markets as we scale our capabilities in this fast-growing market. In March of this year, our Board voted unanimously to nominate Gregory Fleming, Chief Executive Officer of Rockefeller Capital Management, and Kathleen Murphy, former President of Personal Investing at Fidelity Investments, to stand for election at our annual meeting. Greg and Kathy bring a tremendous amount of experience in financial services and wealth management, and I believe they\u2019ll both provide differentiated perspectives to our Board. At the same time, we are fortunate to have had Marco Antonio Slim Domit, who will not be standing for re-election this year, as a director of BlackRock. Tony\u2019s service was defined by his ability to leverage his experience in investment across regions to offer keen insights that improved the Board\u2019s decision making and, ultimately, BlackRock itself. We are grateful for his service, and he will be missed by the entire Board and by the BlackRock leadership team. BlackRock\u2019s Board will continue to guide our company to invest and innovate, all with the aim to better serve our clients, employees, and shareholders. When we went public, it was with belief in the importance of growth and depth in the capital markets. We wanted to share our success with a broader population of people investing for the future, including our employees. That all still holds today. We entered 2025 at our strongest inflection point, and I see greater opportunities ahead for BlackRock, our clients, and our shareholders than ever before. 1 My thanks to Dr. Lodewijk Petram, author of The World\u2019s First Stock Exchange (Columbia University Press, 2014), for his invaluable assistance unpacking the history of early stock markets \u2014 including locating the original Dutch text listing the professions of Amsterdam\u2019s first investors: Het oudste aandeelhoudersregister van de Kamer Amsterdam der Oost-Indische Compagnie, edited by J.G. van Dillen (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1958) (go back) 2 R.

By applying an incremental net-of-fee outperformance (alpha) of 50 basis points (0.50%) per annum over this entire period, the portfolio accumulates approximately 14.5% more wealth by retirement age (65), compared to a similar portfolio without this incremental alpha. Using LifePath\u2019s spending calculation\u2014which assumes a conservative retirement portfolio allocation of 40% equities and 60% fixed income\u2014this increased wealth accumulation translates directly into the capacity for an estimated nine additional years of retirement spending at the individual\u2019s retirement-year salary level, all else equal (go back) 42 New York University School of Law, \u201cWho\u2019s Left to Tax?

Self-regulatory body to fix guardrails for growing influencer marketing business Top names in India\u2019s influencer marketing ecosystem have joined forces to establish the India Influencer Governing Council (IIGC) , a new self-regulatory body to bring structure and accountability to the rapidly growing digital content space.

Who\u2019s involved: The IIGC comprises representatives from leading organisations such as Hindustan Unilever, Publicis, Google, and Meta, alongside some of the country\u2019s most prominent influencers. Tell me more: The council has introduced a \u2018Code of Standards\u2019 designed to ensure influencer content remains legal, transparent, ethical, and socially responsible. While focusing on influencers, the IIGC is also developing similar guidelines for brands, platforms, agencies, and consumers. What else: To boost transparency, the IIGC has introduced \u2018India Influencer Ratings\u2019, a weekly ranking inspired by TV viewership metrics. Released every Tuesday, it will highlight: Top 5 Trendsetters Top 5 Underdogs (emerging talent) Top 5 Violators (a \"Don\u2019t Do That\" list) Top 5 Brands ETtech Explainer: How Karnataka\u2019s gig worker tax could change the app economy Karnataka is considering a differential tax on app-based services to fund social security for gig and platform workers . This move could set a precedent for gig economy regulations in other states and at the national level. Details: The state plans to introduce category-wise fees on app-based platforms such as ride-hailing, food delivery, and ecommerce to finance welfare schemes for gig workers. The labour department is finalising the framework, which will likely be placed before the cabinet soon. Platforms may be required to contribute a fixed share of each transaction towards a dedicated welfare fund. Also Read: Karnataka may levy differential fee on app-based services to fund gig workers welfare Taxman opens the parcel: GST sleuths probe restaurant packaging charges Several restaurants listed on platforms like Zomato have received summons from the GST department seeking details on GST paid for packaging charges since 1 January 2022. What\u2019s happening: The latest summons focus on GST compliance related to packaging charges. While customers pay this fee, tax officials are investigating whether the collected amount was remitted to the state government\u2014and when. This follows an ongoing dispute over whether food delivery platforms should pay GST on delivery fees. Last year, Zomato received a tax demand of Rs 803 crore from the GST office over this issue. Expert opinion: Ashish Karundia, founder of the eponymous CA firm Ashish Karundia & Co, explained that under GST law, bundled services (two or more goods or services supplied together) are usually treated as a single supply. However, if the packaging is billed separately, it may be classified as a distinct supply, making restaurants liable for GST. Meta faces historic antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram, WhatsApp Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Meta Meta begins a landmark antitrust trial on Monday that could compel the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, both acquired more than a decade ago. The context: Filed in 2020 during Donald Trump's first term, the lawsuit by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges Meta\u2014then Facebook\u2014bought the platforms to stifle competition and build a monopoly. FTC\u2019s argument: The agency claims Meta followed its CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2008 strategy: \u201cIt is better to buy than compete.\u201d According to the FTC, the company allegedly targeted emerging rivals for acquisition and deliberately hindered smaller competitors to \u201cneutralise perceived competitive threats.\u201d Company response: \u201c\u2026Regulators should be supporting American innovation rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company stated.

From mobile games to social media apps and even online shopping, these simple gestures often lead to rewards\u2014be it a new level unlocked, a burst of likes, or a shiny badge for completing a task. But why are these actions so addictive? What is it about tapping and swiping for rewards that keeps us coming back for more? The answer lies in the fascinating interplay of psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral design, which taps into the very core of human motivation. The Dopamine Rush: Our Brain\u2019s Reward System At the heart of our love for tapping and swiping is dopamine, the brain\u2019s feel-good neurotransmitter. Dopamine is released when we anticipate a reward, creating a sense of pleasure and motivation. Every time you swipe to refresh your social media feed or tap to open a loot box in a game, your brain is primed for a potential hit of excitement. This anticipation is key\u2014it\u2019s not just the reward itself but the possibility of it that keeps us hooked. This mechanism is no accident. App and game designers carefully craft experiences to trigger dopamine release. The unpredictability of rewards, known as variable reward schedules, is particularly powerful. You don\u2019t know if the next swipe will reveal a viral post, a rare in-game item, or a generic ad, and that uncertainty fuels curiosity. This concept is borrowed from slot games , where players keep pulling the lever in hopes of hitting the jackpot, even though the outcome is random. The Power of Instant Gratification Humans are wired to seek instant gratification, a trait rooted in our evolutionary past when immediate rewards\u2014like food or shelter\u2014were critical for survival. Tapping and swiping cater to this instinct by delivering quick, bite-sized outcomes. Unlike long-term goals that require patience, these actions provide instant feedback: a notification ping, a colorful animation, or a point tally climbing higher. This immediacy is amplified by the tactile nature of touchscreens. The physical act of tapping or swiping feels intuitive and engaging, creating a seamless loop between action and reward. Studies suggest that touch-based interactions increase emotional engagement compared to clicking with a mouse, making mobile devices the perfect medium for reward-driven behaviors. Gamification: Turning Tasks into Play Another reason we\u2019re drawn to tapping and swiping is gamification\u2014the art of applying game-like elements to non-game contexts. Apps like Duolingo, Fitbit, or even Starbucks\u2019 rewards program use points, streaks, and leaderboards to make mundane tasks feel like a game. Swiping to log a workout or tapping to claim a free coffee transforms routine actions into mini-quests with tangible payoffs. Gamification leverages our desire for achievement and social validation. When we earn a badge or climb a leaderboard, we feel a sense of progress and status. Social media platforms take this further by tying rewards to social interactions\u2014likes, comments, and shares become digital high-fives that boost our self-esteem. The act of swiping through stories or tapping to like a post isn\u2019t just about consuming content; it\u2019s about chasing those micro-moments of validation. The Illusion of Control Tapping and swiping also give us a sense of control in an unpredictable world. Each gesture feels like an active choice, even if the outcome is determined by an algorithm. This illusion of control is a powerful motivator. In psychology, it\u2019s linked to the concept of self-efficacy\u2014the belief that our actions can influence results. When you tap to spin a virtual wheel or swipe to match tiles, you feel like you\u2019re driving the action, even if the system is rigged to keep you engaged. This mirrors the appeal of slot machines, where pulling the lever creates a fleeting sense of agency. The randomness of the reward is cloaked in the act of participation, making it feel earned rather than arbitrary. App designers borrow heavily from this playbook, ensuring that every tap or swipe feels meaningful, even when the stakes are low. The Dark Side: When Tapping Becomes Compulsive While tapping and swiping can be fun and rewarding, there\u2019s a flip side. The same psychological triggers that make these actions enjoyable can lead to compulsive behavior. The variable reward system, combined with endless content streams, can trap users in a cycle of seeking the next hit. Social media \u201cdoomscrolling\u201d or excessive gaming are examples of how these mechanics can hijack attention, sometimes at the expense of mental health or productivity. Research from the University of Cambridge (2023) suggests that excessive use of reward-based apps can overstimulate the brain\u2019s reward pathways, leading to diminished satisfaction over time. What starts as a quick tap to check notifications can spiral into hours lost, as the brain chases diminishing returns. Awareness of these patterns is crucial for maintaining a healthy balance. Why We Keep Coming Back Ultimately, our love for tapping and swiping boils down to how these actions align with our psychological wiring. They offer instant gratification, a sense of control, and the thrill of unpredictable rewards\u2014all wrapped in a tactile, user-friendly package. By borrowing techniques from gambling and gaming, like those seen in slot games, designers create experiences that are hard to resist. But understanding the psychology behind these behaviors empowers us to engage more mindfully. The next time you find yourself swiping through a feed or tapping for a virtual reward, take a moment to notice the pull. It\u2019s not just a habit\u2014it\u2019s a carefully orchestrated dance between your brain and the screen, choreographed to keep you coming back for more. By recognizing these triggers, we can enjoy the fun of tapping and swiping without letting it take over. After all, the real reward is staying in control of our own attention.

He\u2019s cited the example of Apple making iPhones in the US, and even recently claimed that the company plans to do so. Apple has explained many times why it simply wouldn\u2019t be practical to do this, with CEO Tim Cook doing so a full decade ago . Analysts, supply-chain experts, and a former Apple engineer have all added their weight to the view that it simply isn\u2019t possible, and wouldn\u2019t help even if it were \u2026 Tim Cook said way back in 2015 that the time when the US was capable of manufacturing at this kind of scale is long gone. China put an enormous focus on manufacturing. The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we\u2019re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. The best that could happen is \u201cfinal screw engineering,\u201d where Apple ships essentially-completed iPhones to the US and then applies one or two finishing touches here in order to claim this as the country of manufacture. The company has previously used this tactic in Brazil . Analysts weigh in A number of experts have been weighing in on the unrealistic nature of Trump\u2019s dream, with an analyst pointing first to the incredible costs involved. Dan Ives, analyst at US financial firm Wedbush Securities, [\u2026] warned The Guardian that the cost of entirely moving iPhone production to Apple\u2019s home country would be prohibitive for the company \u2013 and customers. \u201cThe reality is it would take three years and $30bn in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to investors this week. \u201cFor US consumers the reality of a $1,000 iPhone being one of the best made consumer products on the planet would disappear.\u201d He added that if the phones were solely US-made then the cost would more than treble. \u201cIf consumers want a $3,500 iPhone we should make them in New Jersey or Texas or another state.\u201d US investment bank Evercore echoes Cook\u2019s past comments on the sheer impracticality. \u201cThe US economy is not set up to be able to assemble mobile phones. They don\u2019t have the facilities or the flexible labour,\u201d he said. \u201cTo train 200,000-300,000 people to come in and assemble iPhones is simply not practical.\u201d A former Apple engineer too Top comment by Eric Liked by 9 people The USA shouldn\u2019t be worried about assembling iPhones in America, they should be worried about creating a supply chain and trained engineers for the next generation of weapons they\u2019re going to need to carry out any sort of foreign policy without relying on rare earths and other material from China. They should be worried about creating a supply chain to equip hospitals to fight the next pandemic which most experts agree is a question of when not if without relying on supplies from China. The USA shouldn\u2019t be worried about manufacturing toasters and dishwashers in America they should be worried about educating young people to think clearly and rationally so they can make the difficult decisions in the coming age of AI. View all comments Arstechnica also cites a former Apple engineer agreeing. Former Apple manufacturing engineer, Matthew Moore, told Bloomberg that \u201cthere are millions of people employed by the Apple supply chain in China,\u201d and Apple has long insisted that the US talent pool is too small to easily replace them. \u201cWhat city in America is going to put everything down and build only iPhones?\u201d Moore said. \u201cBoston is over 500,000 people. The whole city would need to stop everything and start assembling iPhones.\u201d Even if US assembly could somehow be made possible, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be remotely feasible to replicate Apple\u2019s entire Chinese supply chain comprising thousands of companies, so the company would still be importing all of the components \u2013 and paying tariffs on those. The reality is that what Trump wants is impossible, and his threats will eventually be proven empty ones .

Apple has a market capitalization of $3 trillion \u2014 meaning the almost 7% jump it saw in premarket trading translates into a staggering $200 billion increase in market capitalization.

That number is nearly equivalent to the GDP of Greece or New Zealand. And because Apple is the largest by weight in the S&P 500, the ripple effect of a move like this can sway the entire index. Advertisement When Apple moves almost 7%, it\u2019s not just a stock story \u2014 it\u2019s a seismic event for global markets. Advertisement Tariffs whiplash tech industry On Monday afternoon, Trump left the door open to Apple receiving temporary tariff exemptions on products manufactured in China. Advertisement \u201cI\u2019m a very flexible person,\u201d Trump said in the White House in response to a reporter\u2019s question about potential exemptions for Apple products. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Tim Cook.\u201d Other tech companies exposed to Chinese manufacturing, including Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Dell ( DELL ), both also rallied on Monday. Nvidia was up 0.3%, while Dell climbed 4.8%. Advertisement But the celebration may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned that smartphones and similar devices are still slated to be included in a forthcoming semiconductor-focused tariff round \u201ccoming in probably a month or two.\u201d Trump echoed that ambiguity on social media, insisting no product was actually exempt and calling the change a simple reclassification. Advertisement \u201cLook, there is no tariff policy. It\u2019s just all chaos and corruption. That\u2019s all we have going on,\u201d Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said during a TV appearance Sunday. Wall Street analysts say the muddled messaging adds to investor unease, particularly for companies with deep supply chain ties to China. The bottom line: The exemptions may delay pain, but they don\u2019t erase it. Advertisement iPhone dominance endures Even amid policy uncertainty, Apple\u2019s core business continues to flex its strength. The company retook the global top spot in smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025, buoyed by strong demand for the iPhone 16e in Japan and India.

The story is witty, filled with religious references and commentary on 1960s culture. The sprightly soundtrack features well-chosen soul, krautrock, and pop. Why, then, does this series not rank amongst the best things to air on TV this year? The problem isn\u2019t lead actor (and executive producer) David Oyelowo . As inventor, father, husband, former check-forger, and recent ex-con Hampton Chambers, he anchors the proceedings with a bouncy, almost evangelical optimism. Having found God in prison, Hampton is determined to walk a righteous path upon his return to his family in Chatsworth, California, armed with his prison-workshop-assembled invention: a self-sharpening drill that will revolutionize machining. That a little prison riot causes a hiccup in his plan of economic and emotional salvation doesn\u2019t stop him; he\u2019s gotta go where he\u2019s going. To his unbridled surprise, Hampton\u2019s return home is met with cool indifference, bordering on antipathy. After opening the door to her husband, Astoria (a winning Simone Missick) denies him an embrace and promptly pours herself a drink. Of their two sons, only Einstein (Evan Ellison, hilarious) seems glad to see him, though that may have more to do with his general head-in-the-clouds personality, including ignoring full scholarships to Harvard and MIT in favor of building a backyard pool and joining a pole vault team in Oregon; Harrison (Jahi Di\u2019Allo Winston) is visibly angry, resentful of both his father\u2019s abandonment and his bizarre good cheer. In rapid succession, Hampton, realizing familial forgiveness will be hard to come by, vows to make dinner every night, earn a living, and stay on the straight and narrow. Complications to these goals are introduced in rapid succession: His juvie buddy Boosie (scene-stealer Bokeem Woodbine) informs him that Hampton\u2019s timely release from prison was due to strings pulled by the Prevost Brothers, a Quebecois gang of seven criminal siblings. Youngest brother Jean-Guy (Louis Cancelmi, doing a lot with very little) has designs on Hampton\u2019s drill and loyalty. In addition to the existential threat posed by the French-Canadians, they also demand financial remuneration, which means Hampton will have to resume some light criminal activities. That straight and narrow path is starting to look more winding than he\u2019d expected. On this path are odd strangers, delivering messages that may or may not be from a higher power. While pursuing his wife and her new boyfriend Ronald, Hampton runs into Edith (Sunita Mani), whose hand is stuck inside a vent. Their conversation is deep, yet friendly, but she seems to know way too much about him and his predicament. A nameless man warns Hampton to not take what is not his. The visual and philosophical stylings of \u201cGovernment Cheese\u201d are heavily influenced by the Coen Brothers. Were the series trimmed down, it could pass as a remake of \u201cA Serious Man,\u201d complete with religious parables and omens drenched in black comedy. Other episodes that focus on supporting characters look right out of the Wes Anderson playbook, including a gravelly voiceover, whip-fast camera movement, and use of the Futura font for on-screen text. There\u2019s also plenty of texture in Warren Alan Young\u2019s production design. Each setting, like the Chambers home and the office where Astoria works as an aspiring interior design associate, possess a vibrant color palette, appropriate mid-century modern furniture. And I\u2019m grateful for the series\u2019 prioritization of the interiority of characters like Astoria, who was once full of hope, but is now just watching other people live the life she once envisioned for herself, while various appliances in her home, not to mention her dreams, are literally falling to pieces. Nancy Steiner\u2019s costume design helps tell her story too; in flashbacks, Astoria wore bright red dresses, thrilled by the promise of her new family home in Chatsworth, while Hampton dressed in confident shades of blue. In the present, Astoria\u2019s elation has dimmed into pinks and pastels (and some paisley), while Hampton continues to dress in the blues of his past. So what\u2019s the problem? Why does a series with this many terrific ingredients not result in a delicious dish? \u201cGovernment Cheese\u201d is by no means the high-budget display of mediocrity we\u2019ve seen from other high-profile Apple projects. There\u2019s a lot about it I loved and enjoyed, but it suffers from the same problem as so many other prestige TV shows: were this a two-hour film, it could be brilliant. Dragging out a high-concept surrealist comedy to 10 episodes cannot help but dull its impact. There are so many spinning plates in the plot that a few simply have to come crashing down, and by the time the final scene rolls, what felt like a confident absurdist take on a black family in 1960s America feels empty, deflated. Given Hollywood\u2019s obsession with making $200 million movies, I can\u2019t even lay blame at the feet of co-creators Paul Hunter and Ayesha Carr. It\u2019s a damn shame that the model we\u2019ve arrived at is \u201cWell, if enough people watch it, maybe they can turn it around in Season Two.\u201d Entire series screened for review.

Oops, something went wrong Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Upgrade Now Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) the Top Stock in Ken Griffin\u2019s Portfolio to Buy According to Analysts? Neha Gupta Mon, Apr 14, 2025, 6:08 AM 6 min read In This Article: TSM -0.79% We recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks in Ken Griffin\u2019s Portfolio to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other top stocks in Ken Griffin\u2019s portfolio to buy according to analysts. Ken Griffin is one billionaire investor wary of the negative impact of US President Donald Trump\u2019s combative approach to trade policy. Aggressive trade tariffs in the push to try and settle trade imbalances between the US and other nations have sent shockwaves in the equity markets. Likewise, Griffin believes the damage has already been done, given that the broader equity market has already pulled back significantly since Trump assumed office on January 20, 2025. \u201cFrom my vantage point, the bombastic rhetoric, the damage has already been done,\u201d Griffin said Tuesday at the UBS Financial Services Conference in Key Biscayne, Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake to resort to this form of rhetoric when you\u2019re trying to drive a bargain because \u2026 it tears into the minds of CEOs, policymakers that we can\u2019t depend upon America, as our trading partner.\u201d The billionaire hedge fund manager\u2019s remarks followed Trump\u2019s signing of an order imposing 25% import duties on steel and aluminum. According to Ken Griffin, Trump\u2019s trade policies have the potential to affect long-term investments for multinational companies. Companies are increasingly slowing down their investments, especially abroad, worried about the long-term impact of trade tariffs. READ ALSO: Top 10 Growth Stocks in David Tepper\u2019s Portfolio and Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 13 Growth Stock Picks . \u201cIt makes it difficult for multinationals, in particular, to think about how to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, particularly when it comes to long lead time capital investments that could be adversely impacted by a degradation of the current terms of engagement as amongst the leading Western countries when it comes to terms and trade,\u201d he said. The remarks come on the Fed opting to go slow on interest rate cuts for the second straight meeting after conducting three consecutive rate reductions beginning September 2024. The central bank opted to maintain the benchmark rate at 4.5%, wary of inflation ticking higher amid the ongoing trade war between the US and other countries. According to the US central bank, GDP growth will slow in 2025, and core inflation will be higher. This partially reflects the anticipated effects of the retaliatory actions and newly imposed U.S. tariffs. The US central bank is going slow on interest rate cuts, and the warning of a potential economic growth slowdown has rattled the equity markets. Story Continues After years of blockbuster gains, the S&P 500 has pulled back significantly from record highs. Investors remain wary of the uncertainties triggered by the ongoing trade war and its potential impact, especially on economic growth. It remains to be seen if Citadel Investment Group will continue to average the 19% gain it has accrued annually over the years amid the choppy markets. Amid the concerns, billionaire investor Ken Griffin remains bullish on some equity plays he believes are well-positioned to benefit amid the current investment environment. While Griffin\u2019s investment portfolio in Citadel Investment Group boasts significant exposure to tech stocks, its $577.87 billion portfolio value also boasts significant stakes in the services healthcare and basic materials sector. The diversification play is one of Griffin \u2019s investment strategies focusing on identifying and investing in equities expected to provide strong performance relative to the benchmark index. As co-chief investment officer and executive chairman, Griffin plays an active role in the hedge fund\u2019s investment strategy. Our Methodology We combed Citadel Investment Group\u2019s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify the top 10 stocks in Ken Griffin\u2019s portfolio to buy, according to analysts. From the resultant data, we settled on the top 10 picks trading at significant discounts but with significant upside potential (more than 40%), according to Wall Street Analysts (as of April 11). Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential while also detailing hedge fund sentiments regarding the stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) the Top Stock in Ken Griffin\u2019s Portfolio to Buy According to Analysts? A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 186 Stock Upside Potential as of April 11: 59.35% Citadel Investment Group\u2019s Equity Stakes: $241,327,843 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a tech giant focusing on developing and producing advanced chips for some big tech companies. Its biggest clients include Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, affirming a reliable business and revenue stream. According to analysts, TSM is one of the top stocks in Ken Griffin\u2019s portfolio to buy due to its solid growth prospects amid growing demand for chips for artificial intelligence workloads. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported revenue of $26.9 billion for Q4 2024, reflecting a 37% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Full-year revenue was up 30% to just over $90 billion. It expects its first quarter 2025 revenues to range between $25 billion and $25.8 billion. On the other hand, management expects revenue to grow by an average of 20% annually over the next five years. Additionally, gross margin is expected to reach 58% in the upcoming quarter, a notable rise from the 53.1% recorded in the same quarter last year. In the long term, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) predicts that revenue from artificial intelligence (AI) chips will likely grow at an average of 40% over the next five years. Overall, TSM ranks 9th on our list of top stocks in Ken Griffin\u2019s portfolio to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

We have previously reported that the iPhone Fold will feature an internal display of 7.76 inches, and today, a leaker shared details on the resolution of the inner and outer screens. Apple's foldable iPhone leak suggests sharper display resolution with an under-screen camera for an intrusion-free experience Apple's forthcoming foldable iPhone, also rumored as the iPhone Fold, will feature two screens in a book-style design. A Chinese leaker who goes by the name of Digital Chat Station claims that the inner display will be 7.76 inches with a resolution of 2,713 x 1,920 and an in-display \"under-screen camera technology.\" The outer 5.49-inch display will have a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution, but unlike the inner display, it will have a punch-hole camera. Related Story Apple\u2019s Foldable iPhone Will Have An Under-Screen Camera, But Will Not House All The TrueDepth Components Necessary For Enabling Face ID, Claims Tipster The leaker also previously claimed that the iPhone Fold will have a 4:3 aspect ratio for the inner display and leaked the dimensions of the display. Prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also corroborated these findings and added that the inner display will be free of any creases, which has been a major point of concern for Apple since early rumors emerged. However, there have been no reports suggesting that the inner display will have an in-display camera sensor, making it the first. It is possible that Apple puts the Dynamic Island on the outer display of the iPhone Fold for faster authentication. This could be why the company is opting for a hole-punch on the outer display rather than on the inside. However, Apple could ditch Face ID altogether for the Fold, opting for a more traditional Touch ID solution, possibly in the Power Button. It was previously reported that Apple is also working on a large 18.8-inch foldable iPad , and the leaker previously claimed that the device will feature the new in-display Face ID sensors for authentication purposes. If the news has any heft, the foldable iPad running macOS could be the first to get under-screen Face ID sensors. Kuo also believes that Apple will let go of Face ID for its iPhone Fold, but it remains to be seen if the company will opt for Touch ID in the Power Button, like the iPad Air lineup, or put an in-display sensor similar to the Galaxy S25 lineup. It is believed that Apple will launch its first foldable iPhone by the end of next year with a price tag of as much as $2,000 . According to analyst Jeff Pu, the device has already entered the New Product Introduction phase. We will share more details on the iPhone Fold as we get closer to the launch. Would you upgrade to the foldable iPhone if it costs $2,000 or more?

Late Friday, US Customs and Border Protection released a list of products excluded from both the 125% China-specific tariff and the broader 10% global tariff. This includes smartphones, laptops, hard drives, processors, and memory chips\u2014most of which are central to Apple\u2019s product line. Even so, Apple wouldn\u2019t have escaped untouched. It would still face a 20% \u201cfentanyl tariff,\u201d as President Trump highlighted on Truth Social . That would\u2019ve meant a total of 145% in tariffs on some Chinese tech goods. But for now, Apple products only face the 20% fentanyl-specific tariff. Don\u2019t take this break for granted, though. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made it clear this isn\u2019t a permanent pass. In a conversation with ABC News , he said tech products will fall under a \u201cspecial focus type of tariff,\u201d which includes the iPhone. Trump backed that up, saying semiconductors and the full electronics supply chain will soon face new scrutiny. What that means in real terms: another tariff announcement is likely coming soon, and the tech industry isn\u2019t exempt. Whether the final rate ends up being lower than 125% remains to be seen. The right time to buy your favourite Apple product is now In the meantime, Apple is expected to dodge some of the impact by shifting more US-bound production to India and Vietnam. Some recent Macs, like the M4 MacBook Air and M3 Ultra Mac Studio, already come out of Vietnam. However, nobody knows how much of Apple\u2019s manufacturing can realistically move outside of China. The company might be able to reroute part of its supply chain, but it\u2019s unlikely to do that for every product in time. The bottom line is simple: the tariff pause is brief, the impact is uncertain, and if you\u2019re planning to buy an Apple device anytime soon, you probably shouldn\u2019t wait. As Trump put it, no one\u2019s getting off the hook. Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Following the completion of that project, the group was essentially disbanded as a coherent body, with constituent parts reshuffled under other reporting lines within the company. Vision boss Mike Rockwell took over the Siri brief from John Giannandrea, while the group\u2019s hardware and software engineers are now spread out across multiple teams. All this change might seem disruptive, and has reportedly led to fears of layoffs, but Apple is keeping its Vision-focused employees busy. And in the latest installment of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reveals that the team is still working on not one but two new headsets to follow up on Vision Pro\u2019s critical success but commercial failure. The first is an obvious attempt to address the two obstacles preventing Vision Pro from achieving widespread adoption: its high price tag and substantial physical bulk. \u201cThe new plan is to release a model that makes the headset both lighter and cheaper,\u201d Gurman writes, noting that the first-gen Vision Pro version weighs almost 1.5 pounds and has received almost universal criticism about neck strain. He doesn\u2019t explain how Apple will make the device lighter, though it will presumably turn to a different material than the original model\u2019s aluminum frame or cut down on the size. He also fails to share details on how the price will come down, particularly in light of the current tariff turmoil. These, then, are obvious upgrades Apple was always going to attempt if it went ahead with plans for a sequel to Vision Pro. A more interesting prediction is Gurman\u2019s claim that a second headset will be designed specifically for use with a Mac. \u201cIn January, I reported that Apple had scrapped work on augmented reality glasses that would tether to a Mac. Instead, it\u2019s now working on a Vision Pro that plugs into a Mac,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe idea is to create an ultra-low-latency system for streaming a user\u2019s Mac display or for connecting to high-end enterprise applications. Some customers have been using the Vision Pro for things like viewing imaging during surgery or for flight simulators. Those are two areas where a user would want the least amount of lag possible\u2013something that can\u2019t be guaranteed by a fully wireless system.\u201d Apple already offers a feature that lets Vision Pro users wirelessly access their Mac\u2019s display wirelessly , though the problems above have limited its success . However, a headset designed to plug into a Mac would likely be significantly cheaper and lighter and could be marketed as a pro accessory rather than a high-priced standalone item. Ultimately, Gurman insists, Apple wants to create its long-awaited augmented-reality glasses, with an extremely low weight and discreet profile. He notes that Tim Cook is \u201chell-bent on creating an industry-leading product before Meta can,\u201d but it\u2019s still \u201cmany years\u201d from launch. However, the two headsets currently in development could serve as a useful stopgap before the company gets there.

REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli Trump\u2019s Tangled Tariffs Sow Confusion as Negotiators Line Up Bloomberg Total Views: 0 April 14, 2025 Share this article By Shawn Donnan, Josh Wingrove and Mackenzie Hawkins Apr 14, 2025 (Bloomberg) \u2013President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff exclusions for smartphones and other tech products have added to a growing set of confusing signals for companies and trading partners digesting how to engage a White House still promising to negotiate dozens of new deals in America\u2019s favor. The dizzying weekend saw Trump exclude popular consumer electronics from 125% tariffs on China and a 10% baseline global tariff. The move exempted more than $101 billion in US imports from China alone and was seen as a short-term win for US tech champions like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Trump and top aides on Sunday, though, declared that the reprieve was only a procedural maneuver to ultimately hit those tech products with a different, sector-specific tariff. For financial markets handicapping the economic spillovers, that again made finding clarity hard in a strategy the White House insists is carefully constructed but critics see as subject to the whims of a transactional president. For countries sending delegations to Washington to negotiate \u2014 like the European Union\u2019s trade chief is aiming to do Monday \u2014 fresh questions arose about whether talking is even the best approach. And for international companies operating in an environment where rules can change overnight, inactivity during the turmoil is emerging as the safest bet. \u2018Act First\u2019 \u201cThe Trump team continues to follow an approach of act first, then make adjustments as needed,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade negotiator who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cThis approach contributes to more unpredictability for investors and our trading partners, who may no longer conclude that rushing to negotiate with the US is the best approach.\u201d Trump is hailing a flurry of negotiations aimed at locking in reduced country-by-country tariffs, which he has long said he won\u2019t apply to sectors that have their own levies. Such duties have already been rolled out for autos, steel, and aluminum. More national security investigations that would lead to tariffs are expected in the weeks ahead on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other vital sectors. \u201cWe are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\u201d Trump said in a social media post Sunday. \u201cWhat has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.\u201d China\u2019s government said the US decision to exempt certain consumer electronics was a small step and called for abolishing tariffs altogether. President Xi Jinping is heading to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week to shore up relationships in the region. Read more: Xi Seeks to Win Over Southeast Asia as Trump Pauses Some Tariffs In Washington, the frenetic weekend shifts further muddy the water \u2014 even if Trump\u2019s administration had long flagged some of them. While Trump has indicated he will haggle over country rates, questions are now emerging over whether the sectoral tariffs are up for bargaining as well. \u201cThose are not available for negotiation,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Hours later, however, Trump signaled an openness to talks with companies over the scope of his semiconductor tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing it, but we\u2019ll also talk to companies,\u201d he told reporters on the plane flying back from Florida. \u201cYou have to show a certain flexibility.\u201d Fueling Inactivity The White House\u2019s messaging is creating more uncertainty for companies dependent on imports to the US. \u201cThe whole system seems designed to create paralysis,\u201d Ryan Petersen, the founder and CEO of digital freight platform Flexport Inc., wrote in a social media post Sunday. Tobias Meyer, chief executive officer of cargo and logistics giant DHL Group, said companies trying to conform with constantly shifting US directives \u201cdon\u2019t know even if something\u2019s announced, whether two days later it\u2019s not changed again.\u201d \u201cYou really see some fatigue of decision makers in manufacturing and also in the distribution sector,\u201d Meyer said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview . \u201cI hear a lot that customers simply say, \u2018we\u2019ll wait for now.\u2019\u201d The economic fallout of such a freezing up of trade could be wide. On Monday, Singapore\u2019s trade ministry downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year, saying businesses and consumers may \u201cadopt a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approach before making spending decisions.\u201d Diplomats and other officials who\u2019ve sought to engage in talks with the US are similarly unsure about how best to proceed. Bond Market Signals In the wake of Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of his new tariffs, senior administration officials publicly insisted there wouldn\u2019t be any negotiations over his border levies. Trump\u2019s goal of repatriating manufacturing was an inviolable priority, they said, and the purpose of the duties imposed in the name of reducing a trade deficit that Trump has declared a national emergency. The weekend pullback on tech tariffs was the second major adjustment to Trump\u2019s duty regime in a matter of days. On April 9, the same day new duties unveiled the week before went into effect on dozens of countries, Trump abruptly reduced them all to 10% for 90 days \u2014 except for China \u2014 amid rapidly increasing concerns about a bond market selloff. There are also growing signs that the tariffs and the growing odds of a recession that have come with them are politically unpopular. Read more: Treasuries Suddenly Trade Like Risky Assets in Warning to Trump A CBS poll published Sunday found that a plurality of Americans expect Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have raised the US\u2019s average applied duties to their highest level in more than a century, to hurt their financial situation. The administration is now focusing on negotiations with countries including Vietnam, South Korea and Japan. The stated aim is to use the leverage Trump has built up with his tariffs to extract concessions that would open the door for more US exports or new investments in the US. While Trump has dropped tariff rates for those countries to 10% for 90 days to tee up talks, he hasn\u2019t ruled out raising them again. How successful talks will be remains unclear, as is what exactly Trump wants or how firm he will be in holding to a 10% baseline that he and aides had set as a floor. Flying to Florida on Friday evening, Trump called the 10% \u201cpretty close\u201d to a floor, but he didn\u2019t rule out going lower. That has opened the door for countries to push for lower tariffs in their own negotiations, including with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic who will meet his counterparts in Washington today. Read more: EU Races to Expand \u20ac2 Trillion Trade Club as US Links Sour European officials hope his trip will provide a better sense of the US\u2019s willingness to negotiate and what its priorities are. But in spite of repeated calls for European unity, there\u2019s no consensus on how far the bloc should go with concessions, or how to retaliate if talks fail. Trump\u2019s weekend exclusion did not apply to the baseline 20% tariff he applied to China over fentanyl, and that levy remains in effect. China also has signaled so far that it is not interested in any negotiations. Trump\u2019s unpredictability still hangs over any talks as does his commitment to the idea of tariffs as an economic tool. Diplomats involved in discussions with Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer ahead of April 2 said even those cabinet members stressed privately that any agreement would still have to be approved by Trump and that they couldn\u2019t guarantee his response. Chip Strategy The expected so-called Section 232 national security investigations that would lead to sectoral tariffs could take months. Friday\u2019s exemption list provides the clearest sign yet of which products could be affected. One key area is AI hardware, which the US imports primarily from Taiwan as well as Mexico, where a host of Taiwanese companies handle final assembly of products destined for the US. AI servers shipped from Mexico have so far escaped the tariffs, as much of that hardware falls under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement tariff exemption, according to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon. If the eventual chip-sector tariffs do end up hitting servers, one guide for what\u2019s to come may lie in Trump\u2019s previous sectoral tariffs for autos and auto parts. Those products, subject to a 25% rate, are eligible for the USMCA exemption until the administration devises a process to impose tariffs on non US-content. But for AI servers and all other products on the exemption list that contain chips \u2014 including consumer tech like phones and computers \u2014 there\u2019s still a huge open question of whether the eventual duties would apply to the entire finished goods, or just the foreign-made chips they contain. Bloomberg Tracker: Every Trump Tariff and Its Economic Effect Trump\u2019s ultimate aim is to push more of the tech industry to rely on American supply chains. That would require a massive expansion of US chipmaking \u2014 something that\u2019s already underway, thanks in large part to the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump, however, wants to scrap the bipartisan law, and his latest tariff moves could make it more expensive for companies to complete the factories they\u2019ve announced. Based on Friday\u2019s exemption list, the chip-sector tariffs could also hit manufacturing tools, which form the lion\u2019s share of the price tag for new chip plants. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Upgrade Now Apple Escapes Catastrophe as Trump Tariff Reprieve Saves Core Products from 125% Levy Faizan Farooque Mon, Apr 14, 2025, 6:03 AM 1 min read In This Article: AAPL +2.21% Apple ( AAPL , Financials ) caught a much-needed break late Friday when President Donald Trump unexpectedly pulled back on a plan to slap a 125% tariff on electronics made in China, Bloomberg reported. The exemption, announced just before the weekend, gives Apple room to breathe. Key products like iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirTags are off the hook for now. All of them are built in China and would've been hit hard by the new import taxes. The move came just in time. The tech giant was staring down what some analysts feared could have been its biggest supply chain disruption since the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago. Even with this win, not all is clear. A 20% tariff still applies to other Chinese electronics, and Trump said he still plans to roll out a sectoral tariff on goods that contain semiconductors. No details yet on when or how that might happen. The administration described the exemption as just a procedural step in a bigger plan to reset trade with China. Trump added over the weekend that tariffs on popular consumer devices could still come later, keeping the pressure on companies like Apple. For now, though, it's a relief especially for an industry that still leans heavily on Chinese factories. The surprise move gives Apple and other tech firms a bit more time to rethink where and how their products are made, but the long-term uncertainty isn't going away.

If you have a car (particularly a relatively recent model year) and you have a smartphone (essentially everyone), then you probably know a little something about platforms like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Once you get used to either of those platforms, the modern driving experience feels like it is missing something without them. Android Auto is quite naturally our platform of choice, and if you happen to be someone who uses it on a nearly daily basis, then you're going to be really happy to hear that the app's version 14.1 update is now rolling out widely, after being restricted to a beta release for a bit. Let's talk about it. Android Auto 14.1 Isn't the Most Exciting of Updates, but Likely Brings Needed Bug Fixes Image: Motorola I don't use Android Auto. It isn't by choice, but simply because the cars that I get to drive here and there are much older models and simply don't come with that kind of functionality (in fact, Android wasn't even a thing at the time that they were manufactured). However, I do find myself wishing that I had that functionality due to the numerous occasions I want to play music or reference Maps when at the wheel. However, for those who do use Android Auto on a regular basis, I come with good news and my overwhelming envy. You'll be glad to know that now, after spending some time on the beta track since last month, Android Auto 14.1 is now available on a wider scale, for any users who might be interested. You can get it on the Google Play Store . Image: Google You might notice that the new update isn't available for you yet, but that shouldn't be too much of a surprise, as that's how things tend to go for Android Auto updates. While we wish it could just be one global update, Google seems to like expanding the radius of the release gradually over weeks. I'd generally expect that before the end of the week, it'll reach most people in the world. What New Stuff Comes With the Android Auto 14.1 Update? Image: Google I hate to burst your bubble, but this isn't one of those major updates that comes with several UI changes and new features. On the contrary, it doesn't seem to bring that much to the table, which likely means that there are probably just some performance tweaks and bug fixes happening behind the scenes, but I don't think you should turn your nose up at an update that will make the app run better. However, it might be setting the foundation for some pretty major Android Auto features that seem to be in the works. For one, Google Gemini is going to be making its way to Android Auto at some point, likely in the near future. On top of that, the app is also gearing up to bring temperature and defrost controls, giving you even more power over your vehicle. Oh, and Android Auto now already supports games on your car's screen. 0 0 Total 0 Shares Share 0 Tweet 0 Pin it 0 Share 0 Share 0 Share 0 Ayomide Sadiq Author Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.

Each device brings a unique combination of performance, design, and features, catering to diverse user needs. While the M4 MacBook Air stands out for its processing power, efficiency, and affordability, the Zenbook S14 counters with a superior display and versatile connectivity options. Below is a detailed comparison to help you determine which laptop aligns best with your requirements in a new video from Max Tech. Watch this video on YouTube . Design and Portability Both laptops excel in design, but their approaches cater to slightly different priorities. M4 MacBook Air: Apple\u2019s signature unibody aluminum construction delivers a sleek, minimalist aesthetic that exudes durability and sophistication. Its slightly thinner profile makes it an excellent choice for portability, especially for users who prioritize a compact and lightweight device. Zenbook S14: The Zenbook S14, with its premium aluminum finish, is even lighter than the MacBook Air, making it particularly appealing to frequent travelers. Additionally, it offers a broader range of ports, including USB-A and HDMI, which enhances its versatility for users who require diverse connectivity options. If portability and minimalist design are your top priorities, the MacBook Air edges ahead. However, the Zenbook S14\u2019s lighter weight and more comprehensive port selection make it a practical choice for users who value flexibility and convenience. Display The display is a critical differentiator between these two laptops, with the Zenbook S14 taking a clear lead in this category. Zenbook S14: Featuring a 120Hz OLED touchscreen, the Zenbook S14 delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and smooth visuals. This makes it an ideal choice for creative professionals, media enthusiasts, and anyone who values a visually immersive experience. M4 MacBook Air: The MacBook Air\u2019s 60Hz LCD display is functional and sufficient for general use. However, it lacks the color depth, contrast, and fluidity of the Zenbook\u2019s OLED panel, which may leave users who prioritize display quality wanting more. For tasks such as photo editing, video production, or immersive media consumption, the Zenbook S14\u2019s OLED display is the superior option, offering a richer and more dynamic viewing experience. Performance When it comes to raw performance, the M4 MacBook Air sets a new benchmark, showcasing Apple\u2019s advancements in chip design. M4 MacBook Air: Powered by Apple\u2019s M4 chip, the MacBook Air outpaces the Zenbook S14\u2019s Intel Lunar Lake processor in single-core, multi-core, and graphics benchmarks. Its fanless design ensures quiet operation while maintaining excellent thermal efficiency, even during demanding tasks such as video editing or software development. Zenbook S14: The Intel Lunar Lake processor performs well for everyday tasks, such as web browsing and document editing, and can handle light video editing. However, it falls short of the M4 chip\u2019s capabilities, particularly in high-performance scenarios that require significant processing power. For users who need a laptop capable of handling intensive workloads, multitasking, or creative applications, the M4 MacBook Air is the clear winner in terms of performance. Battery Life Battery life is another area where the M4 MacBook Air demonstrates its superiority, thanks to the efficiency of Apple\u2019s custom silicon. M4 MacBook Air: The M4 chip\u2019s energy efficiency enables the MacBook Air to deliver approximately three hours more battery life than the Zenbook S14. This makes it an excellent option for users who need a laptop that can last through a full workday or extended travel sessions without requiring frequent recharging. Zenbook S14: While the Zenbook S14 offers respectable battery life, it does not match the longevity of the MacBook Air. This could be a limiting factor for users who rely on their laptops for extended periods without access to a power source. For those who prioritize long-lasting battery performance, the MacBook Air is the better choice, making sure uninterrupted productivity and convenience. Pricing and Value Affordability and value are key considerations for many buyers, and here the M4 MacBook Air takes the lead with its competitive pricing. M4 MacBook Air: Starting at $1,000 with 16GB of RAM, the MacBook Air offers an excellent balance of performance and cost. However, upgrading storage can significantly increase the price, which may be a consideration for users with higher storage needs. Zenbook S14: Priced at $1,400 for a configuration with similar specifications, the Zenbook S14 includes a 1TB SSD. This makes it an attractive option for users who prioritize storage capacity and are willing to pay a premium for it. For budget-conscious buyers, the M4 MacBook Air delivers better overall value. However, if storage is a top priority, the Zenbook S14\u2019s 1TB SSD could justify its higher price tag. Additional Considerations Beyond the core specifications, each laptop offers unique advantages that cater to specific user needs and preferences. Zenbook S14: The advanced OLED touchscreen and diverse port options make the Zenbook S14 a versatile choice for users who need a visually superior and highly connected device. These features are particularly appealing for creative professionals and those who frequently connect external devices. M4 MacBook Air: The MacBook Air benefits from macOS reliability, seamless integration with other Apple products, and better resale value. These factors enhance its appeal, especially for users already invested in the Apple ecosystem or those seeking a long-term investment. Your decision may ultimately depend on how much you value these additional features and how they align with your specific use case. Final Thoughts The M4 MacBook Air emerges as the better choice for most users, offering superior performance, efficiency, and value. Its advancements in processing power, battery life, and affordability make it a standout option in the laptop market. However, the Zenbook S14 remains a compelling alternative for users who prioritize display quality, port variety, and storage capacity. Ultimately, your choice will depend on your individual needs and preferences. Whether you value raw performance or a visually stunning display, both laptops provide strong options tailored to different use cases.

The message, posted to Truth Social, came after some electronics were excluded from his administration's 145% import levies on goods from China. On Friday, a notice published by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office said that smartphones, computers and other electronics are excluded from his administration's tariffs on goods from China. Since early April, Mr. Trump has ratcheted up tariffs on China-made goods in a tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China over trade duties. However, those electronics are still subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl, according to Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff on policy, and as reiterated by Mr. Trump in his Truth Social post on Sunday. Nevertheless, Wall Street is interpreting the change in tariff rates for electronics as a win for the tech sector, especially Apple , which manufactures most of its iPhones in China . \"[O]n Friday night by the White House excluding Big Tech and the chip sector from the China 145% reciprocal tariffs, this took the doomsday scenario off the table and tech stocks will rally tomorrow as investors can now breathe a sigh of relief,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives in a Sunday research note. President Trump's tariff plan brings concerns about prices, CBS News poll finds 03:00 Stocks are poised to rise in Monday trading, with S&P 500 futures up 1.2%. That would come after the markets rallied on Friday , with the S&P gaining 1.8% and posting its best weekly performance since November 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq are also poised to rise Monday, with futures up 1% and 1.7%, respectively. The Chinese commerce ministry said Friday's move was only \"a small step\" and all tariffs should be canceled. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Monday \u2014 as he kicked off a Southeast Asia tour with a visit to Vietnam \u2014 that protectionism \"will lead nowhere\" and a trade war would \"produce no winner.\" Semiconductors and electronics supply chain Despite the relief expressed by investors on Monday, Wall Street experts are cautioning that the Trump administration's messaging on tariffs could signal more pain ahead. On Sunday, Mr. Trump wrote in his Truth Social post that his administration is examining the semiconductor industry and the electronics supply chain in its national security tariff investigations. Those issues were highlighted Sunday by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in an interview with ABC News, when he said that the exemption on some electronics was only temporary and that they would be subject to \"semiconductor tariffs\" that would likely be introduced in a month or two. U.S. stock futures rise despite confusion over Trump tariff exemption for electronics 09:25 \"Directionally, things seem to be getting more positive for buy-rated tech giants like Apple and Nvidia \u2014 but it isn't yet an 'all clear,'\" wrote Ben Reitzes of Melius Research in an April 14 research note. Before the administration exempted smartphone and electronics from the global tariffs, Apple's popular iPhone was on course to see massive price increases, with prices jumping hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. For instance, the iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which retails for $1,199, would have jumped to $1,874, an April 9 analyst from UBS Investment Research shows.

MSRP: $29.00 Check price What we like Apple and Google compatibility Out-of-range alerts Bluetooth 6.0 Extra functionality in Chipolo app What we don't like No UWB No USB-C charging Chipolo POP The Chipolo POP takes everything good about a lot of other Bluetooth trackers and mixes them together. It's compatible with both Apple's Find My and Google's Find My Device networks, has a keyring hole, Bluetooth 6.0 for more accurate distance measurement, and a removable CR2032 battery. Rita El Khoury / Android Authority It took years for Google to launch its answer to Apple\u2019s AirTag and its successful Find My network, but now that the Find My Device network is here, a lot of companies are jumping on board to make compatible Bluetooth trackers. Chipolo and Pebblebee were some of the first, but more companies have joined them since, including Motorola with its excellent Moto Tag. Chipolo is back again with its next-gen tracker, the POP ( $29 at Amazon ). This time, it aims to beat both Pebblebee and the Moto Tag at their own game. Like Pebblebee\u2019s latest universal trackers , the POP is compatible with both Apple and Google\u2019s networks, and like the Moto Tag , it offers a standalone app with extra functionality. It doesn\u2019t have an ultrawideband chip (UWB), but it does have Bluetooth 6.0, which opens up the door for more precise finding. I\u2019ve been testing it for over a week, so let me tell you what I think about it. What makes the Chipolo POP a little special Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Looking at the POP, I was hard-pressed to notice any difference with Chipolo\u2019s previous trackers. In the image above, POP is green, while black is the ONE Spot (Apple Find My), white is ONE Point (Google Find My Network), and red is the regular ONE (Chipolo\u2019s app on both iOS and Android). The POP comes in six colors, too \u2014 white, black, green, yellow, red, and blue \u2014 so it\u2019s hard not to confuse these. But the dot above the logo sticks out on the POP; it\u2019s carved into the older models. If you want a tracker that works with your Android phone today and your potential iPhone next year, this is the way to go. Minor esthetic differences aside, the POP\u2019s uniqueness is more internal and in its extra functionality. As I said, it\u2019s compatible with both Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s networks, just like Pebblebee\u2019s universal trackers. You have to reset the tracker to move from one network to another, so you can\u2019t use it on both of them simultaneously. But if you want a tracker that works with your Android phone today and your potential iPhone next year without locking you into one ecosystem, this and the Pebblebees are the most versatile choice for now. There\u2019s still a CR2032 battery inside, which should last about a year. Given my experience with previous Chipolo trackers with the same battery, that tracks out. I usually need to upgrade the battery around the 11-13 month mark \u2014 a year if we\u2019re averaging things out. The keyring hole is still there for extra convenience, too. The Bluetooth range has been upgraded to 90 meters instead of 60 on the previous ONE Point, and the tracker is now IP55-rated with certified dust resistance versus the IPX5 from earlier Chipolo trackers. Bluetooth 6.0 is a decent, and potentially more universal, compromise versus UWB. But perhaps the biggest hardware upgrade is the move to Bluetooth 6.0 , which brings support for Channel Sounding for more accurate distance measurement between phones and the tag \u2014 potentially. It\u2019s not UWB (there\u2019s no directional finding), but it should tell you exactly how far the tracker is and do it more accurately than the current range finder does with Bluetooth 5. It\u2019ll obviously require both a compatible Bluetooth 6.0 phone (more phones are now launching with it) as well as Google and Apple to add it into their Find My/Find My Device spec. Once those stars are aligned, the POP should be nearly as good as the Moto Tag with its potential UWB support. I\u2019d have preferred a UWB chip, personally, but Bluetooth 6.0 is a decent \u2014 and potentially more universal \u2014 compromise. What makes the Chipolo POP a lot more special Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Currently, both Apple and Google\u2019s Find apps have very limited functionality, which restricts a lot of trackers from offering features that independent tags like the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 and Tile trackers can offer. So, like Motorola did with the Moto Tag, Chipolo has circumvented that by augmenting the POP\u2019s features through its own app ( Play Store ). So I set up the Chipolo POP in Find My Device on my Pixel 9 Pro and then received a pop-up asking me to install the Chipolo app. The POP was immediately detected in the app, and with it came a bunch of extra features: software updates, ringtone options, phone calling, camera control, and most importantly, out-of-range alerts. After agreeing to several permissions, I started testing these. The entire POP tracker is a button that can be double-pressed to ring my phone. Finally, my tracker can help me find my phone instead of just the other way around! This is pretty similar to the Moto Tag\u2019s functionality, but Moto lets you also adjust the phone\u2019s ringing volume, while Chipolo lets you flash the phone\u2019s flashlight to see it in the dark. Good for people with hearing disabilities. Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Out-of-range alerts are the most interesting feature, though, and the one that differentiates between the new Chipolo POP and all other Find My Device-compatible trackers; even the Moto Tag doesn\u2019t offer this. I purposefully left my keys at home a few times, and like clockwork, each time I walked out, I got a notification from the Chipolo app reminding me about them within a minute. It\u2019s as reliable as Samsung\u2019s and Tile\u2019s notification, and faster than Apple\u2019s even. Out-of-range or left-behind alerts differentiate between the POP and many other Google Find My Device trackers. The only missing bit is that it doesn\u2019t seem to offer safe places. So if I attach the POP to my backpack, knowing I don\u2019t take the backpack with me every time I leave home, I\u2019d still get notified about it. Samsung, Tile, and Apple\u2019s Find My network offer safe places by comparison. Besides these, I was able to choose my tracker\u2019s ringtone among 12 options (more than the Moto Tag\u2019s four) and set it up as a camera shutter. But the latter only works in the camera built into the Chipolo app and only for selfies. Motorola requires more permission and accessibility access, but it can integrate its Moto Tag\u2019s remote shutter button with my Pixel\u2019s default camera app. I obviously prefer Moto\u2019s approach, but I use this so little (and I have a remote shutter functionality on my Pixel Watch 3 for when I really need it) that it\u2019s not a dealbreaker for me with the POP. Here\u2019s a small table resuming the hardware and software features of the Chipolo POP against its two biggest competitors: Chipolo POP Moto Tag Pebblebee Clip Universal Compatibility Chipolo POP Google Find My Device + Apple Find My Moto Tag Google Find My Device Pebblebee Clip Universal Google Find My Device + Apple Find My Connectivity Chipolo POP Bluetooth 6.0 with Channel Sounding Moto Tag Bluetooth 5.4 Pebblebee Clip Universal Bluetooth 5.4 Range Chipolo POP 90 meters (300 ft) Moto Tag 100 meters (330 ft) Pebblebee Clip Universal 150 meters (500 ft) Alerts Chipolo POP 120dB siren Moto Tag 75dB siren Pebblebee Clip Universal Siren + LED lights Battery Chipolo POP CR2032, up to 1 year Moto Tag CR2032, up to 1 year Pebblebee Clip Universal Rechargeable USB-C, up to 1 year IP rating Chipolo POP IP55 Moto Tag IP67 Pebblebee Clip Universal IPX6 Keyring holder Chipolo POP Yes Moto Tag No Pebblebee Clip Universal Yes Unknown tracker alers Chipolo POP Yes (Android and iOS) Moto Tag Yes (Android and iOS) Pebblebee Clip Universal Yes (Android and iOS) Locate/Call phone Chipolo POP Yes, sound and flashlight Moto Tag Yes, sound with customizable volume Pebblebee Clip Universal No Out of range alerts Chipolo POP Yes, Android (Chipolo app, no safe spaces) and Apple (Find My app, safe spaces) Moto Tag No Pebblebee Clip Universal No Remote camera shutter Chipolo POP Yes, selfie only inside Chipolo app Moto Tag Yes, your phone's camera with accessibility permissions Pebblebee Clip Universal No Customizable sound/ringtone Chipolo POP Yes, 12 options to choose from Moto Tag Yes, 4 options to choose from Pebblebee Clip Universal No Firmware updates in standalone app Chipolo POP Yes Moto Tag Yes Pebblebee Clip Universal No Dimensions Chipolo POP 38,8 mm diameter 6,6 mm thick Moto Tag 31.9mm diameter 8mm thick Pebblebee Clip Universal 45mm x 38mm 8.5mm thick Price Chipolo POP $29 Moto Tag $29.99 Pebblebee Clip Universal $34.99 Colors Chipolo POP White, Black, Green, Yellow, Blue, Red Moto Tag Starlight Blue, Jade green Pebblebee Clip Universal Black The elephant in the room: Google\u2019s Find My Device network Rita El Khoury / Android Authority If you\u2019ve read any of my Find My Device experiments in the past few months, you already know what\u2019s coming. If not, you can either spend a few hours with a cup of coffee reading about why I don\u2019t think Google\u2019s finding network is solid enough (I\u2019ve been comparing this network against Apple\u2019s, Samsung\u2019s, and Tile\u2019s for the better part of a year now) or just trust me when I say that Google\u2019s network is just unreliable . Google has a lot of work to do to solidify its network's reliability and convince me. It\u2019s gotten better since I last wrote about it \u2014 I won\u2019t deny that \u2014 but it still blanks out completely sometimes, even with many Android devices nearby. Sometimes, it won\u2019t even realize a tag is right next to my phone. I still maintain that Samsung has a more solid network for Android users , even if it\u2019s officially limited to Samsung phones. Google has a lot of work to do to solidify its network\u2019s reliability, especially in less dense areas or after several hours of disconnections. Until it does, all of these trackers come with an asterisk: Buy at your own risk, with the hope of something better down the line. Chipolo POP review: The verdict Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Of course, the network issue is no fault of Chipolo, and the POP is as solid a tracker as I have seen. I\u2019d put it right next to the Moto Tag in my tests, and honestly, if you\u2019re going to use it with Apple\u2019s Find My, you should have no reservations whatsoever. If you have an Android phone, though, I recommend you weigh your options. For Samsung phone owners, the Galaxy SmartTag2 ( $29.99 at Amazon ) is still a no-brainer; everyone else should either wait a bit to make sure Google\u2019s network is becoming more reliable or take a gamble on it now and hope for the best. If you do, you can opt for the rechargeable battery of the Pebblebee Universal trackers ( $34.99 at Manufacturer site ) which lacks any extra functionality, pick the Moto Tag ( $29.99 at Motorola ) for its potentially upcoming UWB support and dash of extra functions (while knowing you can never switch it to Apple\u2019s network), or go for the Chipolo POP ( $29 on Amazon or on Chipolo\u2019s website ). It\u2019s universal across Apple and Android and has tons of extra functionality, but it only offers distance finding through Bluetooth 6.0 and it has a removable coin cell battery. For me, the compromise is worth it, if only for the out-of-range left-behind reminder alerts. Chipolo POP Chipolo POP Apple and Google compatibility \u2022 Out-of-range alerts \u2022 Bluetooth 6.0 MSRP: $29.00 The Chipolo POP is the most versatile and functional Bluetooth tracker yet. The Chipolo POP takes everything good about a lot of other Bluetooth trackers and mixes them together. It's compatible with both Apple's Find My and Google's Find My Device networks, has a keyring hole, Bluetooth 6.0 for more accurate distance measurement, and a removable CR2032 battery. It's also compatible with Chipolo's own app for extra functionality like out-of-range alerts, phone ringing, remote camera shutter, and custom ringtones.

Photo: Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac Apple makes the best desktop PCs and laptops. But I cannot say the same for its accessories. While I have been using Macs for more than a decade, I rely on these five Mac accessories made by third parties to enhance my experience. The list ranges from a wireless keyboard to an ergonomic mouse to headphones that will amaze you with their noise cancellation. Read about my five favorite Mac accessories below. This post contains affiliate links . Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. These are my 5 favorite Mac accessories Apple offers accessories like the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse and the AirPods Max to complement the Mac experience. But after 14 years of using Macs , I\u2019ve discovered that many third-party accessories offer better functionality, comfort and value. That combination makes them well worth the investment. Table of contents: My 5 favorite Mac accessories Logitech MX Keys S Logitech MX Master 3S CalDigit Thunderbolt Dock Charging Station Bose QuietComfort headphones 1. Logitech MX Keys S There\u2019s no better keyboard for Macs than the Logitech MX Keys S. Photo: Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard for Mac only stands out for its build quality and Touch ID integration. While the latter adds some appeal, it does not make the keyboard a must-have Mac accessory in my book. For the last couple of years, the Logitech MX Keys S has been my keyboard of choice. I could not be happier. It\u2019s paired with my Mac mini and MacBook Pro , and I can seamlessly switch between them at the press of a button. I find the spherically dished keys on the MX Keys S much more comfortable to type on than the ones on Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard. The ergonomic design reduces the strain on my wrist, even after hours of use. The keyboard also comes with programmable keys, to which you can assign any shortcut or function you like. Backlit keys and customability FTW Unlike Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard for Mac, the MX Keys S features backlit keys, which can aid with typing when working in the dark. As a bonus, you can customize almost every aspect of the MX Keys S with the Logi Options+ app . This includes the backlight timeout, assigning custom shortcuts to the function keys and more. Even better, you can customize the keys\u2019 function based on whatever app you have open. And with Smart Actions , you can automate repetitive tasks at the press of a button. The keyboard\u2019s battery life holds up well, though it doesn\u2019t quite match Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard. The built-in battery lasts 8 or 10 days on a single charge for me. Logitech says you can extend the runtime to five months by turning off the backlight. But the keyboard charges over USB-C, making it easy to top up its battery when it\u2019s low on juice. If you find the Logitech MX Keys S too big for your desk, you can get the MX Keys Mini instead. It ditches the dedicated number pad for a smaller, more compact profile. Consider the MX Mechanical if you want a keyboard with tactile mechanical keys. It comes in three switch variants: Tactile Quiet, Clicky and Linear. Popular Logitech MX Keys S Combo $198.76 This high-performance wireless keyboard and mouse combo comes with palm rest, customizable illumination, fast scrolling, Bluetooth, USB-C and works with Mac, Windows, Linux, and Chrome. Pros: Buy MX Keys and Master MX 3S together Easy switching between Mac and Windows Fast scrolling Wrist rest included Cons: Keyboard is full size, not portable No color or style choices Buy from Amazon 04/07/2025 04:27 am GMT 2. Logitech MX Master 3S As much as I like Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad for its gestures, I can\u2019t use it as the primary mouse with my Mac mini. It exacerbates the pain in my weary wrists, which I want to avoid as much as possible. Instead, I use the Logitech MX Master 3S , the company\u2019s current flagship mouse. It stands out with its ergonomic design, customizable buttons and an 8K DPI sensor. Unlike Logitech\u2019s previous offerings, the MX Master 3S features Quiet Clicks, reducing the right/left click and the scroll wheel sound by 90%. The 8K sensor makes it easy to navigate across my dual-monitor setup at the flick of a wrist. Similarly, the magnetic scroll wheel makes scrolling through long documents a less frustrating experience. Excellent customization and long battery life Like the MX Keys S, the MX Master 3S stands out for its extensive customization options, which makes it one of the best Mac accessories for power users. I can customize the back, forward and thumb buttons (as well as the horizontal scroll wheel) individually for each app to suit my needs. Another highlight: battery life, with the mouse lasting more than two months on a single charge. I typically top up the cell before that, with a quick charge making things faster. If you are a power user and spend hours on your Mac, I strongly recommend you buy the Logitech MX Master 3S for the ergonomic comfort alone. If you are always on the move, consider the Logitech MX Anywhere 3S instead. Its compact design makes it easy to carry around, with the 8K DPI sensor working on any surface, including glass. Logitech MX Master 3S $99.99 Logitech's flagship MX Master mouse stands out for its precision, features and ergonomic design. The 8K Darkfield sensor ensures the mouse can track on any surface, with the Quiet Click technology helping provide near-silent clicks. Take advantage of the customization buttons and electromagnetic scroll wheel to further boost your productivity. Pros: 8K DPI sensor Exhaustive set of features Customizable buttons Cons: Prone to connection dropping issues on Macs Buy from 04/07/2025 12:10 pm GMT 3. CalDigit Thunderbolt Dock The CalDigit TS3 Plus has all the ports I need. Photo: Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac The M4 Pro Mac mini that I use sports five USB-C ports, including three Thunderbolt 5 ports on the rear. While there\u2019s enough bandwidth to connect multiple devices, there are not enough ports to connect them all simultaneously. That\u2019s why I use the CalDigit TS3 Plus dock. Despite being a Thunderbolt 3 dock, it does the job perfectly, allowing me to connect multiple monitors, hard disks and other accessories to my Mac all at once. At any given time, I have two monitors, three external SSDs and a few other USB accessories connected to the dock. It even includes an SD card slot on the front. This makes it a breeze to quickly get data off my DSLR or GoPro\u2019s memory card. Another reason I use a Thunderbolt dock is for the convenience it offers. I can connect my M1 Pro MacBook Pro to the same set of monitors and accessories on my desk with just one cable. I simply unplug the Thunderbolt cable from my Mac mini and plug it into the MacBook Pro. Additionally, the dock delivers 87W of power, ensuring the laptop stays charged and ready to go. CalDigit keeps improving its Mac accessories, and the company now makes better and newer options than the TS3 Plus. The CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt 4 dock packs 18 ports, including a 2.5Gb Ethernet port. Plus, it can output up to 98W of power to charge your MacBook Pro. If you want a more compact option with fewer ports, check out the CalDigit Element 5 Hub . CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt 4 Dock $379.99 The versatile dock features 18 ports and 98W charging. Ports: 3x Thunderbolt 4 40Gb/s, 5 x USB-A, 3 x USB-C (10Gb/s), 2.5GbE, single 8K or dual 6K 60Hz displays. Compatible with Mac, PC, Chrome via 0.8m cable. Pros: 18 ports 98W charging 8x USB ports Cons: No 10Gb Ethernet port Buy Now 04/07/2025 12:06 pm GMT 4. Charging Station The Baseus Nomis is a sleek-looking charging station with 140W total output. Photo: Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac If you use as many devices as I do, you can never have enough power plugs and charging bricks around. I also don\u2019t like cluttering my desk with unwanted chargers and cables. That\u2019s why I find a charging station to be one of the best Mac accessories for keeping things organized and productive. Previously, I used the Acefast 218W power station , with its transparent front adding a techy vibe to my desk. However, I recently switched to the Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 charging station for its Qi2 charging pad and retractable USB-C cable. It can charge up to five devices simultaneously, including my 16-inch MacBook Pro at full speed. That\u2019s more than enough for my needs. The total 140W combined power output leans toward the lower end, but still handles my needs since I rarely fast charge all connected devices simultaneously. Plus, the Nomos intelligently allocates power based on each device\u2019s battery level. Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station 140W $149.99 $119.98 The Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 charging station is a sleek charging station for your desk that can help reduce unwanted clutter with its retractable 100W USB-C cable and Qi2 charging pad. In total, it can top-up up to 5 devices at once. Pros: Sleek and compact design Retractable 100W USB-C cable Qi2 charging pad Cons: Wireless charging limited to 5W on non-iPhones Total power output cannot exceed 140W Buy from 04/06/2025 09:28 am GMT 5. Bose QuietComfort headphones The Bose QuietComfort stands out for its impressive sound quality and ANC. Photo: Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac I love the speakers on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Even after almost four years of owning the laptop, the six-speaker setup amazes me with its loudness and sound quality. But you can\u2019t always use the speaker, especially when traveling. In such cases, I turn to the Bose QuietComfort headphones. They stand out for their excellent noise cancellation, which helps silence distractions and lets me stay focused on my work. That makes them one of the best Mac accessories around, especially on long flights. The headphones are supremely comfortable to wear, allowing me to work for hours at a stretch on my MacBook Pro in complete silence. Their sound quality impresses just as much, making it hard to find any faults. Battery life poses no problems either, with the QuietComfort lasting close to 30 hours on a single charge, even with ANC enabled. Based on my usage, a single charge lasts about 10 days, and the headphones are always ready when needed. The Bose QuietComfort headphones also support multi-connect pairing, so they can remain connected to two devices simultaneously. This ensures I can seamlessly switch between my Mac and phone while wearing the headphones without having to switch devices manually. Bose QuietComfort Headphones $349.00 The Bose QuietComfort stands out for its amazing ANC and sound quality. The long battery life and comfortable design act as a cherry on top, making them a great pair of headphones to own. Pros: Excellent ANC Great sound quality Long battery life Cons: Missing support for LDAC and higher bitrate codecs Buy from Amazon 04/14/2025 11:28 am GMT Conclusion: Best Mac accessories I can\u2019t live without These five Mac accessories are the best I\u2019ve found in my decade-plus of using Apple computers. They truly elevate the way I use my Mac \u2014 whether boosting productivity, improving connectivity or simply making everyday tasks more enjoyable.

Close Home Tech Smartphones Mobile Accessories AirTag too quiet? This alternative is much louder and works with Android and iPhone Use them to find your keys and phone, and even take a selfie. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing Editor April 14, 2025 at 6:00 a.m. PT ZDNET's key takeaways Small, durable, water-resistant, and loud User-replaceable battery lasts a year Like all third-party tags, they do not support Apple precision finding. View now at Amazon For me, finder tags like the Apple AirTags have been a game changer. And that's not a word of hyperbole. They have literally saved me countless hours of hassle, headaches, and heart-wrenching frustration trying to find out where I put something down. OK, I know if I took my grandpa's advice and \"had a place for everything and put everything in its place,\" I wouldn't need them, but that doesn't happen (sorry, Grandpa!). Also: The best power banks you can buy Now that the finder tag market has opened up to third-party players, we're seeing some real innovation. One company that has stood out to me is the Slovenian tech company Chipolo . I've tested, reviewed, and used several tags from this company, and they don't disappoint. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Chipolo POP finder tags The Chipolo POP works with Apple's Find My network or Google's Find My Device networks. details View at Amazon Chipolo has just released a new line of tags -- the POP . These tags can be used with Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device networks, which means your devices can be found pretty much anywhere in the world. Finding your lost stuff has never been easier. Chipolo/ZDNET Each tag has a Bluetooth range of 300 feet/90 meters. The tags come in a range of colors -- blue, black, green, red, white, and yellow -- so you can color-coordinate with your wardrobe or personalize things like keys. The tags are thin and don't add much bulk to a bunch of keys. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET Each tag emits a super-loud 120-decibel sound, as loud as a thunderclap, rock concert, or big fireworks display. This makes the sound perfect for finding your keys when they've disappeared down the back of the couch. The tags are powered by a user-replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts about a year. Thanks to the free Chipolo app, the tags come with additional features. For example, to find your phone, just give your tag a quick double squeeze, and it will ring even if set to silent. You can also use the tag as a selfie button for your camera. The hole for a lanyard or keyring is a nice, handy touch. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET You can also say goodbye to boring beeps by changing the tag's ringtone, and you can get notifications when you leave something behind (this is an Android-only feature). Also: The best portable power stations you can buy And don't worry about getting these tags wet -- they are rated IP55 for water and dust resistance, so they can handle being splashed with water or soaked by rain. Wet grass is no match for the POP. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET The POP tags are made in the EU using approximately 50% recycled materials and come in paper packaging designed with sustainability and recycling in mind. Also: I found the smartest (and cheapest) way to protect your laptop's charging port As with all third-party tags, the device does not support the precision finding feature that Apple's AirTags, iPhone and, AirPods support. ZDNET's buying advice I really like the Chipolo POP finder tags . They are priced right at $29, have a handy design incorporating a hole for a keyring or lanyard, come in many colors, and have additional features unique to the POP.

Unsurprisingly for our consumerist society, people were disappointed that they couldn't actually purchase it. Enter a company called Atomic Keyboard, a company with no history I can find and whose website has no \"About\" section. The mysterious company claims they're developing an IRL version of the Dasher Keyboard , the companion to the Terminal Pro used by the unlucky Macrodata Refinement workers on the show. \"The keyboard has become a symbol of the show's distinctive aesthetic and themes. The absence of escape keys mirrors the employees' inability to escape their work situation, while the specialized function keys represent the compartmentalized and controlled nature of the severed floor.\" \"Mechanical keyboard enthusiasts appreciate the vintage-inspired design, unique keycap profiles, and the tactile, satisfying typing experience suggested by the show. The keyboard embodies both retro computing nostalgia and the show's unique dystopian aesthetic.\" The company is taking sign-ups for the $400 keyboard now, though no production date has been announced. In an age where people are apparently running out of things to spend their money on, I'm sure there will be no shortage of buyers. o Favorite This Q Comment Share your thoughts Join over 240,000 designers who stay up-to-date with the Core77 newsletter.

The pact marks the latest collaboration for Runway, which last fall set an agreement with Lionsgate and last week got into business with Harmony Korine\u2019s multimedia studio and tech boutique Edglord. Founded in 2018, Runway earlier this month announced $308 million new funding, at a valuation in the range of $3 billion. In a blog post, Runway said the partnership would encompass \u201ca broad range of use cases\u201d spanning phases from \u201cearly concept ideation and storyboarding to production-ready VFX workflows.\u201d Watch on Deadline Related Stories News James Cameron Wants To Use AI To \"Cut The Cost\" Of Filmmaking Without \"Laying Off Half The Staff\" News YouTube Backs 'No Fakes Act' And Expands Pilot Program Limiting AI-Generated \"Likenesses\" Fabula is known for films like the Oscar-winning A Fantastic Woman as well as high-profile biopics like Maria and Spencer . The Santiago, Chile-based company has also produced acclaimed series La Jaur\u00eda and Se\u00f1orita 89 as well as the upcoming Midnight Family for Apple TV+, a medical drama inspired by the documentary of the same name. Commercial production will be another arena for AI. Fabula has produced commercials for brands like Nissan, Santander and Samsung. One upcoming title that could benefit from the Runway AI tools, which are built on chips from Nvidia (which is also an investor in Runway) is The Shepherd . The sci-fi project is directed by Cutter Hodierne, whose film Fishing Without Nets captured two awards at Sundance, including the Grand Jury Prize for Drama. Hodierne is using Runway tools to help capture locations in the Andes and other remote areas. The filmmaker is crafting high-fidelity pre-visualizations of the film and bringing clarity to the story, shoot logistics and visual effects work. \u201cAt Fabula, we\u2019ve never shied away from new opportunities,\u201d said Juan De Dios Larra\u00edn, Fabula\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cThe tools that Runway has developed are world class and allow us to innovate and streamline the creative work that we do.\u201d Andrew Hevia, Head of Fabula\u2019s North American office, said the company is mindful of the mistrust about AI that created major rifts between major Hollywood unions and studios in 2023. But with technology improving and the industry evolving to make responsible use of budget all the more crucial, he said Fabula embraces opportunities for \u201cfilmmaker-led\u201d initiatives like the Runway partnership. Runway tools have already been used across Fabula\u2019s portfolio. \u201cGetting to experiment with these tools has been tremendously exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve helped us bring ambitious projects to market with incredibly compelling pitch materials in a way that wasn\u2019t possible before now.\u201d In an interview with Deadline, Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela said the partnership will help advance the company\u2019s goals of putting filmmakers at the center of AI\u2019s transformative effect. \u201cCutter\u2019s work has pushed boundaries and drawn acclaim for over a decade, and we\u2019re excited to see how he\u2019s applying Runway to The Shepherd ,\u201d Valenzuela said in the blog post. \u201cRunway\u2019s tools will help empower Fabula\u2019s directors to break new ground while reinforcing our commitment to funding and supporting artists and filmmakers around the world.\u201d \u201cWorking with Runway has been transformational for my creative process,\u201d said Hodierne. \u201cTypically, I \u2018discover\u2019 the visual language of the film on location and refine it in the edit. But now, it feels like I\u2019ve been able to make these discoveries and visually edit the look and feel of the movie while still in a writing phase.

This post was written by Langston Sessoms, producer for Opening Bid. Video Transcript 00:00 Speaker A So China, what, the second largest holder of treasuries, uh, and they're getting hit with these large tariffs from the Trump administration. Do you envision them dumping treasuries? If so, do they do so aggressively? And what are the ramifications of China doing that to the US economy? 00:31 Speaker B See that that's part of the the the scare out there is that China doesn't even have to dump, but if they if they leak that they might dump, uh, then other people try to get in front of that. Um, there's also a lot of banks that that are in this this whole basis trade. That's a big problem. That's unwinding a lot of hedge funds, really, that are in this trade. And that that's unwinding. So it's like a combination of China and people worrying about China and Japan. Um, you know what, we're in a trade war with them. Maybe they're not going to be there to buy our bonds. And so there's that worry, and then we have this very complicated basis trade that's blowing up. And so those three those things are happening at the exact same time. So at the end of the day, what I talked about on my video is the last 30 years when whenever there was a crash in the stock market, when Lehman went down, you made eight trillion, investors made, well, they lost eight trillion of stock value, but they made three and a half trillion back on bonds. And when COVID hit, investors lost $9 trillion, but they made $4 trillion back on their bonds. Imagine that. Now, we've lost nine trillion bucks the last since February 19th, $9 trillion. And you basically haven't made anything back on the bond side. 22:05 The bond market is headed for a crisis Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 02:46 How Grant Cardone is using bitcoin to buy real estate Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago 22:04 One finance pro\u2019s bold plan to fix your financial blind spots Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago 02:48 'Made-up' tariff math fuels recession fears & credibility doubts Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 5 days ago View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices CA Privacy Notice More Info US Europe Asia Rates Commodities Currencies Cryptocurrencies S&P Futures 5,434.00 -6.75 (-0.12%) Dow Futures 40,647.00 -94.00 (-0.23%) Nasdaq Futures 18,935.25 +0.50 (+0.00%) Russell 2000 Futures 1,881.90 -9.40 (-0.50%) Crude Oil 61.02 -0.51 (-0.83%) Gold 3,236.60 +10.30 (+0.32%) My portfolios Sign in to access your portfolio Sign in MP MP Materials Corp. 27.59 +4.91 (+21.65%) PIII P3 Health Partners Inc. 8.99 +1.41 (+18.60%) BMA Banco Macro S.A. 91.00 +12.15 (+15.41%) BBAR Banco BBVA Argentina S.A. 20.36 +2.57 (+14.45%) GGAL Grupo Financiero Galicia S.A. 61.43 +7.56 (+14.03%) MLGO MicroAlgo Inc. 11.96 -2.06 (-14.67%) U Unity Software Inc. 18.16 -1.07 (-5.56%) APP AppLovin Corporation 236.07 -13.88 (-5.55%) RXRX Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 5.51 -0.25 (-4.34%) TNXP Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. 16.15 -0.73 (-4.32%) NVDA NVIDIA Corporation 110.71 -0.22 (-0.20%) F Ford Motor Company 9.71 +0.38 (+4.07%) PLTR Palantir Technologies Inc. 92.62 +4.07 (+4.60%) INTC Intel Corporation 20.31 +0.57 (+2.89%) AAPL Apple Inc. 202.52 +4.37 (+2.21%) BA The Boeing Company 159.28 +2.44 (+1.56%) BAC Bank of America Corporation 36.67 +0.72 (+2.00%) JNJ Johnson & Johnson 154.36 +2.63 (+1.73%) NFLX Netflix, Inc. 931.28 +12.99 (+1.41%) TMC TMC the metals company Inc. 2.8300 +0.8800 (+45.13%) Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices CA Privacy Notice Ad Terms Feedback More Info", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-china-huge-risk-finances-130000000.html", "source": "Yahoo Entertainment", "published_at": "2025-04-14T13:00:00"}, {"id": 777, "title": "Goldman Sachs Reports Strong Equities Trading; More Tariff News Expected", "content": "Goldman Sachs Reports Strong Equities Trading; More Tariff News Expected Goldman Sachs Reports Strong Equities Trading; More Tariff News Expected By JJ Kinahan Follow Author Share Save Comment Money Markets Goldman Sachs Reports Strong Equities Trading; More Tariff News Expected By JJ Kinahan , Senior Contributor.

As I got older, riding a roller coaster meant I was diving deep into the ibuprofen bottle the next day. Markets last week resembled a roller coaster and by the time we were done riding, many of us needed some ibuprofen. At the end of the week, the S&P 500 had gained 5.5%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 7.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had tacked on 5% and the Russell 2000 notched higher by just under 2%. But those gains hardly tell the full story. Although equites gained on the week, bonds were hammered. Oil, which closed down just slightly for the week had a range of nearly $9. Gold added another 7% to an already huge run this year. Finally, the U.S. dollar lost nearly 3%. The tumult continues to be sparked by trade policy and just what exactly is being tariffed and by how much. After the close on Friday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released a list of products that would be exempt from tariffs. That list was largely comprised of technology products such as tablets, iPhones and semiconductors. It was welcome news that lasted for all of about 36 hours. On Sunday morning talk shows, administration officials said the products listed as exempt were not exempt and instead, would be subject to a different set of tariffs. Those tariffs are expected to be announced Monday, though markets seem enthusiastic the announcement won't be too harsh. As an example, shares of Apple are trading higher by 5% in premarket. The confusion and fluidity with which policies are being announced and changed is leading to a lot of confusion. You can see that confusion as expressed in market volatility where the VIX closed last week at 37.56, more than twice its historical mean. Confusion is also evident in consumer sentiment where last week's Michigan Consumer Expectations and Consumer Sentiment surveys reflected a more pessimistic view of economic conditions. I think it will be interesting, as we get deeper into earnings season, to triangulate how consumers see the economic prospects with what companies have to say. Speaking of earnings, Goldman Sachs is out this morning with their earnings. The company beat on both the top and bottom line. We have a few less common household names reporting this week until Thursday, when Netflix reports after the close. For the quarter, earnings are on pace to increase 7.3%, according to FactSet, with a whisper number of 10%. Because of the pullback we've seen in equities recently, the 12-month forward-looking P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is currently 19.

On Wednesday, Retail Sales are due out. Then, throughout the week, we\u2019ll have members of the Federal Reserve speaking, with Jerome Powell talking on Wednesday. I think anytime the Chair of the Fed speaks, markets tend to take note. But given the current situation, I think markets will be even more tuned into hear what Powell is thinking with respect to interest rates. For Monday, equity indices are higher in premarket. Although the new technology product tariffs are expected today, it looks as though markets are expecting the rates to be significantly lower than initially feared. I'm going to be watching bonds as those continue to be where the greatest tumult rests. Currently, the rate on the benchmark 10-year note is 4.43% while rates on the 30-year bond are 4.85%. I'm also watching volatility which in the premarket is down 11% from Friday's close. As I mentioned above, the VIX remains very high and so long as it remains at these levels, we can expect choppy trading. Lastly, this is a shortened trading week with markets closed on Friday for Good Friday. It's not uncommon to see market activity taper off around mid-week when there is a long weekend on the calendar. However, what makes this shortened week more interesting is that it's April options expiration. Therefore, we could see heightened option activity a little earlier in the week than we might normally. For investors that have options expiring this week, just keep in mind you have one less day.

I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this, but if you didn\u2019t already realize, you are under attack. No matter the operating system you use, the applications you rely upon or the faith you have in Big Tech to protect you, attackers are coming for your accounts and your data. The higher the profile of those accounts, the more valuable they are and the more hacking scrutiny they are under. Which is why we see security warnings involving such things as Apple ID attacks , X social media data leaks , and both Android and iPhone smartphone FBI defense advice . It is, however, Gmail and Microsoft that are most valued by hackers for the data that a successful account hack can expose. News of the evolution of an already perilous threat that can bypass 2FA protections that both Google and Microsoft have in place is, therefore, naturally of huge concern. Here\u2019s what you need to know and what both tech giants say you must do right now. Forbes Microsoft\u2019s New Windows Update \u2014 1 Billion Users Warned: Do Not Delete By Davey Winder The Evolution Of Tycoon 2FA Tycoon 2FA is not a new threat, far from it, in fact. As I reported March 26, 2024, the adversary-in-the-middle attack kit first came to the attention of threat intelligence experts in 2023. In March 2024, however, the criminal developers behind it turned the threat dial up a notch or two by releasing an update that specifically targeted Microsoft 365 and Gmail account holders and employed advanced obfuscation and anti-detection capabilities. Those attackers have, it seems, now turned the dial to 11. New intelligence from security researchers at Trustwave has revealed even more sophisticated evasion techniques being deployed against Gmail and Microsoft users in the latest 2025 attacks. According to the new report\u2019s authors, Trustwave\u2019s Phil Hay and Rodel Mendrez, these include \u201cusing a custom CAPTCHA rendered via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode characters in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to thwart inspection.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 - Patch 8 Is Big, Beautiful And Sad While conceding that none of these techniques are groundbreaking, individually at least, combining them does pose a new threat that makes detection and response even more difficult. Custom CAPTCHA visuals in HTML5, for example, can add legitimacy to phishing attempts, Unicode and Proxy-based obfuscation can delay detection, and anti-debugging behaviors hide malicious activity from automated tools. Forbes Automatic Password Hacking Machine Confirmed \u2014 Stop Using Passwords Now By Davey Winder Another Trick Up The 2FA Bypass Phishing Threat Obfuscation Sleeve Bernard Bautista and Kevin Adriano, also working at Trustwave, have reported how threat actors are using harmless-looking images to hide what are actually dangerous links in a phishing attack. Not just using, but employing them in what the researchers have described as a \u201cmajor spike\u201d in this type of attack obfuscation. The attacks are ones that exploit the fact that Scalable Vector Graphics image files are based on the Extensible Markup Language, unlike more typical image formats, and that means they can contain interactive scripts. \u201cSVG-based attacks have sharply pivoted toward phishing campaigns,\u201d the report warned, \u201cwith a staggering 1800% increase in early 2025 compared to data collected since April 2024.\u201d Notably, a large surge in such campaigns has been observed during the first quarter of 2025, driven \u201clargely by the emergence of Attack-in-the-Middle, Phishing-as-a-Service, platforms such as Tycoon2FA,\u201d the researchers said. SVG files are popularly, and perfectly legitimately, used in web design and branding campaigns due to their sharp image output, but the researchers warned that their ability to embed JavaScript introduces serious cybersecurity risks. Attackers use this to inject malicious scripts directly into the image files, which can then \u201cexecute automatically upon opening the file, enabling a wide range of cyberattacks, including unauthorized system access, data theft, identity compromise, and leakage of sensitive information.\u201d The problem is, if it really needed any further explanation, that these malicious scripts can be executed without the need for explicit user interaction, and they are more difficult for security tools to detect and block. Plus, of course, the small matter of people having an elevated yet false sense of security when it comes to images, including SVG files, which are often treated as being of no risk at all. Forbes Windows Users Given 24-Hour Warning As Attackers Strike By Davey Winder Do This To Protect Against 2FA Bypass Attacks Right Now Trustwave recommended that security teams should \u201cconsider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns\u201d in order to stay one step ahead of the Tycoon 2FA attackers. Google and Microsoft, however, have some more straightforward advice for ordinary users when it comes to protecting themselves and their valuable accounts from the 2FA bypass hackers. The simple truth is that, from the end user defensive posture perspective, the mitigation advice when it comes to Tycoon 2FA attacks is the same now as it was in 2024, namely, use passkeys. A Google spokesperson said that \u201cpasskeys substantially reduce the impact of phishing and other social engineering attacks. Google research has shown that security keys provide a stronger protection against automated bots, bulk phishing attacks, and targeted attacks than SMS, app-based one-time passwords, and other forms of traditional two-factor authentication.\u201d Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson said, \u201cAs a security best practice, we encourage customers to always practice good computing habits online, including exercising caution when clicking on links to web pages, opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers. In addition, we recommend switching to Passkeys wherever possible and using authentication apps such as Microsoft Authenticator, which warn users about potential phishing attempts.\u201d So, there you have it: use passkeys to protect your Gmail and Microsoft accounts, not only against this 2FA bypass attack but also against other potential threats.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. News and opinion about video games, television, movies and the internet. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 08:37am EDT Share Save Comment The Last of Us HBO The White Lotus is over, replaced by another of HBO\u2019s Emmy-nominated prestige series, The Last of Us. It\u2019s the rare video game adaptation that has received loads of critical and audience acclaim, though that has been a growing trend between Amazon\u2019s Fallout and a lot of Netflix animated productions. Fans of the game have either enjoyed the series so far, nitpicked a number of differences between them, or both. You can do both. But one thing that has come up already is how the show has handled Abby in two different ways. One appearance-wise, the other story-wise. Mini-Abby \u2013 Game Abby is well, huge. She\u2019s a weightlifter, a powerhouse with large muscles that were a signature of her appearance in the game. Kaitlyn Dever is really the opposite, just 5\u20192 (which is still an inch taller than Bella Ramsey) but nowhere near being a powerlifter and the show did not demand she gain 40 pounds of muscle for the role. Abby Naughty Dog This has been addressed since Dever was cast a while back. First of all, Neil Druckmann said that finding an actress Abby\u2019s size, plus a similar age, would have been extremely difficult and severely narrowed the pool of actors to choose from. But mainly, Abby\u2019s size was about a gameplay different in the TLOU Part 2, not something that was the single key to her character: Play Puzzles & Games on Forbes FEATURED | Frase By Forbes \u2122 Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Play Now Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Play Now Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Play Now Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder Play Now \u201cIn the game, you have to play both characters [Ellie and Abby] and we need them to play differently,\u201d Druckmann said. \"We needed Ellie to feel smaller and kind of maneuver around, and Abby was meant to play more like Joel in that she's almost like a brute in the way she can physically manhandle certain things. That doesn't play as big of a role in this version of the story because there's not as much violent action moment to moment. It's more about the drama. I'm not saying there's no action here. It's just, again, different priorities and how you approach it.\u201d Dever is of course an amazing actress (go watch Unbelievable, Dopesick and most recent, Apple Cider Vinegar on Netflix) so that took priority over Abby\u2019s size. I think she does look like her to some extent (sort of a cross between game Ellie and Abby, honestly), and she\u2019s going to do a great job, I imagine. Abby\u2019s Motivations \u2013 Last night, players saw that the show was saying right away that Abby was a Firefly and was angry at Joel for all his murders at the hospital, decimating the entire organization. We don\u2019t know precisely why Abby is so furious compared to the others, but this is a lot more information than you get in the game. Abby just shows up and you don\u2019t really know who she is or why she does what she does in relation to Ellie, Joel and the rest of the community. That backstory unfolds as we play as her over the course of the game. The Last of Us HBO Neil Druckmann explained why this was in a Washington Post interview . Once again, it\u2019s a game/show issue in terms of structure. If they followed the game exactly, we wouldn\u2019t know Abby\u2019s motivations at all for this entire season, given that its only half the second game, and fans would be waiting the better part of two years to know what\u2019s going on with her. Additionally, games are a narrative \u201cshortcut\u201d because you can play 20 hours in a week or so to get to Abby\u2019s story, but if they kept it the same, again, it would be months or even years. That likely would not work, so we at least know some of her motivations from the start. I get it, I think these are good decisions, even if they depart from the games.

By Gizmodo Deals Published April 14, 2025 | \ud835\udd4f Copied! \u00a9 Amazon AirTags have been a godsend for those who have a habit of misplacing their belongings: Whether it\u2019s your keys, wallet, bag or luggage (or even your pet\u2019s collar), these small Bluetooth trackers offer a simple and effective solution to keep track of your belongings. Amazon is now offering great discounts on the single AirTag unit and the 4-pack set which it an excellent time to pick up this handy device. Though these prices aren\u2019t all-time lows, they\u2019re near enough to low to make this offer very attractive\u2014especially with word on the street that tariffs might double the price of electronics any time soon. The individual AirTag is now just $24 (orig. $29) , and the 4-pack bundle can be had for $79 (orig. $99) . Both options are Top 5 bestsellers in Amazon\u2019s Electronics category right now. See 4-pack AirTags at Amazon See single AirTag at Amazon Very Useful Tracker The AirTag is a tiny attachment that makes finding lost items simple: It\u2019s very simple to set up\u2014just tap it to your iPhone or iPad , assign the AirTag a name for what you\u2019re using it for (such as \u201cKeys\u201d or \u201cBackpack\u201d) and you\u2019re ready to go. When linked to your Apple ID, the AirTag cooperates with the Find My app to display its location on a map in real time. If the item is nearby but not in sight, you can use Precision Finding on recent iPhones that have Ultra Wideband technology for a very precise location with on-screen directions and sound. Or you can have the AirTag play a sound from its built-in speaker to locate it in seconds. One of the unique features of the AirTag is that it is able to leverage Apple\u2019s vast Find My network which is composed of hundreds of millions of devices across the globe. When you misplace something outside the home (at a hotel or airport, for example), the AirTag can transmit its location anonymously through nearby Apple devices and back to you via iCloud. This feature makes your items trackable even when they\u2019re out of Bluetooth range . Obviously, privacy and security are also important aspects of the AirTag design: The device uses encrypted communication to protect your data and prevent unwanted tracking. Moreover, if someone attempts to use an AirTag to track you against your will, your iPhone will detect and alert you if there are any unfamiliar trackers nearby. As fears mount over imminent tariff hikes that would essentially see electronics prices go through the roof, it\u2019s a great time to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s discounts. Purchasing AirTags today will ensure that you are not caught off guard by rising costs in the near future.

Tech stocks, led by Apple and Nvidia, are poised for significant gains after President Donald Trump announced exemptions for smartphones, computers, and key devices from tariffs. However, some uncertainty lingers as Trump clarified these exemptions may not be permanent. Meanwhile, major US banks reported mixed Q1 results, contributing to a volatile market environment. With gold hitting new highs, the market remains uncertain, but optimism is high for a strong start to the week. ETMarkets.com US stock market prediction today sees Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise with tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia leading gains. Market optimistic after tariff exemptions and mixed Q1 bank results US stock futures kicked off the week on a strong note as President Donald Trump surprised markets by temporarily exempting key tech items like smartphones, computers, and semiconductors from reciprocal tariffs. The Dow Jones futures surged over 400 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 80 and 320 points respectively, signaling a bullish start to the trading day on April 14, 2025. The White House\u2019s move comes after weeks of intense market volatility fueled by trade tensions. Investors welcomed the break, especially as the exemptions cover high-impact devices critical to the tech industry. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the exemptions aren\u2019t permanent, injecting a dose of caution into the market euphoria. Stock Futures Movement Dow Futures : Up 388 points (+1%). S&P 500 Futures : Up 1.5%. Nasdaq-100 Futures : Up 1.7%. Tech Stocks Boost Apple : Gained 5% in premarket trading. Nvidia : Rose 3% in premarket. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) : Increased by 2%. Tariff Exemption Details Exempted Products : Smartphones Computers Semiconductors Other tech devices and components Trump\u2019s Clarification : Products are still subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl tariffs, just moved to a different tariff \"bucket.\" Recent Market Volatility S&P 500 : Dropped 5.4% since the announcement of reciprocal tariffs. Nasdaq Composite : Fell 5%. Dow Jones Industrial Average : Down 4.8%. Premarket Stocks Making Moves Goldman Sachs : Gained nearly 2% after beating earnings estimates. Reported earnings of $14.12 per share vs. $12.35 expected. Revenue of $15.06 billion vs. $14.81 billion expected. Pfizer : Shares down slightly after halting development of weight loss pill due to liver injury reported in a trial. Apple : Up 5% following tariff exemption news on smartphones and tech products. Market Trends CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) : Spiked above 50 last week. Reciprocal Tariff Impact : Significant market uncertainty, despite temporary reprieve. Oil Prices : Influenced by uncertainty regarding tariffs and recession concerns. Why are stock futures rising today? Stock futures are showing a strong upward movement this Monday, with Dow futures climbing by 388 points, or 1%. S&P 500 futures have increased by 1.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 1.7%. This boost comes after a surprise move by President Donald Trump to temporarily exempt certain tech products from new tariffs. Why did Trump ease off tariffs on tech devices? According to Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social, the exempted items still fall under the broader 20% fentanyl tariffs but are \u201cjust being moved to another bracket.\u201d The administration appears to be walking a fine line\u2014soothing Wall Street without fully backing down on its aggressive trade stance. Analysts believe this decision may be aimed at stabilizing domestic markets while negotiating from a position of strength with trade partners, especially amid reports of Chinese export surges. However, with the exemptions described as \u201ctemporary,\u201d uncertainty still hangs over global trade. Live Events How did the tariff exemption impact tech stocks? Tech stocks saw a significant lift following Trump's tariff exemption announcement. Apple shares surged by over 5% in the premarket, while Nvidia gained more than 3%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) also rose by over 2%. The exemption includes products like smartphones, computers, and semiconductors, which are major components in tech supply chains. These exemptions brought relief to tech companies that had been under pressure due to the president's previous tariff announcements. How are major stocks performing premarket? Before the opening bell, several stocks were making headlines due to significant news developments: Goldman Sachs: The investment bank gained nearly 2% after reporting strong first-quarter earnings, beating analysts' expectations. Goldman Sachs posted earnings of $14.12 per share, significantly above the anticipated $12.35, with revenue of $15.06 billion surpassing the expected $14.81 billion. Pfizer: Pfizer shares were down slightly after the company announced it would halt development of its daily weight loss pill due to a liver injury reported during a trial. This news caused some market hesitation for the pharmaceutical giant. Apple: Apple saw a substantial premarket gain of over 5%, following Trump\u2019s tariff exemption announcement for smartphones and other tech products, which helped ease concerns about the impact of tariffs on the company\u2019s bottom line. How are global markets reacting to this unexpected policy twist? Asian markets immediately responded with gains. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.18%, and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI rose by 2%. Meanwhile, European stocks also opened higher, with the FTSE 100 up 2%, Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 2.5%, and France\u2019s CAC 40 climbing over 2%. The rally wasn\u2019t limited to equities\u2014Logitech led a charge in software stocks, soaring nearly 9% in London, and Convatec followed closely. Even European manufacturing and pharma stocks posted solid gains as the news of tariff delays spread. What\u2019s happening with oil, gold, and bond yields today? Gold, which had hit record highs last week due to escalating trade tensions, saw mild profit booking as investors rotated back into risk assets. Meanwhile, crude prices edged slightly higher but faced downward pressure after Goldman Sachs slashed its oil forecasts. The bank now expects Brent to fall to $63 per barrel by year-end due to rising supplies and recession fears. In the bond market, the US 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.43% after climbing to 4.55% on Friday. The drop reflects a cooling of market panic as investors digest the White House\u2019s partial trade rollback. Which stocks are making the biggest moves today? Tech and pharma stocks are leading gains across global markets. In the US pre-market, shares of Novo Nordisk jumped 4.5% after Pfizer scrapped development of its weight loss pill following a patient\u2019s liver injury. Pfizer\u2019s retreat boosted optimism around Novo Nordisk\u2019s GLP-1 drug pipeline. Logitech surged as tariff relief boosted confidence in the consumer tech sector. Meanwhile, European firms like GN Group, Technip Energies, and Vallourec all posted strong intraday gains between 4\u20136%. How are companies reacting to the shifting tariff landscape? Businesses across the globe are scrambling to adapt. Audi has suspended US imports, while Portugal\u2019s biggest wine exporter, Sogrape, is pulling from emergency stockpiles. Novartis AG just committed $23 billion to expand US operations over the next five years\u2014a sign that firms are hedging bets by investing directly in America. Some automakers like Stellantis NV are even rolling out customer discounts to stimulate demand amid tariff uncertainty. And in Europe, companies are racing to secure supply chains and shift production to avoid further disruptions. FAQs: What is the US stock market prediction for today?

That includes you, Jon Hamm\u2019s family and friends. Sitting down with DECIDER to chat about his new show, Your Friends & Neighbors , the Mad Men alum shared that he is hopeful that the show will shock and surprise everyone who tunes in to check out the \u201crich people behaving badly\u201d project. In the new drama series \u2014 which also stars Amanda Peet , Olivia Munn , and Aimee Carrero \u2014 Hamm plays Andrew Cooper, a divorced and disgraced hedge fund manager in the luxurious (fictional) suburb of Westmont Village, New York. After losing his job, Andrew resorts to stealing priceless goods from his neighbors\u2019 homes, which lands him in the middle of a twisted and dark web of secrets and lies. As for what he hopes his own friends and neighbors have to say about the show, Hamm told Decider he can\u2019t wait to hear what everyone in his life thinks about the dark but silly dramedy. He said the reception is part of what makes the job as fulfilling as it is. \u201cI hope they say that it made them subscribe to Apple TV+, honestly,\u201d the actor said with a laugh. \u201cI love when family and friends in my life see the work that I\u2019ve done and respond to it. I mean, that\u2019s kind of the real telling thing of what we do.\u201d Photo: Apple TV+ Hamm added, \u201cIf nobody sees it, then does it really exist? And when a lot of people see it, it means that a lot people like it, and that\u2019s meaningful. \u201c And Apple TV+ is counting on people watching it. Months before the series even debuted on the streaming platform, Apple TV+ gave the Jonathan Tropper-produced show a vote of confidence by renewing Your Friends & Neighbors for Season 2 . Don\u2019t get it confused, though, the Season 2 renewal doesn\u2019t imply that all the drama and chaos sown in Season 1 turns out okay for Andrew and the rest of Westmont Village. Hamm teased a dramatic season ahead after the release of the first two episodes and even more excitement to come when Season 2 releases, hopefully in early 2026. \u201cThe fact that we have a second season might lead you to believe that everything works out for Coop okay,\u201d he shared. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to be picked up so early in the existence of the show, it says a lot. It\u2019s the first time Apple has really done that. It definitely is a feather in our cap and also a nod to the fact that we completed our assignment in a very compelling way.\u201d Photo: Apple TV+ The assignment here is to create a dramatic show that will keep the audience on their toes until the very final moment. And that it does. It\u2019s only going to get wilder in Season 2, Hamm shared, keeping details on where the plot goes in its sophomore season vague. \u201cI\u2019m excited for other people to see it and see the story that we\u2019ve created ,\u201d he shared. The first two episodes of Your Friends & Neighbors are now streaming on Apple TV+. New episodes release Fridays and the entire first season will be available to stream on May 30.

Both sides are in desperate need of points, albeit for contrasting reasons. Inter\u2019s 3-1 home triumph against Udinese on Saturday intensified the pressure on Napoli ahead of this fixture. Antonio Conte\u2019s side cannot afford further slip-ups after last Monday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Bologna saw them squander another opportunity to close the gap on the reigning champions. With six points separating Napoli from the Nerazzurri ahead of the kick-off and only six rounds left, it\u2019s needless to discuss the importance of beating Empoli. Despite their tag as odds-on pre-match favorites, the Partenopei would be well-advised not to take their opponents for granted, especially after recent meetings in Naples. Roberto D\u2019Aversa\u2019s men have won twice on their last three Serie A visits to this stadium (L1) and will aim for another upset as they bid to end the club\u2019s joint-longest wait for a top-flight win. Last weekend\u2019s scoreless home draw against Cagliari condemned Empoli to their 16th consecutive league outing without a win (D5, L11). As a result, they entered this round two points adrift of safety. However, Lecce\u2019s defeat at Juventus means Gli Azzurri can claw their way out of the bottom three if they continue to be a thorn in Napoli\u2019s side. Given their recent showings, that could be easier said than done. Match Preview Napoli Napoli\u2019s chances of clinching a second Scudetto in three years have significantly dwindled across the past nine rounds. Indeed, no team across Europe\u2019s traditional top-five leagues has drawn as many league matches in that sequence as Conte\u2019s team (W2, D6, L1), highlighting an ominous dip in form. Although unbeaten across their last five Serie A games on home turf (W3, D2), Napoli couldn\u2019t keep a clean sheet in that period, suggesting another dramatic contest could be in store. Scoring first would only partially ease the home faithful\u2019s concerns, knowing the Partenopei wasted the lead in four of their last six league stalemates. Against this backdrop, Napoli are yet to concede against teams starting this round in the bottom four. Even if Empoli buck that trend and open the scoring somehow, the hosts should still be confident of getting three points over the line, having averaged a league-high 1.4 points per game when conceding first this season (W4, D2, L4). Empoli Keen to secure a fifth consecutive season in Italy\u2019s top flight, Empoli must stem the bleeding amid the worst patch in the club\u2019s Serie A history. Achieving that feat would require the visitors to defy a notorious trend of failing to beat any opposition starting this round inside the top six this season (D3, L7). As if that\u2019s not troubling enough, Empoli conceded an alarming 15 goals across five defeats against Serie A\u2019s current top three, underscoring the size of the task awaiting them in Naples tonight. Another disappointing result is a distinct possibility for D\u2019Aversa, whose managerial record against Napoli can hardly inspire confidence (W2, L7). However, Empoli gave the Partenopei a run for their money in December\u2019s reverse fixture. Indeed, a controversial penalty converted by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia midway through the second half separated the teams at the final whistle. Defensive solidity could again be the key to Empoli\u2019s hopes of upsetting the apple cart, as they\u2019ve conceded an average of 0.66 goals per game across their last three Serie A road trips. Team News Napoli cannot count on star defender Alessandro Buongiorno and attacking-minded full-back Leonardo Spinazzola due to injuries. Moreover, Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Giovanni Di Lorenzo are unavailable for selection after accumulating yellow cards against Bologna. Finally, this fixture may come too soon for goalkeeper Alex Meret. On the other hand, Empoli take this trip severely crippled by injuries, with Ardian Ismajli, Christian Kouame, Marco Silvestri, Nicolas Haas, Pietro Pellegri, Saba Sazonov, Szymon Zurkowski, and Youssef Maleh stuck in the treatment room. Napoli vs Empoli Potential Starting Line-ups Napoli (4-3-3): Scuffet; Mazzocchi, Rrahmani, Buongiorno, Olivera; Gilmour, Lobotka, McTominay; Politano, Lukaku, Neres. Empoli (3-4-2-1): Vasquez; Goglichidze, Marianucci, Viti; Gyasi, Grassi, Henderson, Pezella; Esposito, Cacace; Colombo. Napoli vs Empoli Prediction Despite Empoli\u2019s recent heroics on this ground, Napoli should stroll to an all-important win and maintain the pressure on Inter.

As President Donald Trump reshapes American foreign policy around hard-nosed deals and national self-interest, a new report warns the UK must rethink its strategy to preserve its \"special relationship\" \u2013 or risk being sidelined in Washington. Darren Spinck, a fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, cautions that there will be no \"business as usual\" under Trump and that the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and UK can no longer be taken for granted. To remain a key ally, Spinck argues in a new report, Britain must embrace Trump's \"transactional\" approach to foreign policy. \"Choosing not to retaliate\" against Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs may signal a \"strategic patience that may facilitate bilateral negotiations,\" the report states. It outlines steps that Prime Minister Keir Starmer could take to align with the Trump administration and pursue a U.S.-UK free trade deal, including deeper security cooperation and a tougher stance on China. Trump recently imposed 10% across-the-board tariffs on foreign nations and paused harsher levies he earlier proposed on every nation except China. CHINESE OFFICIALS CLAIMED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS PRC PLAYED ROLE IN US CYBERATTACKS: REPORT British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, left, leads the Labour Party. (Carl Court/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo) Another path, the report suggests, could involve the UK seeking accession to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the North American trade bloc, as a way to deepen economic ties with the United States. The report also urges the UK Labour Party leadership to \"reduce commercial dependency on the PRC rather than deepening it,\" warning that closer economic ties with Beijing could strain U.S.-UK relations under Trump. Spinck contrasted the Trump administration\u2019s focus on \"bilateralism, economic nationalism, and Indo-Pacific security\" with the Starmer government\u2019s preference for \"multilateral diplomacy, progressive trade policies, and European security commitments.\" \"This policy gap threatens transatlantic cohesion, weakening their collective ability to act against common adversaries, particularly China,\" he warned. Divergent policies on China , NATO commitments and Indo-Pacific strategy could erode Five Eyes intelligence sharing, which is key to UK national security. Spinck called on the British government to strike a deal with the U.S. that addresses the White House\u2019s digital privacy concerns \u2013 particularly after the UK ordered Apple to grant security agencies access to encrypted cloud data \u2013 and to launch a mineral mining partnership to bolster critical supply chains. Whereas the previous conservative UK government deemed China its \"greatest state-based threat,\" the current liberal leadership has \"reversed the course of the previous three Conservative Party Governments and has sought to strengthen economic ties with Beijing,\" according to Spink. He said the UK had recently advanced Beijing\u2019s access to Western capital markets and re-established bilateral frameworks on industrial, trade and energy policy with China. \"\u200b\u200bOne must wonder why London appears eager to expand economic ties with China \u2013 a country widely criticized for its human rights record \u2013 while the UK\u2019s development finance institution has been less inclined to support international infrastructure development or mining projects in other regions.\" UK PRIME MINISTER TO ADMIT \u2018GLOBALIZATION IS OVER\u2019 IN RESPONSE TO TRUMP TARIFFS: REPORT The UK's growing relationship with China is a cause for concern for the U.S., according to the report. ( Stefan Rousseau/Pool via REUTERS) \"As the Trump Administration seeks to further accelerate America\u2019s decoupling from targeted CCP economic and technology sectors, the US feels that the Labour Government\u2019s apparent rapprochement with Beijing, after years of cautious relations following the PRC\u2019s 2020 breach of the Sino\u2013British Joint Declaration, could unnecessarily complicate the \"Special Relationship,\" Spink wrote. He said that critical issues \"requiring transatlantic cooperation,\" such as a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, are \"at risk\" if the U.S. and the UK are not aligned on China policy. The UK must also set aside its disagreements over U.S. domestic policy, according to Spinck, due to the more urgent need for security cooperation. \"As the Labour Government works with President Trump\u2019s Administration, it should realize its views on a wide range of policies, including immigration, climate policy, digital privacy and welfare benefits, are vastly different,\" he wrote. READ THE REPORT BELOW. APP USERS: CLICK HERE He said such \"fractures\" like the UK government\u2019s demand for backdoor access to Apple\u2019s encrypted cloud storage \"have begun to define the overall relationship between the two allies, impacting the potential for foreign policy alignment.\" \"Overcoming these cultural differences requires a shift to a more transactional model of foreign policy cooperation. Britain needs to take an active role in re-setting this agenda, pushing questions of domestic ideology to the margins in favor of solid, mutually beneficial measures.\" The UK could also signal goodwill by taking a tougher diplomatic stance on Iran. Spinck urged London to help close the \"transatlantic divide\" on Iran policy, which he said has \"disrupted attempts to forge a coherent approach to stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear progress.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed sweeping sanctions, the UK remained a party and declined to trigger snapback sanctions \u2013 even amid reports that Iran had violated the agreement and was enriching uranium to near-weapons-grade levels. Spink also urged the UK to join the U.S. in designating Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Such moves, he argued, \"would also be seen as a victory for the long-established Trump policy on Iran \u2013 one that would cost the UK nothing and would generate much goodwill in Washington, D.C.\" Fox News Politics Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

On Friday night, the U.S. president handed Apple a major victory, exempting many popular consumer electronics. That includes iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and AirTags. Article content Article content Another win: The 10 per cent tariff on goods imported from other countries has been dropped for those products.

Article content A new and lower so-called sectoral tariff may still come on goods that have semiconductors, and a 20 per cent tariff still applies to electronics shipped from China. Over the weekend, Trump pledged he will still apply tariffs to phones, computers and popular consumer electronics, portraying the exemptions as a procedural step in a broader effort to remake U.S. trade. Article content Still, the timing for such a move remains uncertain. Till then, the surprise exemption marks a win for Apple and a consumer electronics industry that still heavily relies on the Asian nation for manufacturing. Article content \u201cThis is a major relief for Apple,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a note on Saturday. \u201cThe tariffs would have driven material cost inflation.\u201d Article content He expects the shares to rally Monday following an 11 per cent rout this month. Article content Before the latest exemption, the iPhone maker had a plan: adjust its supply chain to make more U.S.-bound iPhones in India, which would have been subject to far lower levies. That, Apple executives believed, would be a near-term solution to avoid the eye-watering China tariff and stave off hefty price hikes. Article content Article content Given that the iPhone facilities in India are on pace to produce more than 30 million iPhones per year, manufacturing from that country alone could have fulfilled a fair chunk of American demand. Apple, these days, sells about 220 million to 230 million iPhones annually, with about a third of those going to the U.S. Article content Stories You May Like Apple\u2019s Siri chief calls AI delays ugly Apple confirms delay of AI-infused Siri Advertisement embed-more-topic Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Such a shift would be difficult to pull off without a hitch, especially because the company is already nearing production of the iPhone 17, which will be made primarily in China. Within Apple\u2019s operations, finance and marketing departments, fears had grown about the impact on the fall launch of new phones \u2014 and fuelled a sense of dread. Article content Article content The company, in just a few months, would have needed to pull off the herculean task of moving more iPhone 17 production to India or elsewhere. It likely would have had to increase prices \u2014 something that\u2019s still possible \u2014 and fought with suppliers for better margins. And Apple\u2019s famous marketing engine would have had to convince consumers it was all worth it. Article content But the feeling of uncertainty remains. White House policies are likely to shift again, and Apple may need to pursue more dramatic changes. At least for now, though, management is breathing a sigh of relief.

Article content The Chinese Ministry of Commerce called the move \u201ca small step by the U.S. toward correcting its wrongful action of unilateral \u2018reciprocal tariffs\u2019, and urged the U.S. to \u201ctake a big stride in completely abolishing the wrongful action, and return to the correct path of resolving differences through equal dialog based on mutual respect.\u201d Article content However, smartphones other electronic devices that won exemptions will be part of a forthcoming levy on semiconductors, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Article content Speaking Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, Lutnick signaled that the late Friday reprieve \u2014 exempting a range of electronics from 125 per cent tariffs on China and a 10 per cent flat rate around the globe \u2014 was temporary, and reiterated Trump\u2019s longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. Article content Another concern: If Apple moves even more production from China at a rapid pace, how would the country retaliate? Apple generates about 17 per cent of its revenue from the country and operates dozens of stores, making it an outlier among U.S.-based companies. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Article content Article content China has launched competition inquiries into U.S. companies and could create issues for Apple through its own customs process. In recent years, it has also banned iPhones, among other U.S.-designed devices, from its legion of government workers. That followed a U.S. crackdown on Chinese tech champion Huawei Technologies Co. Article content The iPhone is Apple\u2019s biggest moneymaker, and about 87 per cent of them are produced in China, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley. About four in five iPads also are made in the country, along with 60 per cent of Macs. Article content All together, those products are responsible for about 75 per cent of Apple\u2019s annual revenue. Still, the company now builds nearly all of its Apple Watches and AirPods in Vietnam. Some iPads and Macs are also manufactured in that country, and Mac production is expanding in Malaysia and Thailand. Article content The company generates about 38 per cent of its iPad sales in the U.S., as well as about half its Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods revenue, Morgan Stanley estimates. Article content A complete split with China \u2014 Apple\u2019s manufacturing hub for decades \u2014 would be unlikely. Though Trump has pushed Apple to make iPhones in the U.S., the lack of domestic engineering and manufacturing talent will make that nearly impossible in the short run. Article content Article content The size and scale of the facilities in China makes it unmatched in speed and efficiency. The China production also is crucial for Apple\u2019s sales in the world beyond the U.S. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company gets nearly 60 per cent of its revenue outside of the Americas. Article content Since a wave of tariffs were announced on April 2, lobbyists from Apple and other technology companies have been pushing the White House for exemptions. Article content But the discussions took on extra urgency in recent days after a series of tit-for-tat retaliations between Washington and Beijing led to what amounted to 145 per cent duties on imports from China. Article content The potential impact was even more stark after Trump paused higher tariffs on other countries. That meant Apple rival Samsung Electronics Co. , which makes its phones outside China, would have had an edge. Article content Apple and other companies have been stressing to the Trump administration that \u2014 while they are willing to increase investment in the U.S. \u2014 there\u2019s little benefit in moving final assembly to the country. Instead, they have argued, the U.S. should be focusing on bringing back higher-value jobs and encouraging investment in things like semiconductor production.

In a lengthy post to Truth Social (via HuffPost ), the president insisted that \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook'\u201d and that \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday.\u201d This is confusing because U.S. Customs and Border Protection absolutely did publish a list of exempted products on that day. Trump\u2019s rationale for denying exemptions exist is that \u201cThese products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it.\u201d However, the claim made by media outlets this weekend was no more and no less than the simple and factual statement that a wide range of electronics, including nearly all of Apple\u2019s products, were being made exempt from the latest round of reciprocal tariffs. Macworld noted at the time that the so-called \u201cfentanyl\u201d tariffs appeared to remain in effect, but this does not change the fact that official sources had indicated that other far larger 125 percent tariffs on China imports no longer applied. We also noted that any exemptions could well be temporary and that the entire saga has been unpredictable. If the White House intends to apply a different \u201cbucket\u201d of tariffs to imported electronics in the future, that too does not contradict or refute the overall media coverage of the exemptions. And the government made no such indication in its announcement of the Reciprocal Tariff Exclusion . Macworld takes no pleasure in contradicting the president in this way and would be happy to never cover tariffs again. Sadly, because Apple manufactures so many iPhones in China, the tariffs stand to impact the company\u2019s customers through price rises . We will continue to note future changes in policy and their likely effect on Apple\u2019s operations.

ColorWare is known for its custom-decorated Apple accessories, like AirPods, and the ColorWare Apple Crayon Pro now joins that list. The ColorWare Apple Crayon Pro is available in seven colors, including black, mint, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow and is priced at $215, which is admittedly quite a bit more costly than the boxes of crayons we all used in school. (Yes, even the huge 64 crayon box with the built-in sharpener.) Each Apple Crayon Pro is created using a standard Apple Pencil Pro, so all of the usual Apple Pencil features and functionality are all there for you. Each Apple Crayon Pro boasts a custom colored tip and a matching wrapper, all of which is painted on a standard Apple Pencil Pro. In the past, ColorWare offered a customized Apple Pencil designed to look like a number 2 pencil (go Farber Mongols!), but these new crayon-like styluses will stir up memories of fun times at school, not standardized testing. These customized Apple Pencil Pros look quite a bit like the crayons we all love and remember fondly. ColorWare uses a multi-step coating system, using a primer, a proprietary color formula, and a liquid plastic coating designed to make the color last. All products are warrantied for 12 months. The \u200cApple Pencil\u200c Pro works with the M4 iPad Pro models, the M2 and M3 iPad Air models, and the A17 Pro iPad mini. ColorWare is selling the Apple Crayon Pro for $215, and all colors are available from the ColorWare website as of today. Orders will ship in approximately two weeks.

Nasdaq falls 4%, S&P drops 3.5% Tariffs, Toyotas, and truth tests: Stocks and data to watch today A surprise tariff announcement late Friday triggered the tech-led bounce on Monday. The electronics exemption, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, seemed to shield smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics from Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods \u2014 offering relief for companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, such as Apple, Nvidia ( NVDA +0.54% ), and Microsoft ( MSFT +0.24% ) Advertisement But the reprieve may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the products are still included under a round of semiconductor-related tariffs \u201ccoming in probably a month or two.\u201d Advertisement And President Donald Trump later rejected the idea that there had been any exemption at all, saying that the goods are still subject to existing 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs and that they had merely shifted tariff categories. He said no product was actually exempt, calling the change a simple reclassification. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook,\u2019\u201d Trump said Sunday on his social media site Truth Social. Advertisement Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized the shifting policies as \u201cchaos and corruption,\u201d warning that such unpredictability is eroding investor confidence. Forecasts cut amidst extreme fear Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index is still planted in \u201cextreme fear\u201d territory, reflecting a lack of bullish sentiment amid chaotic policy announcements \u2014 to say nothing of chaotic policy determination. The S&P 500\u2019s recent 5% intraday swings suggest volatility that is more structural than seasonal. Advertisement Analysts at both Morgan Stanley ( MS +1.48% ) and Citigroup ( C +3.39% ) have cut their year-end forecasts for U.S. stocks, pointing to rising risks from such unpredictable policy moves and continuing geopolitical tensions. Heading into a packed week of corporate earnings in which major banks, healthcare companies, and consumer-facing platforms such as Netflix ( NFLX +2.09% ) will report results, each release could either steady or rattle investor nerves.

President Trump said Monday afternoon that he was \u201cflexible\u201d when it came to a temporary exemption for Apple.

Even alongside valid fears of disruptions to Apple\u2019s supply chain, the company\u2019s product suite and global brand power remain unmatched. Goldman Sachs opens the earnings floodgates Goldman Sachs ( GS +2.42% ) reported a robust 15% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, driven by strong trading performance amid market volatility.

By Joe Tilleli Published April 14, 2025 | \ud835\udd4f Copied! \u00a9 Samsung We\u2019re a good third of the way into 2025 and with it comes a bunch of opportunities to save on a variety of electronics and personal devices. Last year, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds3 Pro and right now you can get them for as low as $125 . These noise-cancelling earbuds are normally priced at $250, but after a trade in, you can get a credit of up to $120. That\u2019s a 50% discount just for handing over your old earbuds you weren\u2019t going to use anymore anyway. If you don\u2019t have an old pair to trade-in, you can still enjoy a $40 discount for a limited time. Choose between either white or silver as both options are available with the trade-in deal and standard discount. See at Samsung A Comfortable Fit The Galaxy Buds3 Pro are designed to be Samsung\u2019s most comfortable in-ear headphones yet so they can stay in all-day comfortably for an immersive listening experience. The Buds3 Pro each come with it\u2019s charging case and charging USB-C cable as well as three sets of ear tips of various sizes so you can mold them to your ears perfectly. Adaptive active noise cancellation means the earbuds can change modes on their own automatically based on your surroundings. This allows you to stay alert to what\u2019s around you while still not being distracted by ambient sounds as you\u2019re listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks on the go. The adaptive equalizer can even tell how you are wearing them and tailor-fit the sound you hear to your ears. You can even pair them with your TV to experience full 360-degree immersive sound that feels like its coming from all around you. With Galaxy AI, you can have conversations across the language barrier, face-to-face, in real time. This is the kind of ability joked about by Douglas Adams with the babel fish in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series of novels. But now it\u2019s really coming I guess. They say \u201cHola,\u201d and you\u2019ll hear \u201cHello,\u201d in your ear. Touch controls make it easy to pause, skip, accept calls and more without needing to remove your phone from your pocket. Samsung Credit With Trade-in The trade-in will bring the price of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro to as low as $125. By trading in your old pair of earbuds, you can save up to $125 on your new Galaxy Buds3. Samsung is accepting a wide array of in-ear headphones are part of the offer. If you hand over a set of Galaxy Buds2 Pro, you\u2019ll receive the full $125 credit. A standard pair of Galaxy Buds or will net you $100 as will the original Galaxy Buds Pro. Samsung is also accepting Apple AirPods. Trade in the AirPods 3 or the AirPods Pro or Pro 2 and you\u2019ll get you the full $125 credit. Even if you just gave some off-brand set of wireless or wired headphones, you can still save between $10 and $30. And if you don\u2019t have a pair to trade in, you can still save $40 getting the Buds 3 Pro for just $210.

Open top menu Advertise Writers Contact Home Celebrities Royals Shop Podcast Links Archives Jack Lowden cast as Darcy in Netflix\u2019s new Pride & Prejudice: thoughts?? April 14, 2025 By Kaiser Emma Corrin , Jack Lowden , Olivia Colman You know how Hollywood feels like every generation needs their Spider-Man? It feels like someone \u2013 who??? \u2013 has decided that every generation needs their own Mr. Darcy as well. If I\u2019m being honest, I love both of the most well-known versions of Pride and Prejudice, the BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and the Joe Wright film starring Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden. Both are imperfect, but both are completely enjoyable and mostly faithful to Jane Austen\u2019s most beloved novel. I always think that younger people should just watch the 2005 film if they want an easy-to-digest version, because Keira really does such an amazing job as Lizzie, and she had such chemistry with Macfayden\u2019s Darcy. But still, they\u2019re remaking it into a Netflix miniseries and the cast list so far sounds\u2026 eh, interesting?? Jane Austen\u2019s timeless novel Pride and Prejudice has inspired many works of art since its release \u2014 and now it\u2019s headed to Netflix! On April 10, the streamer announced that best-selling author Dolly Alderton and director Euros Lyn were adapting Pride and Prejudice into a six-part series, starring Emma Corrin, Jack Lowden and Olivia Colman. \u201cOnce in a generation, a group of people get to retell this wonderful story and I feel very lucky that I get to be a part of it,\u201d Alderton told Tudum. \u201cJane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice is the blueprint for romantic comedy \u2014 it has been a joy to delve back into its pages to find both familiar and fresh ways of bringing this beloved book to life.\u201d The new series will join the lineup of dozens of other movies and series that have been adapted from Austen\u2019s novel. While no release date has been announced yet, there are plenty of versions available to view throughout the wait. The Pride and Prejudice series will be a period-faithful adaptation and closely follow the original text, per Tudum. [From People] I\u2019m trying to balance my anger at the idea that every generation should \u201cretell\u201d this story versus my hope that the miniseries format will help with a faithful-to-the-text adaptation. Like, if we\u2019re doing straight adaptations with all of Austen\u2019s nuances, the miniseries format is the best way to go. And P&P hasn\u2019t been a miniseries since 1995! THIRTY YEARS AGO!! As for the cast so far\u2026 Olivia Colman was cast as Mrs. Bennett , not Lady Catherine de Bourgh, although Colman could totally play Lady Catherine!! But she\u2019ll be a fantastic Mrs. Bennett, and I hope they don\u2019t update the character to make her less pushy or gauche. Emma Corrin as Lizzie is honestly inspired casting \u2013 if you want to know if Emma can play period drama, check out Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover on Netflix, which is SUCH a good adaptation and Emma is fantastic in it. Jack Lowden is better known to me as Saoirse Ronan\u2019s husband. He\u2019s good looking, for sure. But can he brood in corners and stare longingly at Lizzie?? Also: who should they cast as Jane and Bingley? Charlotte? Wickham? Photos courtesy of Avalon Red.

Reply kirk says: April 14, 2025 at 10:39 pm If Netflix isn\u2019t willing to fork out $$$$$$ needed to even begin to compete with the gorgeously intertwined sound track by Dario Marianelli, what\u2019s the point? Belle chere says: April 15, 2025 at 8:16 am This is the correct answer. Reply DianeS says: April 14, 2025 at 10:50 am Perfect. Reply Luc\u00eda says: April 14, 2025 at 10:50 am While I\u2019m not quite sure why we need yet ANOTHER P&P adaptation, I admit I\u2019m intrigued by Mr Saoirse. I\u2019ve seen him in a couple things as a supporting actor and he\u2019s quite good. Reply Blogger says: April 14, 2025 at 11:05 am They can adapt as much as they like, but will people watch it? Reply Barb Mill says: April 14, 2025 at 1:17 pm I will Aurora says: April 14, 2025 at 11:24 am He does a very good job as a 50% action hero / 50% underdog character in Slow Horses. Reply maisie says: April 15, 2025 at 1:16 am Lowden is indeed very good in Slow Horses, and also in Benediction, in which his character does a fair share of brooding (only over unrequited gay love). He\u2019ll make a wonderful Darcy. Not mad at the Corrin casting, and of course Colman will absolutely kill as Mrs. Bennet. I hope were not all black ash before it airs. Smu says: April 15, 2025 at 3:35 am We always need another P & P adaptation. I love them all. They should do a new one every year. Reply KC says: April 15, 2025 at 8:27 am He\u2019s really great in Slow Horses, which if you haven\u2019t watched \u2013 do it right away. I\u2019m 100% here for Olivia Colman as Mrs. Bennett. I only know Emma Corrin from The Crown and the Night Manager, so I don\u2019t have strong feelings about her as Lizzie. Also, the 1995 P&P is the definitive version and I\u2019ll go retire and die on that hill. \ud83d\ude0a Reply FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 10:56 am The BBC version from 1995 is the best, best, best. It\u2019s true to the story, and every actor fully and completely embodies the character. The movie is good, but Brenda Blethyn (as Mrs. Bennett) is the only actor who outshines the BBC performances. And even then, it\u2019s just a slight difference. Reply Becks1 says: April 14, 2025 at 10:59 am Yup! I enjoy the 2005 movie, but the 1995 version is perfection. Someone on here once \u2013 maybe Nic919 \u2013 said that the 2005 movie was a Bronte movie adaptation of an Austen novel and that just stuck with me as being so accurate. Reply Nic919 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:29 am Yes I have said that more than once. The 2005 movie adds Bront\u00eb elements to it that are missing the point of Austen\u2019s novel. Darcy is not going to be wandering the foggy meadows in the morning with his shirt undone. The whole point of Darcy is that he is emotionally repressed and abides by the decorum of the time. Blogger says: April 14, 2025 at 11:01 am Yup 1995 will be hard to beat. Reply Sue says: April 14, 2025 at 11:22 am I couldn\u2019t agree more with your comment. I know Mrs. Bennett is supposed to be viewed as ridiculous in P&P but the actress in the 1995 series was over the top in my opinion. I loved Brenda Blethyn\u2019s understated take on Mrs. B. and for the first time I could emphasize with her character when she tells Lizzie \u201cYou try having 5 daughters in this society and tell me what you would do.\u201d Reply Nic919 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:30 am This is where I can see Olivia Colman doing well with Mrs Bennett. Anne Maria says: April 14, 2025 at 12:12 pm Mrs B was the great Alison Steadman. Different takes. Sue says: April 14, 2025 at 11:28 am I also wanted to add that I think Tom Hollander\u2019s Mr. Collins in the 2005 film is perfect. Reply FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 12:47 pm Agree. He was icky to a perfect degree. Wif says: April 15, 2025 at 7:21 am I agree! The way they portrayed Collins in 95 was too greasy. You want him to be annoying enough that he\u2019s not a choice for Lizzy, but you also want him to be okay enough that you aren\u2019t devastated that Charlotte accepted him. Luc\u00eda says: April 14, 2025 at 11:31 am You know which one I unironically enjoyed? The 2012 Youtube Modern Day adaptation. It\u2019s a vlog-like mini-series which is obviously made on a tiny (if non-existant) budget and the actors are all unknown, but it\u2019s perfectly adapted, executed and entertaining. It\u2019s called The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. The only thing about it is that it\u2019s American, but I didn\u2019t really mind. Reply Nic919 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:10 pm I saw this one and it worked as a modern adaptation. Square2 says: April 14, 2025 at 1:07 pm Agree. The 1995 miniseries was the best. The 2nd best for me was the BBC 80\u2019s miniseries. Colman will be a fantastic Mrs. Bennet (Check out her in \u201cWonka\u201d). Reply Nanny to the Rescue says: April 14, 2025 at 10:57 am Lowden is quite good in Slow Horses. He has presence. Not sure if he\u2019d be a good Darcy, but I think he could ace it. Coleman as Mrs. Bennet is a great choice, but I feel she\u2019ll be campy. I don\u2019t like Corrin as Lizzie. I generally don\u2019t find Emma interesting in anything, I was relieved when The Crown updated Diana to Elisabeth Debicki. Reply Blogger says: April 14, 2025 at 11:02 am I suppose Emma is too old to play Georgiana? She could play that vulnerability\u2026not for Lizzie though. Reply FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 11:09 am Oooohhhh \u2014 THAT\u2019s who Lowden is. The guy from Slow Horses. Okay. He could be good. Almost everyone plays Mrs. Bennet as high camp. Hard not to, given the character. The 2005 film had the best Mrs. Bennet, I think. Reply MsDarcy says: April 14, 2025 at 11:57 am NannytotheRescue, I couldn\u2019t agree more. I am here for Lowden as Darcy after watching him for years on Slow Horses. He can slow burn with the best of them (cough, Colin firth, cough). But Emma Cornin\u2019s casting has left me almost as concerned as Dakota Johnson as Anne Elliot\u2019s casting, and i was right to be concerned about that one. I haven\u2019t see Lady Chatterley yet as suggested, so here\u2019s to hoping she can prove me wrong. Signed, an obsessed Austenite since 1986 when I first picked up Pride and Prejudice. Reply Lise says: April 14, 2025 at 2:00 pm I don\u2019t like the casting of Emma Corrin either. I didn\u2019t like them as Princess Diana and I almost feel that they have a too modern look? IDK, their features are just too modern. Plus, Lizzy is effervescent, witty, but with a core of strength and a magnetic personality \u2013 after all, she attracted more men in a course of a year than any other character in the book \u2013 or any Austen book \u2013 Darcy, Wickham, Mr. Collins, Col. Fitzwilliam. I just can\u2019t see Emma Corrin being able to personify Lizzy Bennet at all. I\u2019m not thrilled about Jack Lowden either. I don\u2019t think he is tall enough, for one thing \u2013 but I can\u2019t see him projecting that languid aristocratic hauteur that Darcy does so well. Olivia Colman will be fantastic as always. Lady Esther says: April 14, 2025 at 10:58 am I\u2019ve only seen him in Slow Horses and he was\u2026fine. Didn\u2019t put the world on fire but maybe he just needs the right role and maybe this is it? For me he\u2019s too short and burly to be a good old-school aristo Darcy like Firth and Macfayden who both had a bit of elegance and languor about them, like bored well-bred cats. Not height shaming but it matters in our nineteenth century romantic heroes! /s And Olivia was terribly miscast as QEII in The Crown imo but she can certainly play daft and funny, so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be\u2026.fine? The question is if the remake will actually bring anything new, but I\u2019m an old whose last Spiderman was Toby Maguire, so what do I know? Reply Blogger says: April 14, 2025 at 11:04 am Oh dear. He might turn out to be a dud like that Darcy in P&P meet the zombies or some such. So uninspiring as the lead gentleman. The Lost in Austen Darcy was very fine indeed\u2026 \ud83d\ude0b Reply MsDarcy says: April 14, 2025 at 11:58 am Blogger, Lost In Austen\u2019s Darcy was incredible. Such a wonderful show and Darcy. FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 11:12 am Laurence Olivier was a pretty good Mr. Darcy back in a 1940s movie. That whole entire film is AWFUL \u2014 costuming completely wrong, bad acting, etc. \u2014 but he is always good. He plays Darcy as less \u2026 mean than every other actor does, and it\u2019s interesting. Reply L4Frimaire says: April 14, 2025 at 10:59 am Why do they continually make the same adaptations over and over again? Reply Sue says: April 14, 2025 at 1:11 pm I reckon it\u2019s the same reason we will always see adaptation after adaption of Shakespeare\u2019s plays. They are stories and characters that have fascinated people for centuries. Reply Blogger says: April 14, 2025 at 11:01 am Not sure if I like any of the cast. Bowden looks more suited to play the Colonel or even Wickham, and Jane for Emma Corrin. Going to take me some convincing that these two would surpass Firth and Ehle. Then again, I\u2019ll give this a miss. Reply Becks1 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:04 am I don\u2019t love Olivia Colman as Mrs Bennett but I\u2019m willing to be surprised. It just makes me think they\u2019re trying to make the character into something more serious without the lighter nuance. Mrs Bennett\u2019s character is humorous and provides comic relief while also showing the very real worries that a mother in her position would have. She\u2019s ridiculous but not necessarily wrong in many ways and I think that can be a fine line to walk. I think Olivia colman is an excellent actress so I am hoping she can pull it off but I think of her as more of a dramatic actress. But we\u2019ll see. I have no idea who that actor is so I\u2019m open minded there. I think Emma corrin can do a decent job of Lizzie. I just hope this isn\u2019t like the monstrosity that was Persuasion although Mia McKenna Bruce was a bright spot in that one. So someone there knows what they\u2019re doing with Austen to a certain extent. Reply Nic919 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:34 am That recent persuasion show was awful. Dakota Johnson didn\u2019t grasp Anne Elliot at all. And Cosmo Jarvis wasn\u2019t that great as Wentworth either. He redeemed himself in Shogun though. Reply Becks1 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:39 am I only liked him as Wentworth because he was a better Wentworth than Dakota was as Anne elliot, but that is a very low bar, haha. Lady Esther says: April 15, 2025 at 6:17 am I straight-out LOVED Cosmo Jarvis in Shogun. A reviewer said \u201che sounds like a posho hanging out at the Old Globe Theater and smoking a pack a day\u201d and I can\u2019t unhear it, it\u2019s so true. Come to think of it, I think he would make a better Darcy than Mr Saoirse! Snoozer says: April 14, 2025 at 1:55 pm Olivia Coleman is hilarious and insanely talented at comedy. She\u2019ll be perfect. Reply Becks1 says: April 15, 2025 at 7:38 am I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her in anything comedic! that is reassuring to hear though. KC says: April 15, 2025 at 8:35 am Olivia Colman started out in comedy (Peep Show) until her agent was like, girl, you gotta go do some serious stuff or you\u2019re going to be stuck in the comedy ghetto for the rest of your career. I think she\u2019ll be great as Mrs. B. I bet her agent would love it that you think of her as a dramatic actress though. Peep Show is not to everyone\u2019s taste, but you might give it a try. I really love it. Reply Peaceful Warrior says: April 14, 2025 at 11:07 am Totally \ud83d\udcaf agree OC as Lady Catherine!! She would chew the scenery. But she could also do that as Mrs. Bennett. LOVE her. JL better as Wickham, I think, although I\u2019d prefer Leo Woodall. I\u2019d love to see Andrew Garfield as Mr. Darcy, Hugh Laurie as Mr. Bennett, Timothy Chalamet as Mr. Bingley, Florence Pugh as Jane, Anya Taylor Joy as Caroline Bingley\u2026 And that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got right now. Probably be back for more later. What a fun exercise!! Reply Lise says: April 14, 2025 at 2:03 pm He\u2019s probably too old now, but I\u2019ve always thought that Aiden Turner (Poldark) would make an excellent Darcy. He can smolder with the best of them. Reply Blogger says: April 14, 2025 at 8:28 pm @PW another for Hugh Laurie as Mr B! Reply Plums says: April 14, 2025 at 11:10 am I\u2019m always down for a new attempt at a faithful book adaptation for any Jane Austen novel, and it\u2019s nice that it looks like Netflix learned their lesson after that Dakota Johnson Persuasion trainwreck to not experiment with Jane Austen because that\u2019s not what literally anyone is here for when it comes to adapting those novels- that said, I know it\u2019s not in the cards after said trainwreck, because it\u2019s too soon or whatever, but I really wish we\u2019d get a new, faithful adaptation of Persuasion before they revisited P&P again. I\u2019m still so bitter the faithful Sarah Snook version was canceled because of the flaming garbage it turned out Netflix was producing at the same time. Reply FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 11:15 am The best Persuasion was the BBC one with Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. :: chef\u2019s kiss :: Reply JW says: April 14, 2025 at 11:30 am There have been highly successful and beloved experiments with Austen\u2014Clueless is still one of the best Jane Austen movies ever made. The problem with Netflix\u2019s Persuasion wasn\u2019t that they tried to do something different. It\u2019s that every single part of what they tried to do was awful. Becks1 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:33 am After I watched the Netflix one I immediately had to watch the Ciaran hinds one again, lol, as a palate cleanser. I think without Dakota Johnson and without the whole talking to the camera element Persuasion could have been a lot better. a lot of the supporting cast was decent. But it ended for me when she said \u201cnow we\u2019re something worse than exes. We\u2019re friends.\u201d Dont do Austen dirty like that. Nic919 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:37 am Omg Sarah Snook would have been a great Anne Elliot. The problem with the Netflix version is that they tried to make it modern but kept the costumes. It just doesn\u2019t work. Austen novels rely of the strict mores of the time which is why her heroines are placed in these circumstances in the first place. They should have done a total modern version like Clueless if they wanted to change up Anne Elliot that much. Reply Plums says: April 14, 2025 at 5:54 pm Modern adaptations are fine, but it\u2019s pointless if you\u2019re not bothering to translate the characters and plot faithfully into a modern context. Like, Clueless is the perfect example. Cher Horowitz *is* Emma if Emma were a 1990s Beverly Hills high school girl. Idk wtf Dakota Johnson was supposed to be in that movie, but it wasn\u2019t Anne Elliot. Charlie says: April 14, 2025 at 11:14 am My favourite adaptation of Pride & Prejudice is still going to be the Joe Wright version BUT I love Dolly Alderton and her book and TV series \u201cEverything I Know About Love.\u201d And the fact that she created the TV series gives me confidence that this version of P&P would do very well. I didn\u2019t like at all Netflix\u2019s take of Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion so hopefully they\u2019ll do a better job with P&P. Reply Jaded says: April 14, 2025 at 11:28 am The 1995 version of Persuasion with Amada Root and Ciaran Hinds is my favourite. It\u2019s so much like Austen\u2019s novel and the entire cast was perfect. Reply FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 3:26 pm Sophie Thompson is so, so, SO good in it! Her comedy is perfect. Corin Redgrave is also excellent as Sir Walter Eliot. He hits just the right note of ridiculous. Lau says: April 14, 2025 at 11:18 am I\u2019ll never forgive netflix for what they did to Persuasion, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch any other piece of Jane Austen\u2019s work. Reply Jaded says: April 14, 2025 at 11:19 am Nothing will beat the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version for me. It is almost word-for-word with Austen\u2019s novel and the casting was amazing. Julia Sawalha played Lydia to perfection, David Bamber as the odious Mr. Collins was hilarious, Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, all nailed the personalities of the characters perfectly. Any other versions I\u2019ve seen paled in comparison and I probably won\u2019t see this latest version. Reply SDG says: April 14, 2025 at 11:49 am I LOVE Julia Sawalha in EVERYTHING she does, Jaded. She was WONDERFUL as Lydia and as Dorcas in Lark Rise to Candlewood, not to mention as Saffy in AbFab. Reply QuiteContrary says: April 14, 2025 at 2:05 pm Totally agree, Jaded. It was sublime. And Austen fans who want a completely fun version should try \u201cBride and Prejudice,\u201d a Bollywood version. Reply Teagirl says: April 14, 2025 at 11:27 am Everyone talks about the 1995 TV miniseries which was wonderful, yet nobody mentions the previous miniseries from 1980 starring David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie. Rintoul was excellent as the slightly mean sneering Darcy and Lizzie had just the right amount of impudence. IMHO the series holds up well. Mr. Collins was very well cast as well. Good Lord! That\u2019s almost 50 years ago! Reply Jaded says: April 14, 2025 at 11:30 am I just got that on DVD \u2013 can\u2019t wait to watch it! Reply Teagirl says: April 14, 2025 at 3:36 pm I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy it @jaded, It\u2019s excellent despite the fact that Mr. Darcy does not go for a swim in his own pond in this adaptation. Phew, I\u2019ve got hot just thinking about that swim! Nic919 says: April 14, 2025 at 11:13 pm It was controversial for Andrew Davies to add that back in 1995 because it wasn\u2019t in the text. That said it worked and added to the awkwardness of the Darcy and lozzie encounter at pemberley. Becks1 says: April 15, 2025 at 7:41 am @Nic it goes back to what you said above, about how much Darcy abides by the social decorum of the time. The 2005 version tried to recreate this scene with the wandering among the moors in a white shirt scene, but it doesnt work FOR AUSTEN because that was intentional on Darcy\u2019s part. The pond scene is great because it sort of knocks Darcy\u2019s pride down a peg or two and creates an awkward encounter because a gentleman would NEVER be caught in such a situation by an unmarried woman not in his family. So there\u2019s a big difference between Darcy emerging from the pond in his wet shirt and Darcy wandering the misty moors at dawn looking for Lizzy. tamsin says: April 14, 2025 at 11:37 am Personally, I consider the BBC mini-series with Colin firth and Jennifer Ehle as the definitive film version of Austen\u2019s novel. Reply SDG says: April 14, 2025 at 11:38 am Holy Pride and Prejudice fatigue, Batman!! I LOVE Jack in Slow Horses (my current favorite show by miles) and his River Cartwright has broody tendencies. However I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s suited to Mr. Darcy. But we do NOT need yet another adaptation of P&P. Colin Firth & Matthew Macfadyen owned that role equally. Both of those adaptions are the gold standard of P&P and I don\u2019t see Netflix coming anywhere near them. The scene in the field when MMcF & Keira Knightley finally come together with the rising sun behind them is breathtaking & beyond romantic. It\u2019ll never be topped. Reply Dee says: April 14, 2025 at 11:42 am I\u2019m always willing to give a new Austen adaptation a try. It\u2019s always amusing to see the arguments that spring up on online forums about each version\u2019s \u201cauthenticity\u201d and who the real Darcy is, when I suspect Jane Austen would hate them all. Still, I treat these shows like comfort food. A rainy weekend afternoon, a hot cup of Earl Grey and an Austen adaptation on my TV are a pleasant combination. Reply Lady Digby says: April 14, 2025 at 11:57 am Oliver Jackson -Cohen was great in the regency era Mr Malcolm\u2019s List. He\u2019d make a fine Darcy. I saw the 1980 BBC version scripted by the wonderful Fay Weldon. That proposal scene!! Darcy should have edited it down to, \u201cyou must allow me to tell you that I ardently admire and love you!\u201d The William type snobbish crap about the degradation of allying himself to her common family should have been omitted. Although I suspect the charmless Will merely grunted, okay when she pestered him about setting the date after he\u2019d definitely promised her dad that he\u2019d marry her eventually!! Reply lorent says: April 14, 2025 at 12:37 pm Jack Lowden is great in Slow Horses, so I\u2019d check this out, but I\u2019m and Ehle/Firth P&P girl all the way. Like, we own the DVD set of it, that\u2019s how much we love it. Reply Lady Esther says: April 15, 2025 at 6:26 am Same gurl same. Sits on my shelf to this day Reply Gah says: April 14, 2025 at 1:02 pm Interesting casting. I did not like Alderton\u2019s book at all at all. I do not have high hopes for the writing. Reply Granger says: April 14, 2025 at 1:11 pm Oh dear, I think I might be alone in my distaste for the Knightley/McFadyen P&P. I thought KK did a great job. But McFadyen lost me when he was interviewed about the role and said he felt Darcy was just shy and uncomfortable and that\u2019s how he played him. Um, NO. Darcy was proud and kind of a d*ck. Also, in the book it\u2019s very clear Mr. Bennett has absolutely zero respect for his wife, and that she\u2019s rude and gauche; but in the film, Sutherland and Blethyn were like two young teens in love, she was just so dang cute and irresistible. Great acting, but completely untrue to the book. Still. I\u2019m up for another version. Why not? I love the book and it sounds like a good binge watch. Reply FYI says: April 14, 2025 at 3:28 pm Donald Sutherland totally phoned it in. Blech. Reply Cadbury Eggs says: April 14, 2025 at 1:25 pm Awww dangnabit. Don\u2019t want another adaptation, Colin Firth was perfect\u2026.but I\u2019ll watch this. I love Coleman and will watch anything that she\u2019s in\u2026 Reply Eurydice says: April 14, 2025 at 1:51 pm The vote among the women in my family \u2013 grandmother, grand aunt, mother, aunt, daughter and niece \u2013 all for Colin Firth as the superior Mr. Darcy. Reply Dee says: April 14, 2025 at 3:20 pm I actually liked parts of Netflix\u2019s Persuasion, the actress who played Mary was spot on and Henry Golding as Mr Elliott had far more chemistry with Dakota than Cosmo Jarvis. Reply ML says: April 15, 2025 at 4:32 am The 1995 version with Ehle and Firth came out on PBS shortly after I read the book. It\u2019s held my heart ever since. I liked elements of the movie (older clothing style to reflect when Austen first started writing, touching hands, the not-kiss) but I found other parts lacked depth and sometimes it became silly (Lady Catherine, I believe, arriving in the dark). Just looking at the faces, none of these actors scream Darcy (tall, dark, handsome, rich) and Elizabeth (fine dark eyes, fascinating, guy magnet, witty) to me. On the fence about OC.

Harry ( Tom Hardy ), the Harrigan family\u2019s fixer, keeps running into new roadblocks as he tries to head off a war between the Harrigans and the Stevensons. Last week\u2019s episode left Harry in a bind: Richie Stevenson (Geoff Bell, who looks like British Ed O\u2019Neill) gave the Harrigans a deadline to produce his son, Tommy. But Tommy turned up dead \u2014 hacked to pieces by a club manager, Valjon, wrapped in plastic, and stuffed in a chest. Valjon confessed to Harry that he did the butchering on behalf of Eddie Harrigan, that entitled little sociopath, who stabbed Tommy 50 or 60 times simply because he felt like it. Maeve (Helen Mirren), the Harrigan family matriarch, thought that was just delightful. The rest of the family? Less so. No one besides Maeve has much appetite for going to war with the Stevensons. But Richie didn\u2019t wait for an excuse. This week, he kick-started the war by blowing up Kevin Harrigan\u2019s house (luckily empty at the time) and sending two goons to take out Harry. Harry, being Harry, warned the goons that if they touched him or his family, their loved ones would be dead within 24 hours. It bought him just enough time to stash his wife, Jan (Joanne Froggatt), and daughter on the houseboat of a begrudging old mate \u2014 but not before Jan reminded him about a meeting later that day. That meeting? Not mob-related at all. It was on behalf of Harry\u2019s cleaning lady, who needed help getting her mother into an assisted living facility. Even while juggling mob wars, Harry found the time to negotiate with the facility manager \u2014 offering to send in a plumber and glazier in exchange for bumping the maid\u2019s mother up the waitlist. But while there, Harry clocked something important: an abusive prison guard from his past now living comfortably in the facility. Something tells me that room\u2019s going to open up soon. Meanwhile, Harry brought Kevin to meet Valjon, who told Kevin exactly what Eddie did to Tommy. Kevin was furious and called his father, Conrad (Pierce Brosnan), expecting him to rip Eddie a new one. But Maeve, gleeful as ever, talked Conrad down. She\u2019s thrilled with Eddie for recklessly endangering the entire family. Harry, always in fixer mode, hatched a plan. He and Kevin played good-cop, bad-cop with Valjon \u2014 already beaten half to death \u2014 convincing him to take the fall for Tommy\u2019s murder in exchange for the safety of his children. Valjon had no real choice. After ditching Detective Fisk, Harry handed Valjon over to Richie, who shot him twice but kept him alive. Richie promised a very thorough interrogation, and if Valjon\u2019s story didn\u2019t hold, the war would escalate. Maeve, of course, wouldn\u2019t mind a war. In fact, she seems to crave it. She and Conrad took a sauna together to strategize, with Maeve suggesting they should kill Richie\u2019s wife, Vron (Annie Cooper), just to inflict maximum pain. Conrad put a pin in that for now, giving Harry time to clean up the mess. We also learned that Maeve isn\u2019t fond of her stepdaughter, Seraphina (Mandeep Dhillon) \u2014 probably because she\u2019s a reminder of Conrad\u2019s indiscretion with a lap dancer. Maeve seems to prefer the Harrigan screw-ups, Eddie and Brendan, over Seraphina, who was approached this week by Brendan about a potential deal. Conrad told her to hear Brendan out, but under no circumstances to give that \u201cgobshite\u201d anything. But the Harrigans have another problem brewing: Detective Fisk, thanks to an anonymous tip, has found the body of Conrad\u2019s old friend Archie, who was executed by Conrad back in the premiere and hidden in someone else\u2019s casket. Whoever made that call is going to have Harry to deal with soon. I suspect there\u2019s a mole in the Harrigan circle. I just hope it\u2019s not Kevin, because I\u2019ll be devastated if anything happens to Paddy Considine, one of my all-time favorite character actors. One last thread this week: Kevin\u2019s wife, Bella (Lara Pulver), tried to blackmail her estranged father, the Prime Minister, by videotaping him offering a bribe to her client, Antoine. But Antoine turned it on Bella, keeping the footage to blackmail her . If she doesn\u2019t pay up, he\u2019ll turn the video over to her dad. Bella called in Harry for help, but not before once again trying to seduce him. There\u2019s clearly some history there, and while Bella seems eager to reignite it, Harry is (for now) trying to repair his marriage to Jan. And that\u2019s where things stand. My guess? Valjon won\u2019t hold up well under Richie\u2019s interrogation, and the war between the Harrigans and Stevensons will escalate next week, likely putting poor Vron directly in the crosshairs. A shame, really, since even Maeve and Conrad think she\u2019s great company. More importantly, I\u2019m hoping the one genuinely good person in this show, Harry\u2019s maid, gets that spot in the care facility for her mom. Let\u2019s see Harry use his powers for something that isn\u2019t pure damage control for once. \u2190 Previous Article | Next Article \u2192 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Gurman said Apple is working on a new headset that is both lighter and less expensive than the current Vision Pro, which weighs up to 1.5 pounds and has a base price of $3,499 in the U.S. Gurman said that Apple is also developing another version of the Vision Pro that can make a wired connection to a Mac, providing a low latency experienced. \u201cThe idea is to create an ultra-low-latency system for streaming a user\u2019s Mac display or for connecting to high-end enterprise applications,\u201d said Gurman. \u201cSome customers have been using the Vision Pro for things like viewing imaging during surgery or for flight simulators.

It's one of the best Apple TV+ shows for a reason, and we're all sad to see it go. TechRadar contributor Samuel Roberts called it a \"masterpiece\" , and it's one of the many reasons we crowned Apple TV+ as Streaming Service of the Year in 2024.

This \"omnigenius\" fallacy overlooks the crucial role of context in success. Leaders often struggle when switching industries, as seen with John Sculley at Apple and Ron Johnson at JCPenney, proving that skills are often context-specific, and transferring them is not always successful. Reuters Elon Musk Elon Musk \u2019s misadventures with DOGE might be the ultimate example of a powerful flaw in how we think about leaders. That\u2019s our tendency to believe skills and accomplishments are portable, that someone who excels in one venue will be just as impressive in others. I call this exceptional \u2014 if imaginary \u2014 superpower \u201comnigenius.\u201d In reality, though, success doesn\u2019t exist without context. While there\u2019s no pleasure in watching Musk make a mess of the US government, maybe it will help clarify the crucial link between the two. Musk and DOGE show how a leader can be empowered by the omnigenius fantasy. Musk has surely done remarkable things. For all Tesla Inc.\u2019s current struggles, it transformed the automotive sector. And it\u2019s almost impossible to overstate SpaceX\u2019s revolutionary impact on the space industry. Once he joined the government, though, the story changed. In just one notable example, DOGE fired hundreds of employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for the production and security of nuclear weapons and management of nuclear waste sites. But the Trump administration reversed many of the cuts less than 48 hours later, when it became clear what these workers did and how important their roles are. \u201cThe DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\u201d said Arms Control Association Executive Director Daryl Kimball at the time. Similarly, cuts to programs providing healthcare for 9/11 responders and survivors were later reversed, as were those to Social Security offices. Even DOGE\u2019s website had to delete all five of its biggest claims to savings after media organizations pointed out they were wrong. Live Events Whatever you think of DOGE, we should all agree that accidentally damaging the agency in charge of American nuclear weapons is incompetent execution. And Musk isn\u2019t alone. It\u2019s become routine to see people with private sector successes deferred to as they regurgitate Russian propaganda on Ukraine or spread debunked anti-vaccine theories. This isn\u2019t just about business \u2014 the omnigenius myth runs deep in our culture. In Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Comics Universe, Bruce Banner remarks that he has seven PhDs, an (absurd) shorthand for his multifold genius. (Having personally done just one, the prospect of earning a second could turn me into a giant green rage-monster, too.) On TV, how many times have you watched a character who\u2019s an expert in \u201cscience,\u201d do everything from sequence DNA to hack a computer? And don\u2019t forget the celebrities many of us trust to sell us everything from snacks to cars to prescription drugs. But outside of the arenas that brought them success, why do we listen to these people? And why should they get positions of power in areas where they have little knowledge or experience? The explanation lies in a cognitive bias known as \u201cthe Halo Effect ,\u201d a phenomenon where having one major positive quality tends to skew our perception of someone\u2019s other characteristics. That\u2019s because we often correlate unrelated characteristics, such as intelligence, attractiveness, social skills and loyalty. So if someone is, for instance, particularly attractive, there\u2019s a tendency to rate them as more intelligent, even with no evidence to suggest that\u2019s the case. The halo effect makes us attribute success solely to the person, rather than to the combination of that person and the context he or she inhabits. But context is, virtually always, overwhelmingly important. This is why leaders who switch industries usually struggle. John Sculley sold soda brilliantly at PepsiCo Inc. but nearly derailed Apple Inc. Ron Johnson revolutionized retail at Apple, then tanked JCPenney. In both cases, the CEOs\u2019 latter companies lost more than half their market value during their leadership . Harvard Business School Professors Boris Groysberg and Nitin Nohria looked at people recruited from GE (at the time the pinnacle of American management) to be CEOs of other companies. They found that the leaders succeeded only when the challenges facing their new employer were similar to those they\u2019d encountered at GE. Context is so important that it has a huge effect even when people move within an industry. Other research by Groysberg showed that when most star equity research analysts change banks, their performance drops because the skills that allowed them to excel were actually bank-specific. And my own research shows that leaders who come from outside of a company (as opposed to being promoted from within) tend to produce high-variance outcomes: Sometimes they succeed brilliantly, but more often, they are disastrous failures. Because of the importance of context, success in one area provides almost no information about someone\u2019s ability to succeed in a different one. It is possible to change fields successfully. (Deion Sanders, after all, played in both the Super Bowl and the World Series.) But the odds aren\u2019t good. So, stop seeing haloes. Being a great investor or CEO doesn\u2019t make someone an expert in foreign policy, biomedicine or tax rates. Success is important \u2014 but so is understanding that the limits of any one person\u2019s abilities are usually much narrower than we think.

After the White House increased tariffs on Chinese imports <counts> five times in the space of nine weeks, we then got a \u201cpause\u201d and an exemption on consumer electronics products \u2013 before the latest development. Namely, the White House yesterday said that the exemption, which covers all Apple products, was only a temporary one, lasting 1-2 months . However, there are three reasons why this is exceedingly unlikely to be true \u2026 Your series recap February 1: Trump imposes blanket 10% tariffs on all goods imported from China February 4: This tariff takes effect March 4: Trump increases the tariff to 20% March 12: This takes effect April 2: Trump adds a further 34%; China matches this April 7: Trump threatens a further 50% increase if China doesn\u2019t cancel matching tariffs April 9: Trump increases Chinese tariffs to 104%; China matches this Later the same day: Trump increases the tariff to 145% April 12: Trump exempts product categories covering all Apple products April 13: Commerce Secretary says this is only a pause for 1-2 months Two solid reasons Apple tariffs won\u2019t be reapplied Right in the middle of that timeline was when I suggested Apple products were likely to be exempted , as did indeed happen , and there are three reasons that is exceedingly unlikely to change. First, the escalation we have seen is clearly unsustainable. Every time Apple announces an increase to US tariffs on Chinese products, China responds with a matching tariff on US products. So far Trump has gone from 10% to 20% to 34% to 104% to 145%, and it\u2019s clear that there would be no end to this endless tit-for-tat even if Trump were to eventually hit 1,000% or more. This is the welcoming lecture in the Why Tariffs Don\u2019t Work 101 class. Second, the impact on both the US economy and the global economy has already been devastating. It\u2019s not just what has happened, but the sheer unpredictability of US economic policy. It\u2019s impossible for businesses to make future plans in an environment in which the rules can be dramatically changed on a weekly basis. Companies need to plan their production schedules months in advance, and plan capital expenditure like new plant years in advance; that\u2019s simply not possible in such a turbulent economy. Above all, what is needed to begin undoing the economic damage is stability. And a crucial third reason Third, and most important of all, the impact on the US bond market \u2013 which clearly pointed to a path into a full-scale US recession. Loss of confidence in the US economy led to a dramatic sell-off of Treasury bonds . In order to counter that, the US government has been forced to increase the yield (interest rate) on these, which has a knock-on effect on the rest of the market, making borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses alike. A sharp rise in credit costs is the quickest way into a recession, and even Trump had to admit that it was the bond sell-off which forced him to \u201cpause\u201d tariff increases. There has been a suggestion online that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was instrumental in coordinating a bond sell-off with the governments of the European Union and Japan, in order to force Trump\u2019s hand. As Snopes reports, the main source of this suggestion is a shock-jock with a reputation for conspiracy theories, so I don\u2019t personally put much stock in it. But planned or organic doesn\u2019t much matter: the effect is the same. Each time Trump tries to re-impose tariffs, that will reduce confidence in the US economy, which will result in further bond sales, which will push up interest rates, which will further damage the US economy. It\u2019s a downward spiral with no escape bar abandoning the policy which caused it in the first place. Trump\u2019s threats will either quietly go away, or he\u2019ll find a face-saving reason for changing course.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. By Gizmodo Deals Published April 14, 2025 | \ud835\udd4f Copied! \u00a9 Amazon Americans are rushing to purchase Apple products in bulk in anticipation of the soon-to-be-imposed tariff hikes that will substantially raise prices within a few weeks. Based on early rumors, prices for electronic devices are likely to double or triple so now is the best time to buy your desired Apple products at their current (and reasonable) prices. The most popular deal on Amazon is about the newest AirPods 4, which are selling for just $119 now down from their $129 list price . The discount isn\u2019t huge but it\u2019s a great opportunity to pick up Apple\u2019s latest wireless earbuds before potential price increases. See at Amazon The Best Audio Experience The AirPods 4 are a major leap forward in Apple\u2019s iconic earbud lineup as they combine advance tech with a comfortable design. Powered by Apple\u2019s advanced H2 chip, they deliver exceptional audio performance and a host of intelligent features that adapt super easily to your environment (whether you\u2019re commuting through noisy city streets or enjoying a quiet evening at home, it will adapt to any situations). These earbuds are very popular because of the Personalized Spatial Audio experience with dynamic head tracking. This technology creates a \u201ctheater-like\u201d sound experience by placing audio all around you, which makes music, movies and games feel a lot more immersive and three-dimensional. Complementing this is Adaptive EQ which automatically adjusts low and midrange frequencies based on what you\u2019re hearing. Active Noise Cancellation first comes to the AirPods 4 open-ear option courtesy of enhanced microphones and the H2 chip. ANC eliminates low-frequency background noise\u2014such as airplane propellers or heating and air systems\u2014before it reaches your ears so that you can enjoy your tunes or podcasts uninterrupted. For times when you want to be aware of your environment, Transparency Mode allows you to hear what\u2019s going on around you without having to take out your earbuds. Comfort has also been a number one concern in the AirPods 4 design (which is not really the case of the AirPods Pro 2): The silhouette and fresh inner design provide a comfortable and secure fit for even more individuals. The smaller stem houses the H2 chip and features a force sensor for easy playback and telephone control with the mere pinch of your fingers. What you\u2019ll also like about these AirPods is that they offer up to 6 hours of listening time on a single charge with ANC enabled and up to 30 hours total when using the USB-C charging case . A quick five-minute charge provides about an hour of playback so you\u2019re never without your favorite tunes for long. At $119 at Amazon, they are a great value but also a wise investment as tariffs may jack up prices in the future. Make sure you get yours asap.

All rights reserved. Trader Drew Cohen works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, April 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) HONG KONG \u2013 Stocks rose worldwide Monday after President Donald Trump relaxed some of his tariffs , for now at least, and as stress from within the U.S. bond market seems to be easing. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, though trading was still shaky , and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6%. Recommended Videos Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for U.S. customers of products coming from China. Such an exemption would mean U.S. importers don't have to choose between passing on the higher costs to their customers or taking a hit to their own profits. Apple climbed 2.2%, and Dell Technologies rose 4%. Automakers also rallied after Trump suggested he may announce pauses on tariffs next for the auto industry . General Motors rose 3.5%, and Ford Motor rallied 4.1%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 42.61 points to 5,405.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 312.08 to 40,524.79, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 107.03 to 16,831.48. But such relief may ultimately prove fleeting. Trump\u2019s tariff rollout has been full of fits and starts, and officials in his administration said this most recent exemption on electronics is only temporary. That could keep uncertainty high for companies, which are trying to make long-term plans when conditions seem to change by the day. Such uncertainty sent the U.S. stock market last week to chaotic and historic swings, as investors struggled to catch up with Trump\u2019s moves on tariffs, which could ultimately lead to a recession if not reduced. China\u2019s commerce ministry nevertheless welcomed the pause on electronics tariffs in a Sunday statement as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping on Monday said no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia , hoping to present China as a force for stability in contrast with Trump\u2019s frenetic moves on tariffs. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs rose 1.9% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It joined other big banks in doing so, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Perhaps more encouragingly for Wall Street, the bond market also showed signs of increasing calm. Treasury yields eased following their sudden and scary rise last week, which seemed to rattle not only investors but also Trump. Treasury yields usually drop when fear is high in the market because U.S. government bonds have historically been seen as some of the world\u2019s safest investments, if not the safest. But last week, yields rose sharply for Treasury bonds in an usual move. The value of the U.S. dollar also fell against other currencies in another move suggesting investors may no longer see the United States as the best place to keep their cash during moments of stress. Trump noted the moves in the bond market, which suggested investors \u201cwere getting a little queasy,\u201d after he announced a 90-day pause on many of his tariffs last week. That Trump acted only after the bond market made its scary move, but not after U.S. stock market began trembling, \u201creveals this administration\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased back to 4.37%. It had jumped to 4.48% on Friday from 4.01% the week before. Yields sank after the bond market got an encouraging update on expectations for inflation among U.S. consumers. While U.S. households raised their expectations for inflation in the year ahead, their expectations for inflation three and five years in the future were either unchanged or lower, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That\u2019s potentially good news for the Federal Reserve, which hates to see fast-rising expectations for longer-term inflation. Such expectations could kick off a feedback loop that drives behavior among consumers that only worsens inflation. The value of the U.S. dollar, though, remained under pressure. It slipped against the euro and Japanese yen, while inching higher against the Canadian dollar. In stock markets abroad, indexes climbed 2.4% in France, 2.9% in Germany, 1.2% in Japan and 1% in South Korea. In China, stock indexes rose 2.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after the government reported that China\u2019s exports surged 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last-minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat increases in U.S. tariffs. ___ AP Writers Jiang Junzhe and Matt Ott contributed.

Learn more. Mobile Hello, photo: My favorite pictures taken with Motorola phones I'm no professional photographer, but I love the way Motorola has evolved over the years. By Ryan Haines \u2022 Published on April 14, 2025 \u2022 0 \u2022 Ryan Haines / Android Authority I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Motorola phones in my pocket over the last few years. From the rock-bottom budget Moto G Play and Moto G 5G to the top-end Razr that I pick up again and again, I\u2019ve tried them all. Along the way, I\u2019ve taken my Motorola devices to neat places and captured scenes I\u2019ll probably never forget. I\u2019ve used a Razr Plus to take a photo of the original Razr queen, Paris Hilton, and I\u2019ve used a Moto G Power to document Bark in the Park at Camden Yards during the dog days of summer, and I wouldn\u2019t have wanted a different phone in either scenario. Well, maybe I would have \u2014 but only if I were swapping a smartphone for my trusty Fujifilm X100V , which doesn\u2019t seem like a fair trade. Either way, I hope you\u2019ll indulge me for a moment and look at what I\u2019ve achieved with Motorola devices at several different price points. And, if you really want to be floored by a mobile photographer, check out my colleague Rita\u2019s gallery of Pixel photos from 2024 \u2014 just don\u2019t ask me for her secrets. My favorite photos taken with Motorola phones Ryan Haines / Android Authority At first, I wasn\u2019t sure how to pick out the best photos I\u2019d taken with Motorola phones. I\u2019ve used so many different devices at wildly different price points, and I didn\u2019t know if it would be fair to weigh each image equally \u2014 especially when Motorola isn\u2019t a regular entry on our list of the best camera phones at the moment. So, instead, I loaded up Google Photos, entered \u201cMotorola\u201d into the search bar, and scrolled through to see which photos jumped out at me. Then, I could flag pictures without knowing exactly which device they came from, giving me a somewhat random selection from my many Motorola adventures. Next, I had to figure out exactly how I wanted to organize my gallery \u2014 a task nearly as difficult as finding the right shots. Or, at least, it wasn\u2019t easy at first until I realized that I could simply go for a walk through time. See, when I started to review Motorola phones, their cameras didn\u2019t do much for me. Back then, Motorola seemed to reserve all of its megapixels for the primary camera on its flagship Edge, leaving peripheral cameras out to dry with low resolutions across all price points. Then, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) arrived, and I finally had a reason to be excited about a Motorola flagship again. Sure, it did some important things like bring the curved display back to the Edge lineup, massively upgrade its charging options, and ditch plastic in favor of glass again, but more importantly, it finally offered a true flagship trio of cameras. Gone were the 2MP depth sensor and 13MP ultrawide sensor, with new 12MP telephoto and 50MP ultrawide cameras in their place. So, it\u2019s there that we\u2019ll start our trip down Motorola\u2019s memory lane. Admittedly, my shots with the Edge Plus (2023) might be the least adventurous of the bunch, but I also went into the review with the lowest expectations of recent Motorola devices. Sure, I knew the hardware had received a sizable upgrade, but I wasn\u2019t sure how it would translate to daily usage. As it turns out, it worked pretty well. Not only was I immediately impressed by the detail that the Edge Plus pulled out of areas like the wooden railroad ties, but I was also relieved to watch it hold onto shadows during a walk around my hometown. It didn\u2019t wash out the defunct train station, nor did it brighten the area under the record store awning. The changes felt more like Motorola raising its floor to the level of many of its closest rivals, even if the Edge Plus still had a hiccup here and there. I would have liked slightly punchier colors once or twice, and motion still threw the primary camera for a loop, but I suddenly felt okay going out with a Motorola device as my primary camera. The long-awaited return of the Razr series (after skipping a launch in 2021 and reserving its 2022 model for China) only further solidified my love for Motorola\u2019s new camera direction. I had a chance to take the Razr Plus (2023) on a trip out west to Colorado, and I was determined to get the most out of its expansive new cover screen. Occasionally, that enthusiasm turned into a photo with a strange aspect ratio, but usually, I was able to flip the phone halfway open on a morning run to capture the boulders that surround, well, Boulder. Perhaps more impressively, the Razr Plus (2023) reminded me that more megapixels aren\u2019t always the way forward. It packs just a 12MP primary shooter, yet the photo in the middle is among my favorites from the year and probably my favorites from all time. I\u2019m simply blown away by the amount of detail throughout the entire face of the boulder, as well as the spot-on colors from the mountains in the background down to the plants and shrubs much closer to the foreground. Of course, I had to attach a shot of an airplane wing because I\u2019ve taken so many of them, but something about the gradient of the blue sky makes this one stand out among my favorites. Although I\u2019ve used mostly flagship-equivalent cameras for my favorite Motorola photos so far, I\u2019ve also had good experiences outside of the Razr and Edge ranges. Last summer, I spent a fair few weeks with the Moto G 5G (2024) and the Moto G Power 5G (2024) in my pocket, going through everything from Baltimore\u2019s spring bloom to a 100-mile bike ride from one Washington Monument to another to a baseball game where every other seat was reserved for a dog. Above are three of my favorite shots to come out of that stretch, each unedited. To this day, I\u2019m not exactly sure how I managed to get the lighting behind the trees along the National Mall just so, but I\u2019m not about to complain, either. I like that Motorola shifted slightly away from its perfectly true-to-life color recreation for the shot, and I\u2019d say the cherry tree to the right is just as punchy. It\u2019s still not quite as saturated as Samsung\u2019s shots tend to be, so I think it falls in a comfortable middle ground of color. The shot of my friend\u2019s dog, Alma, is another favorite simply because I didn\u2019t use portrait mode for it. It relies entirely on the natural bokeh out of the Moto G Power 5G\u2019s 50MP primary sensor and wide \u0192/1.8 maximum aperture, and the result shows just how tough it is to resist giving her human food \u2014 I mean, look at that face. And now, here we are \u2014 close to the present. Motorola once again changed up its cameras for the launch of the Razr series in 2024, and it once again gave me one of my absolute favorite shots of the year (the one looking toward home plate at Camden Yards). There\u2019s something nearly perfect about every piece, from the cloudless sky to the slightly warm color profile to the just barely soft focus of my friend\u2019s head in the foreground. The main change that Motorola made for the cameras on its Razr Plus (2024) is that it ditched the ultrawide sensor in favor of a telephoto, which is what made a shot like the one of the original Razr Queen, Paris Hilton, possible. Is it the best shot? No, it\u2019s a little fuzzy, and I would love not to have other Razrs in front of me, but it\u2019s one of the better ways to commemorate one of the more fitting special guests I\u2019ve ever seen at a smartphone launch. The loss of an ultrawide camera made grabbing a shot of the Manhattan Bridge a little more challenging, as I had to back up much further on my morning run to fit the entire pier into the frame. These last two shots are also from the Motorola Razr Plus (2024), and I added them to show a little more of what the 50MP primary camera can do. I don\u2019t often hop into portrait mode, only because it frequently looks too artificial, but I think the Razr Plus nailed every last detail of my friend Andrew, from his hair to the lighting to the edges of his backpack. If I didn\u2019t know better, I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the image came from a flip phone. I think my best Motorola photos are yet to come Ryan Haines / Android Authority Perhaps the most exciting part about my walkthrough of many of my recent Motorola reviews is that I\u2019m convinced that the best is yet to come. I expect Motorola to largely stick with the same camera hardware when its next Razr Plus (2025) eventually breaks cover, but I anticipate it will come with an upgrade in photo editing ability. It\u2019s about time for Motorola to lean a bit heavier into its on-device AI features, which might mean its own version of Magic Editor and the ability to erase people and objects from your photos. We\u2019ve also seen just about every company decide to lean heavily into camera filters this year, with Samsung upgrading its set and Apple rolling out completely revamped Photographic Styles \u2014 on its flagship iPhone 16 lineup, at least. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Motorola do the same if only to offer me a little better control over its typically natural color profile. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see it partner up with a famed camera brand like Hasselblad or Leica, but the next real leap probably lies in Motorola\u2019s image processing. Until that day comes, though, I\u2019ll keep reaching for my Razr Plus (2024) to see if I can add to my gallery of favorites.

It can communicate with people and has a projector. Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images After years of demos - it was actually shown off over 5 years ago at CES 2020 - Samsung\u2019s bright yellow, BB8-esque, home robot is finally going on sale. The Korean company confirmed that Ballie will roll into homes in the US and Korea this summer, with a juicy AI upgrade courtesy of Google Gemini. Pre-registration is already live on Samsung\u2019s website , so it looks as if, finally, Samsung is serious about turning this longtime prototype into a product you can actually buy. I\u2019ve actually seen Ballie rolling around at various CES and IFA expos over the years and it\u2019s never really struck me as more than a glorified projector on wheels. However, thanks to a newly announced partnership between Samsung and Google, Ballie will be infused with Google Cloud\u2019s generative AI technology, Gemini. Combined with Samsung\u2019s own LLMs, Samsung informs us that Ballie will be able to \u201c bring personalized interactions and proactive home assistance to users.\u201d This means the ability to understand voice, visuals, and environmental data, so it can do more than just roll around and look cute and beam the 2nd season of The Last of Us on to your wall. It will, we\u2019re promised, be a mobile smart home assistant that can interact conversationally, offer things like styling advice, and helping you to create tailored environments in your home. \u201cThrough this partnership, Samsung and Google Cloud are redefining the role of AI in the home,\u201d said Yongjae Kim, Executive Vice President of the Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cBy pairing Gemini\u2019s powerful multimodal reasoning with Samsung\u2019s AI capabilities in Ballie, we\u2019re leveraging the power of open collaboration to unlock a new era of personalized AI companion - one that moves with users, anticipates their needs and interacts in more dynamic and meaningful ways than ever before.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 - Patch 8 Is Big, Beautiful And Sad On paper, it sounds like a blend between a smart display home hub, a life coach, a fashion consultant\u2026 and still a projector too, of course. Ballie includes a built-in projector, microphone, and speaker, so it can beam visuals onto nearby surfaces and respond to voice prompts, even when you\u2019re across the room. It will integrate with Samsung\u2019s SmartThings home platform, so things like controlling your lights, thermostat, or robot vacuum should all be on board. Samsung\u2019s been steadily working AI into its broader ecosystem, with the Galaxy S24 series already tapping into Gemini through Google Cloud. Samsung says this is all part of a \u201cnew era of personalized AI companion,\u201d which sounds ambitious, but also not totally out of sync with what other big tech players are exploring. LG showed off its own take on a roving home assistant earlier this year , while Apple, Meta, and Google are all reportedly tinkering with robotics behind closed doors as well. Amazon already has a bit of a robo-fail with Astro but is, of course, pimping AI for the smart home by way of the just-launched Alexa+. The launch timing may be locked in for the summer but we\u2019re still yet to learn the price which could, of course, make or break Ballie\u2019s success. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Writing in the Q&A section of his latest Power On newsletter , Gurman says that the Apple Watch will receive \"new interface elements here and there,\" but the changes won't be on the same scale as what's coming in iOS 19. The latter is said to be inspired by visionOS , which has an emphasis on translucency, glassy UI elements, subtle lighting effects, and includes rounded icons and buttons. The Verifier previously reported that watchOS will eventually have \"elements\" of visionOS, including a look that is bolder, slightly transparent, and with a floating aesthetic. Buttons, menus, icons, and other user interface elements will reportedly also be refreshed, and Apple is said to be \"working on several ideas\" for the Home Screen. The report did not say when the changes would be implemented, but Gurman seems confident that they will arrive as part of watchOS 12 later this year. Gurman reports that Apple is also planning to bring a new set of features to Apple Watch that it is branding as \"powered by Apple Intelligence.\" Unlike iOS 18, Apple Watch does not currently have Apple Intelligence because of the high amount of local storage required by the underlying large language models, and Apple is set to keep it that way \u2013 with the watch relying on the paired iPhone to deliver AI features. Gurman did not specify what the new features are. Apple typically releases new versions of its software for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV in the fall, around September, when new products in these categories are launched.

According to the press release by the Japanese company, the new Sony PS5 prices will come into effect from April 14, Monday. Sony said that the prices of PS5 have been increased amid a \u2018challenging economic environment\u2019, without directly naming Donald Trump's tariffs. Swastika Das Sharma Updated 14 Apr 2025, 04:53 PM IST Sony PlayStation 5 prices will increase from today. ( AFP ) Sony on Sunday said it had made a \u2018tough decision\u2019 to increase prices of its superhit gaming product PlayStation 5 by up to 25 per cent as the industry reels from the effects of Donald Trump's tariffs. \u201cWith a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, SIE has made the tough decision to raise the recommended retail price (RRP) of the PlayStation 5 console,\u201d the Japanese major said in a press release. However, the price rise of PlayStation 5 is just made for the Digital Edition and not the console for some countries, Sony said. The PS5 Digital Edition is a slimmed-down version of the console that comes without a disc drive. PS5 price hike: Who will be affected? Sony said that the PlaySation price hike will be implemented in select markets as of now. This includes markets in Europe, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Select markets in Middle East and Africa will also be affected by the PS5 price hike. When will the new prices come into effect? According to the press release by the Japanese company, the new Sony PS5 prices will come into effect from April 14, Monday. New PlayStation 5 prices The prices of PlayStation have been hiked by up to 25 per cent by Sony. In Europe, the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition will now be sold for \u20ac499.99. In the UK, PS5 Digital Edition price has risen to \u00a3429.99. In both the markets, there has been no change for the prices of the standard PS5 with ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive. In Australia, the standard PS5 with ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive price has been hiked to AUD $829.95, while PS5 Digital Edition will cost AUD $749.95.

The Sony PS5 Digital Edition will on the other hand cost NZD $859.95. Sony did not notify about the exact price change in Middle East and Africa but advised buyers to check with local retailers. How much does Sony PS5 Digital Edition cost in India? The Sony PlayStation price increase does not affect India at the moment. In India, the PS5 Digital Edition retails for \u20b9 44,990, while the standard PlayStation 5 costs \u20b9 54,990. You can buy a Sony PS5 from online retailers including Amazon, Flipkart, Blinkit and the Sony Center. Also Read | Mint Primer: With electronics tariffs off, what happens to iPhone in India?

Economic warfare, unlike field warfare, involves the entire planet, although at its core are the two most powerful poles of the global economy, the US and China, are now openly and \u201cformally\u201d pitted against each other, with the first blows from Washington having a corresponding response from Beijing. The White House and President Trump have once again chosen to stay true to what they pledged to do during the election campaign and have put in place a plan with the pompous but not at all optimistic end goal of a \u2018liberation day\u2019. The American president should make it clear that he is extremely talented at diagnosing a problem. Where are we today? Trump is not wrong that the biggest threat to the US and everything it has built over the last 80 years is Beijing. The US president has correctly diagnosed that China is not the country of the 1980s and 1990s, and has developed an economic and a trade power that can and intends to upend the status quo. The 47th US President, however, is attempting to act first \u2013 to take the first shot \u2013 and to start a global economic war, knowing full well that in doing so his own losses will be very high. Trump as a doctor would be an ideal pathologist, but he would have serious issues \u2013 to recall his own quote about \u2018patient\u2019 \u2013 with \u2018surgical\u2019 procedures. The US has moved to a Trump-inspired scheme again, talking about a 90-day \u201cfreeze\u201d to the entire world which of course is essentially the implementation of a common 10% tariff on all products of all products. Regarding China, Washington is constantly on the offensive and has imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing. It is worth noting that this rate applies to a huge range of products imported into the US, but not to Chinese cars, on which the tariffs exceed 180%. The White House has launched a battle with its big enemy clearly in its sights, but it chooses not to give details of where, how and, above all, with what intensity it is striking Asia. The US moves are indeed causing significant blows to China, but the point is that Trump and his own aggressive tactics can practically threaten Beijing for a long time by going \u201cCheckmate\u201d, but it is very difficult for Washington to reach this chess game in Checkmate. The Response For its part, Beijing has responded to Washington as many times as it has been hit with similar actions. Today Chinese tariffs are at 125% and for the first time in decades there is a rivalry in the US. Russia choosing to ignore US warnings in 2021 and ultimately invading Ukraine cannot be considered such a blow, because Russia does not have the caliber of China and the Russian military did not invade US territory\u2026 Beijing has seized the opportunity that for years it seems to have been waiting for and is responding not with provocations but by engaging in the field, in fact in the one that the adversary itself has chosen. China with four times as many exports as imports to America is far more \u201copen\u201d but, it seems, also determined to \u201churt\u201d if it is to inflict comparable pain. The \u201cx-ray\u201d The world\u2019s two largest economies have a trade balance between them which, based on official figures for 2024, was $585 billion. US data imports far more than it exports to China. Chinese imports to the US in 2024 were 440 billion with their exports being about a quarter less at $145 billion. The trade balance between the world\u2019s two largest economies was 295 billion and is in deficit for Washington, which gives about 1% of its GDP to Chinese coffers\u2026 This is not the picture of today, which is precisely why tariffs have been imposed by the US on China \u2013 and maintained \u2013 and by Joe Biden for the last four years. These tariffs even seem to have had an effect, as since 2016 and Trump\u2019s first term, Chinese imports to the US have fallen from 21% to 13% in 2024. Over the last decade, US dependence on Chinese imports has declined, but it remains very high, especially if one introduces into this mix Washington\u2019s huge fiscal deficit over the last decade (US debt exceeds $33 trillion). China and the US both account for 3% of total trade on the planet and that in itself \u2013 at first glance \u2013 may seem small, but in real economic terms it is huge. The balance But what do China and the US import from each other? The product that is by far the second largest US export to China is soy\u2026 For China, soybeans are super valuable, as it doesn\u2019t have the production it needs to feed the more than 440 million pigs it raises\u2026 Petroleum products and pharmaceuticals come in second and third respectively for U.S. exports. For its part, China exports a huge volume of electronics, computers, and toys to the US. Batteries for electric vehicles are also a major export. By far, however, Chinese mobile phones are Beijing\u2019s largest export volume to the US. 9% of all Chinese exports are in the mobile phone sector. Of these devices, nearly 90% are products of Apple, which is literally in the vortex of US tariffs despite being one of the top US companies in terms of both value, marketability and global recognition. Trump\u2019s moves and the trade war now raging openly with China has already cost Apple dearly, which has lost 20% of its share value in a few days\u2026 The consequences For the most exposed China, the tariffs will bring \u2013 and even if they remain in place \u2013 significant domestic and economic problems even this year. It is not unlikely that several large Chinese factories will close or suspend operations, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers unemployed. Beijing will have to organise a new rescue plan \u2013 bigger and more costly \u2013 than the one it put in place five years ago with the scandal and bubble in the construction sector. From this move Beijing is even likely to lose whole points of its GDP and the situation will be a little like that which exists when an unforeseen natural disaster strikes a region\u2026 The cost will be heavy, large, painful, but it won\u2019t last forever\u2026 On the flip side, in the US prices on several products will continue to rise. The national government will ask businesses to limit or even contain these increases, but at some point the entire burden will be passed on to consumers, who will either reduce purchases or choose lower value and quality products to meet their needs. Monetary battle But the real danger is that the current economic and trade war will turn into a currency battle. Already we have seen reactions that are not purely market related especially in the US. US bonds are already facing shocks and interest rates are already above 5%. The last time something similar happened was in 2020, when of course the whole planet was facing the first economic consequences of the pandemic. It is worth noting that for the specific developments of last week, US economists and analysts do not see a Chinese finger\u2026 despite the fact that China alone holds a huge percentage of US debt. In fact, all of the above seems to be an internal message from the US markets themselves to the president of the country, \u201cSystematic cultivation of instability is seriously damaging our economic health.\u201d In addition to the economic impact, Trump\u2019s tariffs have also brought upheaval at the diplomatic-political level. If two months ago someone had claimed that China, North Korea and Japan would sit at the same table to discuss how to deal with US attacks, few would not have declined Today Trump, needing all his country\u2019s partners more than ever, has already taken care to make it clear that their problems are no longer his. Europe has been getting worrying signals for months now and has taken care to distance itself and to review its own long-standing grievances. The G7 countries, traditional allies of the US, have been targeted by Washington and are looking for ways to fortify themselves on the one hand and to grow towards the East on the other\u2026 Trump, by the way he has moved, has essentially broken the \u201cglobal alliance compass.\u201d What is expected? China has made it clear that it will not remain silent this time, although on Friday it stressed that the \u201creciprocal tariff game\u201d has little substance except for appearances. Trump, who insists on \u201cXi is my friend\u201d, expects the Chinese president to get on a plane and go to Washington for full-fledged negotiations, a move that would amount to an admission of defeat for China and thus a scenario today more akin to science fiction. At the same time, China has absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in dealing its own cards around the world. The Sanchez-Shi meeting in Beijing at the end of the week may have slipped through the cracks, but it is tangible proof that the Union can talk collectively and that its members are moving unilaterally towards the East in order to reduce the risks as quickly and as much as possible, which is no longer a theory\u2026 The Union at the same time is also willing to take advantage of the situation, especially in the face of an ally that had no problem even raising a finger to the rule of law and putting it on the list of \u201crobbers\u201d of its wealth. >Related articles Mitsotakis: Political and economic stability is important in times of turmoil \u2013 I am optimistic, all the signs for the economy are positive Easter coinciding with the Catholics opens the best season \u2013 Greeks head to the villages, while foreigners go on city breaks and to the islands The impact of tariffs and\u2026Trump\u2019s ties worry the government The Gap Europe will also have serious issues with China, as what separates us from the powerful pole in the East is even more than what unites us, but any discussion makes \u2013 traditionally \u2013 the distances shrink.

Apple has reportedly cancelled the series following the finale of its fourth season set for this week on April 18. However, an updated ending for the finale will debut later this week. As Variety first reported , Mythic Quest\u2019 s cancellation appears to have surprised the creative team. The series had just wrapped its fourth season and debuted Side Quest, a four-part spin-off series, which began streaming on March 26th as well. The report also went on to provide a statement from the executive producers of the series. \u201cEndings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close,\u201d said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how drastic the update to the season four finale will be. However, it\u2019s a rarity to hear that cancelled shows are able to provide a bit of closure to the series for fans. Mythic Quest is a series based on video game development. Loosely based on Assassin\u2019s Creed developer and publisher Ubisoft, the series highlights the fictional trials and tribulations of a game studio working on a massive multiplayer online game. The series centers on Ian Grimm, played by Rob McElhenney and Poppy Li, played by Charlotte Nicdao. Other notable stars include Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, David Hornsby, Danny Pudi, and Imani Hakim. News of the cancellation comes weeks after it was reported that Apple TV+ loses over $1 billion USD (around $1.3 billion CAD) annually. Despite the many critically acclaimed shows like Severance, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, and more, Apple is eating sunken costs by operating its streaming service. P.S.

In spite of this potential crisis, though, Apple apparently has a plan to right the ship and get the Vision Pro back on track. At least, that\u2019s according to Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman\u2019s latest Power On newsletter . There, Gurman says that Apple is working on two new Vision Pro models that could shake up the device and potentially give it a new foothold in the industry. Neither of these models will be simple refreshes. While Gurman says that Apple had previously considered a few minor tweaks \u2013 like changing the headset\u2019s chip from the M2 to the M5 chip \u2013 Apple is apparently now mulling more ambitious plans. You may like Apple Intelligence finally arrives on Vision Pro, but it's the new iOS app that might turn heads Apple Intelligence coming to Vision Pro in April according to top insider, and it could arrive in beta later this week Instead, Apple is \u201cnow looking to go further,\u201d Gurman says, with one device that is both cheaper and more lightweight than the current Vision Pro, which should make it both more accessible to consumers and reduce the neck strain that can sometimes occur after long periods of use. The second Vision Pro in development is \u201cmore intriguing,\u201d Gurman believes. Supposedly, this model will connect directly to a Mac, which will allow for greatly reduced latency. Some Vision Pro headsets are being used in surgery and in flight simulators, Gurman says, which are two areas where reduced latency will be incredibly important. Addressing two key problems (Image credit: Apple) Interestingly, Gurman likens the second Vision Pro to a product Apple reportedly canceled in January : a set of lightweight glasses outfitted with augmented reality (AR) capabilities that would be tethered to a Mac. The ultimate goal for Apple is to create an entirely wireless pair of AR glasses that a user can wear all day, but it will take many years before that device is ready for prime time. Still, even if the next Vision Pro isn\u2019t as lightweight as a pair of glasses, anything that reduces its weight will be a welcome change. I don\u2019t own a Vision Pro myself, and one of the main reasons is that I\u2019ve heard the stories of the pain caused by wearing it for too long. If I\u2019m going to make a significant investment in a product like this, I want to be able to use it without risking soreness after just a few hours\u2019 usage.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors The other reason I\u2019ve steered clear is the eye-watering price, with $3,500 feeling incredibly steep when the Vision Pro is still in its early stages. I know I\u2019m not alone here, with multiple reports suggesting that sales of the device have been very slow . If Apple can address both of those problems, I might finally be tempted to fork out for a Vision Pro, particularly for its Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display mode . We've previously described that as a \"lightbulb moment\" for the device, given it gives you a massive 32:9 aspect ratio \u2013 the equivalent of two displays side-by-side. That would definitely be more enticing on a headset that's more comfortable, and also potentially not too much more expensive than buying an extra monitor. I\u2019m not entirely convinced yet, but at least Apple seems to be heading in the right direction.

Sony announced today that the cost of the PlayStation 5 is due to increase in certain parts of the world including Europe. \u201cAccording to an internal assessment memo by a major Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia, game consoles are still subject to a 145% U.S. tariff on goods made in China, which means products like Nintendo\u2019s highly anticipated new console are in line for a massive hit.\u201d Source Share this!

Article content NEW YORK \u2014 Operationally-focused buyout group, Ronin Equity Partners in partnership with Landon Capital Partners, announces the sale of Barron, Wisconsin-headquartered Heartisan Foods to The Gellert Global Group. The Gellert Global Group owns a specialty cheese subsidiary, Atalanta Corporation, which is one of the leading specialty food importers of high-quality cheese, charcuterie, deli meats, grocery products, and seafood worldwide. Founded in 1945 and under the umbrella of The Gellert Global Group, Atalanta is one of the largest privately held food importers in North America. Article content Article content Ronin and Landon formed Heartisan in June 2021 through the simultaneous acquisition and integration of three market leaders in specialty cheese: Red Apple Cheese, Barron County Cheese, and Cheese Brothers. North Country Packaging was acquired and integrated by the Heartisan platform in June 2023. The combined platform sells over 70 different cheese products in bricks, rounds, slices, and snack forms (including curds, shreds, sticks, and spreads), covering a range of flavors (tomato-sweet basil to ghost pepper) and types, from smoked cheese to kosher cheese. Sold primarily through the Red Apple brand, Heartisan is the fastest growing special cheese group in the U.S. with double-digit sales growth annually.

Article content \u201cTo turn Heartisan into a cohesive powerhouse, our investment partners embedded in with us, overhauled the back office, and helped us create a well-oiled infrastructure from processing to sales,\u201d says Lori Henningfield, Heartisan chief commercial officer. \u201cThat gave us the base to expand everything from production to products rapidly.\u201d Highly focused commercial and operational support are a standard part of all Ronin investment programs with several Ronin team members taking executive roles at Heartisan. \u201cThe benefits we\u2019ll be able to achieve with a diversified food group like Gellert Global\u2019s Atalanta make this sale the natural next step in our evolution,\u201d says Pratap Mukharji, Heartisan\u2019s chairman of the board. Article content \u201cConsolidating Heartisan with a top-tier industry specialist is the best way to maximize value for everyone,\u201d says Ronin Managing Partner and Co-Founder, David Feierstein. \u201cMore broadly, we\u2019re seeing a wave of consolidation deals in an exceptionally fragmented cheese industry,\u201d says Jesse Yao, Ronin\u2019s other Co-Founder and Managing Partner. \u201cWith demand at an apex for nutrient-rich dairy, we\u2019ve seen heightened M&A interest for companies in the cheese category.\u201d Article content As with all its acquisitions, Ronin financed the purchase with investments from a range of limited partners, in this instance including Cardinal Equity Partners and First Haven Capital. Ronin also partnered with the direct private equity investment firm, Landon Capital Partners, for the majority of the equity. Article content \u201cThere has been a limited capacity issue with all the Ronin deals we\u2019ve raised capital for, as is frequently the case with the best direct investment teams,\u201d says Matt Swain, Head of Direct Placements and Secondaries at Houlihan Lokey. Swain and his team have raised the capital for all of Ronin\u2019s funded deals. All have been oversubscribed by a factor of at least three. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with this exit,\u201d says Sundip Murthy, Managing Partner of Landon Capital Partners. \u201cHeartisan\u2019s superior growth and the successful sale of a domestically-focused business in a tough market for transactions illustrates what can be achieved with strong alignment in direct deals.\u201d Article content Article content Immediately before the current transaction, online cheese brand and distributor, Cheese Brothers, was carved out from Heartisan. Selling a wide range of cheese products directly to consumers, Cheese Brothers\u2019 annual revenues have quickly grown due to a loyal customer following. Cheese Brothers is being sold for an undisclosed sum. Article content Since the first quarter of 2021, when it began investing, Ronin has committed to five platform investments, comprising a total of 23 companies. From acquisition to date, annualized EBITDA at Ronin\u2019s five platform companies has risen 30 percent to $103 million, while annualized revenues are up 35 percent to $512 million. Article content Ronin has a current pipeline of close to 50 potential proprietary food deals with EBITDAs ranging from $3 million to $70 million. Ronin has signed a letter of intent for a purchase it expects to close by May and is likely to sell a second portfolio company later this month. Article content Goulston & Storrs and Katten Muchin Rosenman acted as legal advisors on Heartisan. Intrepid acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Heartisan Foods and the company\u2019s shareholders. KeyBanc advised Ronin Equity Partners in the transaction.

Pulling off the tab seals is nothing short of satisfying, and lifting the top of the box to reveal the brand-new iPhone is, at least to me, a thrilling experience. Well, this one unlucky AT&T customer didn't entirely get to experience the unboxing of a new iPhone as Apple intended it. The user is sharing their story on Reddit . Apparently, they got an unpleasant surprise by ordering a new iPhone 16 Pro from AT&T 's website (and after trading in their iPhone 13 Pro for a $1,000 credit) When they received the new phone and opened the package, they were greeted with a shocker. The iPhone box was reportedly missing its tab seals, which indicates basically it was previously opened. Hoping the phone would still be in a new condition, they filmed the unboxing to use for proof later... and found out that unfortunately, the iPhone's camera lenses were covered in dust. As any of us would do, this customer went to AT&T store to get a replacement. But they didn't get exactly what they wanted. Instead, they were told the store manager wasn't there so the rep couldn't do anything. Also, they were told that even if the manager was there, they wouldn't be able to offer a replacement without a fee. Receive the latest AT&T news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . The rep also said that even if the manager were present, they wouldn\u2019t be able to provide a replacement without a fee since it would be an issue only Apple could address under their warranty policy. This claim about it being an Apple warranty issue didn't make sense to me, but the store rep insisted. -Few-Poetry4641 on Reddit, April 2025 Then, presumably a bit frustrated, the customer called AT&T support and was told they could return the phone under AT&T 's 'buyer's remorse' policy, but would still be charged the sales tax. Which frankly, seems a bit unfair. In the Reddit threat, there are a few instances of people speculating that this might be a common practice to sell already opened phones. However, some of these comments are contradicted by other Redditors claiming if such a practice existed, it was due to a bad store manager and not AT&T 's doing. Whichever is the truth, the concerning fact is that it seems to not have happened only to one person as a freak accident. Unfortunately, another Redditor has reported a similar thing has happened to their wife. Recommended Stories This other customer says they ordered in-store but as the phone wasn't available, it got shipped to them. They reported the shipping box was sealed, but the tabs were torn off for the iPhone 16 Pro they got. Of course, they refused the phone, calling AT&T 's customer service. This user also, unfortunately, reports they'd seen other similar cases being reported online. In the same threat, another user also reports their new iPhone box not having the seals on it. However, they decided to keep the phone as they saw the battery cycle count was 0 and the phone hadn't been used. In their case, it was another new phone with a trade-in promo, this time, a black iPhone 16 Pro Max . At the moment, it's not clear if the customer will have to pay the fee to AT&T or if it could be waived somehow. However, one is for certain - the experience was far from the exhilarating one of getting a new piece of cool tech... at least hopefully, they will soon get a shiny new iPhone to enjoy and they will quickly put this incident behind them. I can't help but think about that incident with a theft ring and T-Mobile iPhones. At least, these AT&T customers have received iPhones in the box, while some T-Mobile customers who fell victim to a recent theft ring were delivered empty boxes. Like, literally empty . So there's always worse, I guess. We have reached out to AT&T for a comment and we'll update this story when we receive a response. Did you enjoy reading this article?

The upcoming release has been designed to make the tablet operating system more like macOS . ADVERTISEMENT According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , this overhaul comes in response to long-standing complaints from users regarding iPad's software limitations, especially given that its hardware has been outpacing its software capabilities for the past four years, since Apple Silicon chips were introduced. iPadOS 17 allowed users to resize app windows, but it did not offer an experience that is similar to macOS' Stage Manager . While the upcoming improvements are set to make iPadOS more Mac-like, and focus on increasing productivity, streamline multitasking, and app window management, Gurman emphasizes that users should temper their expectations for a full macOS experience. That makes sense. It's unrealistic to expect an iPad to offer the same convenience that its desktop counterpart does, some limitations are expected, especially given that the tablet relies on a touch-screen, while Macs have a keyboard and mouse, which helps users multitask, type, draw, play games, etc. with ease. macOS is notably not reliant on the App Store, but it is unlikely that Apple will allow iPad users to sideload apps, other than those in the EU region. Nevertheless, if true, the move to improve iPadOS in a macOS-like fashion reflects an important shift towards meeting the needs of professional users like graphics designers, editors, who have increasingly relied on iPads for tasks that are traditionally reserved for laptops. Apple is expected to reveal iOS 19 , iPadOS 19, macOS 16 at the Worldwide Developers Conference, which is scheduled to be held from June 9-13, 2025. Many fans are hopeful that this update will represent a significant leap forward, bringing much-needed improvements to the tablet's software capabilities.

Home News You are here Phones for rent: Is leasing about to replace buying? By Aleksandar Anastasov Published: Apr 14, 2025, 6:04 AM 3 comments Follow us on Google News Editorials This article may contain personal views and opinion from the author. It seems like we hear about price hikes every year or two these days. While affordable phones have become more reliable, they are still experiencing a slow but steady price increase. A recent report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman suggests that Apple might be facing challenges with phone prices, making the company consider subscription-based leasing for its iPhones once again. With other major phone manufacturers like Samsung exploring similar ideas, rising international tariffs, and the fact that everything is a subscription nowadays, I couldn't help but wonder whether we will soon be renting phones instead of buying them. The slow transition from buying to renting People tend to buy their phones outright or get them at reduced prices by bundling them up with mobile plans. That\u2019s still the case to some extent, but things started to change around 2014 when carriers introduced monthly payment programs that allowed customers to upgrade their phones every year without a large upfront cost. Apple took a page of the carriers\u2019 book and jumped on this trend by launching the iPhone Upgrade Program in 2015, which essentially turned phone ownership into a subscription. Customers who opted for the program paid monthly in exchange for AppleCare+ coverage and a new iPhone model each year. Receive the latest mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . Soon after, other similar programs started appearing. Samsung rolled out its own upgrade plans in 2016, which were especially popular in Korea and Europe, allowing customers to avoid intimidating upfront prices. Yet, renting still isn\u2019t the primary option customers go for when buying a new phone. Many still prefer paying the phone\u2019s full price from the get go or going for secondhand/refurbished models. Leasing, buying, secondhand: Pros and Cons Aspect Leasing (Subscription) Buying New (Outright) Buying Secondhand / Refurbished Upfront Cost Low or none High \u2013 full retail price (if no offers) Low to moderate \u2013 significantly cheaper than new Monthly Payments Yes \u2013 continuous until you cancel or switch programs No (unless financed separately) No ongoing payments (some refurbished models can be financed separately) Ownership No \u2013 you return the phone or buy it out Yes \u2013 you fully own the device Yes \u2013 you own the device outright Upgrade Frequency Frequent \u2013 often annually, built into the plan Whenever you choose Whenever you choose Convenience Very convenient \u2013 includes upgrades and support Medium \u2013 simple, but you handle upgrades or trade-ins yourself Medium \u2013 lower cost but you must vet the seller/device Included Extras Often includes insurance, AppleCare/Samsung Care, etc. Usually not included (must be purchased separately) Rarely included, varies by seller Environmental Impact Mixed \u2013 good if phones are refurbished, bad if encouraging overuse Neutral to negative if device is replaced frequently Positive \u2013 extends product life and reduces e-waste Software Support Lifespan Full \u2013 always using latest device Full \u2013 but limited to each phone\u2019s support cycle Shorter \u2013 may have fewer years of updates remaining Total Long-Term Cost Higher \u2013 especially if you keep leasing indefinitely Lower \u2013 especially if phone is kept for 3\u20135 years Lowest \u2013 but may require earlier replacement or repairs Best For Users who want the latest phone with minimal hassle Users who prefer long-term value and full device ownership Budget-conscious or eco-conscious users Recommended Stories Manufacturers are testing the waters It\u2019s clear that phone manufacturers see some potential in this model. While Apple stopped its iPhone Upgrade Program, the recent tariffs brought news that the company could bring it back. A more recent example is Samsung, which shared plans for an \"AI Subscription Club\" earlier this year . The program lets people in the country subscribe to a Galaxy S25 series phone for 12 or 24 months by paying a fixed monthly fee. According to the company, the cost is KRW 5,900 per month (around $4.09), meaning users can access a Galaxy S25 for just $48 over the course of a year. Google tested a similar program back in 2021 called \"Pixel Pass\", bundling Pixel phones with Google services. Like many of Google\u2019s experiments, though, it ended after two years due to low consumer interest. Will renting replace buying completely? In the U.S. and many other markets, carrier installment plans are already widely used. As smartphone prices continue to climb, leasing or subscription models could become even more common. For many customers, getting a $1,500 phone through an affordable monthly plan \u2014 often bundled with regular upgrades, protection, and additional services \u2014 has become the preferred way to upgrade. There will always be people who avoid subscription plans, but if the offers become highly attractive and more transparent (i.e. no hidden costs and fine-print conditions), there\u2019s a good chance that number will drop. It\u2019s also worth noting that consumers globally have become comfortable with subscriptions for services like Netflix, professional platforms and apps. Considering that, smartphone subscriptions are not that far-fetched of an idea. At the end of the day, a more widespread adoption of phone leasing depends on how affordable the monthly payments are, as well as clear and simple terms that users can understand. Leasing vs secondhand: affordability and environmental impact The secondhand market has grown tremendously over recent years. According to market intelligence firm IDC, the global market for refurbished smartphones grew nearly 10% from 2022 to 2023 and is expected to reach nearly $110 billion by 2027. One major reason is that phones now receive longer software support, extending their usable life with ongoing security updates and new features. And let's not forget that refurbished devices can be significantly cheaper, often up to 80% cheaper than brand-new models. But if phone leasing programs offer affordable monthly payments without hidden fees or complications, they have the potential to attract more users. Leasing can provide customers with newer devices, regular upgrades, and included maintenance\u2014benefits typically unavailable with secondhand phones. However, there's also the environmental impact of leasing to consider. A poorly managed leasing model could increase electronic waste if frequent upgrades lead to higher production levels. But if it's done responsibly, leasing could also support sustainability by promoting a circular economy, as it will refurbish returned devices for resale, which can reduce waste and help conserve resources. For instance, choosing a refurbished phone instead of a new one can reduce environmental impact by up to 91% , preventing the extraction of about 180 lbs of raw materials and the emission of approximately 55 lbs of greenhouse gases. At the end of the day, though, the attractiveness of leasing versus buying secondhand hinges on affordability and convenience. If done right, it could offer a practical and eco-friendly alternative to both buying new and secondhand. Conclusion: A hybrid future Phone leasing is unlikely to fully replace outright purchases or the growing secondhand market. Ownership still holds value, especially for those who want full control over their devices or prefer to hold onto a phone for several years. Environmentally conscious buyers may also lean toward refurbished models or long-term use to reduce waste. Still, we\u2019re clearly moving toward a hybrid market. As smartphone prices continue to climb and economic pressures increase, leasing offers a compelling alternative. Apple, Samsung, and even Google have already explored the space, and while not all attempts have stuck, the interest remains. In the years ahead, it\u2019s likely that renting a phone will no longer seem like a weird way to have one, but a preferred choice for a growing number of users.

When he first announced the tariffs on April 2, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives a president sweeping economic powers during a declared emergency to address \u201cany unusual and extraordinary threat\u201d to the national security, foreign policy, or the economy of the U.S. Citing \u201cmassive impacts that are likely to do severe damage to the global economy,\u201d the suit was filed on behalf of five companies by the not-for-profit Liberty Justice Center. They include wine importer V.O.S. Selections, pipe maker Genova Pipe, and a cycling apparel company, Terry Precision Cycling, among others. They filed suit Monday in the U.S. Court of International Trade. \u201cThis court should declare the President\u2019s unprecedented power grab illegal, enjoin the operation of the executive actions that purport to impose these tariffs under the IEEPA, and reaffirm this country\u2019s core founding principle: there shall be no taxation without representation,\" the suit says. The Trump administration did not immediately reply to Barron\u2019s request for comment.

In the video below, Matt Talks Tech delves into the standout features and innovations that make the iPhone 17 Pro Max a highly anticipated addition to Apple\u2019s portfolio. Watch this video on YouTube . Enhanced Design with Premium Craftsmanship Apple has taken a thoughtful approach to the design of the iPhone 17 Pro Max, focusing on both aesthetics and functionality. The device features a slightly thicker body, a purposeful change to accommodate a larger battery for extended usage. The rear camera bar now seamlessly matches the phone\u2019s color, creating a more cohesive and polished appearance. The use of a two-tone material finish\u2014combining aluminum, titanium, and glass\u2014adds to the device\u2019s durability while maintaining its premium feel. These design updates not only enhance the phone\u2019s visual appeal but also reflect Apple\u2019s commitment to addressing practical user needs, such as improved battery life and durability. Advanced Camera System for Superior Photography The iPhone 17 Pro Max introduces a significantly upgraded camera system, designed to cater to both professional photographers and casual users. The rear camera setup includes a 48MP wide lens, an ultra-wide lens, and a telephoto lens, offering enhanced optical and digital zoom capabilities. These improvements ensure sharper details, richer colors, and greater versatility, whether capturing expansive landscapes or intricate close-ups. The front-facing camera has also been upgraded, doubling its resolution from 12MP to 24MP. This enhancement delivers clearer selfies and higher-quality video calls, meeting the growing demand for superior front-camera performance. Additionally, the Dynamic Island feature has been refined, with the Face ID sensor now more efficiently integrated into the display, resulting in a cleaner and more immersive user experience. Powerful Performance with the A19 Pro Chip At the heart of the iPhone 17 Pro Max lies the A19 Pro chip, built on innovative 3nm process technology. This processor delivers a substantial boost in speed and efficiency, allowing seamless multitasking and smooth operation of resource-intensive applications. The 3nm architecture not only enhances performance but also improves energy efficiency, contributing to longer battery life. Connectivity has also been upgraded, with Apple-designed Wi-Fi, 5G modems, and antennas making sure faster and more reliable connections. Whether streaming high-definition content, engaging in competitive gaming, or working remotely, the iPhone 17 Pro Max offers a seamless and dependable experience. Extended Battery Life for Everyday Use Battery life remains a critical factor for smartphone users, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max addresses this with meaningful improvements. The slightly thicker design accommodates a larger battery, while the energy-efficient A19 Pro chip optimizes power consumption. These enhancements translate to longer usage times, whether streaming videos, gaming, or managing work tasks on the go. Apple\u2019s focus on battery performance ensures that the iPhone 17 Pro Max aligns with the demands of modern users, offering reliability throughout the day. This improvement underscores the company\u2019s dedication to creating devices that enhance productivity and entertainment without frequent recharging. Pricing and Additional Launch Highlights The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to be unveiled in early September 2025, with availability following later that month. Pricing for the base model is projected to exceed $2,000, reflecting increased production costs and tariffs. While the higher price point may deter some, the extensive upgrades and innovative features justify the investment for those seeking the latest in mobile technology. Apple\u2019s September 2025 event is also expected to showcase other exciting product launches, including the AirPods Pro 3 and updated Apple Watch models. These devices are designed to integrate seamlessly with the iPhone 17 Pro Max, further enhancing the Apple ecosystem and delivering a cohesive user experience.

Major Motorola leak teases details of multiple 2025 phones \u2013 including the Edge 60 series Motorola's new cheap phones offer flagship features for a quarter of the price of an iPhone 16 The Loop Earbuds in particular look like a break from the norm, with open, circular stems. This being Motorola, they're bound to be inexpensive and offer plenty of value for money, but they're unlikely to offer the highest levels of audio fidelity. Taking on the Apple Watch The Moto Watch 40, which launched last year (Image credit: Motorola) Judging by the appearance of the Moto Watch Fit, with its square-ish display and its fabric strap, this is designed to go head to head with the Apple Watch \u2013 perhaps specifically the Apple Watch SE 2 , which starts from $249 / \u00a3259 / AU$399. Motorola's most recent smartwatch, the Moto Watch 40, launched last year : it has a tall, rectangular 1.57-inch screen, up to 10 days of battery life between charges, and features such as heart-rate monitoring and sleep tracking. You can pick up the Moto Watch 40 for around $65 / \u00a365 / AU$150 at the time of writing, so the Moto Watch Fit would do very well to undercut that price. It may be substantially more expensive, while staying cheaper than the best Apple watches .

A few months ago I decided I could bleach my hair. I burnt it to such a crisp that I\u2019ve literally been wearing it up under a cap. That worked when it was winter but now it\u2019s warm so I needed a solution. I saw this product highly recommended on other sites and the reviews were good. So I ordered a tube. Used it twice now and OH. MY. LANTA . For months my hair has felt like crunchy noodles ready to snap at a moment's notice. After one treatment (left in about 15 minutes after shampoo, before conditioner) my ends feel soft!! After the second time washing with it, it actually moves like it\u2019s not damaged and it is visibly SO much healthier . Like seriously idk how they bottled witchcraft but I\u2019m going to continue to use this product even when my hair grows out. An absolute magical miracle potion! I seriously prepared myself to explain to the world that it doesn\u2019t work. But instead, I have the healthiest hair I\u2019ve had since being a home hairdresser. 10/10 for less then $10.

Promising review: \"This shampoo is the real deal. I\u2019ve struggled with a flaky, itchy scalp since I was a kid. I\u2019d shower/wash my hair and by the next day I\u2019d have itchiness, and by day two I\u2019d have visible flakes. Over the years I\u2019ve tried washing my hair more often and less often, I\u2019ve tried the apple cider vinegar washing, different scalp masks, and essentially any low costing remedy I could find online, but nothing ever helped. I started using this about two weeks ago. I\u2019ve been using it just as the instructions say \u2014 wash once, rinse thoroughly, and wash a second time, every three to four days, and let me tell you just from the first wash, the effect was immediate . There\u2019s no itchiness, even though I sweat a lot through my eight-hour shifts at work. I haven\u2019t seen a single dandruff flake since I first used it . Maybe it won\u2019t work so quickly or effectively for everyone, but this genuinely feels like a miracle product for me . I don\u2019t think I can ever use another shampoo after this. The shampoo has a gentle soapy smell and it keeps my hair smelling nice until the next wash.

Every issue is packed with art and design inspiration Delivered to your IOS or Android device Never miss an issue From \u00a39.99 View Despite Apple having lodged several patents for folding hardware, including even a foldable watch phone , years-old rumours about a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad have always seemed like a bit of a myth. But those rumours have been getting much more specific of late. We recently heard a suggestion that Apple plans to launch a $2,000 foldable iPhone next year. Now, it's being said that 2026 will see not only an iPhone Fold but an iPad Fold too. Two separate foldable devices in one year without waiting for feedback on the first sounds like a rash move. But what if they're the same product? A mocked-up render from AppleInsider of what a foldable iPhone might look like (Image credit: AppleInsider) The latest rumour comes from analyst Jeff Pu. 9to5Mac reports that he's claiming in a research note that Apple that will release both a a 7.8-inch foldable iPhone and an 18.8-inch foldable iPad next year. You may like Tri-fold phones are cool \u2013 but they\u2019re NOT the next big thing Next week could be a wild ride for Apple fans A hugely expensive folding device could be quite a niche product. Perhaps not so niche as the Vision Pro, but of limited mass appeal all the same. So releasing two risky new products in the same year sounds unlikely. But they could be two models of the same device. Introducing iPhone Fold - YouTube Watch On Apple likes to make its products sound like a new invention. Consider its late entry into AI. It waited to see how other companies' efforts were received and finally burst into the fray by revealing 'Apple Intelligence' as if it had just invented AI. Samsung's been making foldable phones for ages, and delights in rubbing that in Apple's face. And Google got on board with the Pixel Fold in 2023. Merely releasing a foldable iPhone or iPad this late after its rivals wouldn't be very Apple. Apple's folding devices are rumoured to have a disinguishing feature to set them apart: no crease. To hype that as much as possible, it would be more Apple if the tech giant billed this not as part of the iPad or iPhone family but an entirely new line of its own: an iFold, if you will. Get the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Folding phones already blur the line between tablet and phone, so it could make sense to market the tablet and phone as the same device in two sizes: a vanilla phone-sized iFold and a tablet-sized iFold Pro. This is all total speculation. Bloomberg's regular Apple crystal ball gazer Mark Gurman has said that he expects a foldable iPhone in 2026 and a \"a giant iPad that unfolds into the size of two iPad Pros side-by-side\" in 2028. Some are saying that either Gurman and Jeff Pu must be wrong: the foldable iPad is coming in 2026 or it's coming in 2028. But they could both be right if next year's 'iPad Fold' is simply a larger version of the 'iPhone Fold', while Mark's 'giant iPad' could either be an 'Ultra' version, or something else entirely (a foldable MacBook maybe?). It all means that autumn 2026 could be one of Apple\u2019s most exciting product seasons for a long time.

Gatsby\u2019s Murder Mystery Party The highlight of this past weekend was doing a murder mystery party! Our friend group loves a reason to get dressed up, and this was such a great party concept. We watched the movie a few weeks ago to prepare. Jay Gatsby Himself! I hadn\u2019t done a murder mystery before, but this is the one we did (after voting on the theme!) Everything in the kit is planned out for you so that even the hosts can participate. Thanks to Chava and Ivy for organizing! The decorations were perfect. My character was a singer / dancer, and I choreographed a special performance at the Cat\u2019s Meow for the night. Sean was my performance partner in crime. We had such a fun night! We started the party at 4:30 so it would end at a reasonable time and some of us could be on the soccer field by 9am the next day. Shoo Fly, Don\u2019t Bother Me! We had something die in the walls of our house last month. There was a bad smell for a few weeks, luckily during a time when we could have the windows open and air flowing out. (Last week it was back to freezing temps, so we were lucky when we had the smell we could air the house out!) We still don\u2019t know what it was, probably a mouse. The smell is now all gone, but there are BLACK FLIES hatching everyday from somewhere in this house! Disgusting and annoying. I\u2019ve probably killed or released via open window at least 100 of them! Harry Potter World In other news, as quickly as the flies appeared, my boys have gotten into Harry Potter! I\u2019ve been waiting years for this because Mazen has never been all that interested in reading the books \u2013 until now. Birch is watching the first movie on repeat while we\u2019re simultaneously reading it to him aloud in the evenings. Mazen is reading it, too. I told Mazen years ago if he read all seven books I\u2019d book a trip to Universal that same day. I read the series as it came out and have yet to visit Harry Potter World at Universal. And there is the new park opening this summer, so I think a trip is in our future! Also new to us: a fun routine / chore chart for Birch! I\u2019m planning to share it and write more in an upcoming post. Minecraft Movie I took the boys to see the Minecraft movie last night so Thomas could watch The Masters in peace and quiet. (We were so happy for the winner of the Masters!) The boys and I all loved the movie. It was very well done! Milk & Honey I had the chance to visit the new Milk & Honey at Barrack\u2019s Road for a VIP happy hour. My plus one for the night was Hillary in celebration of her birthday! We got to taste an array of cocktails, including this Biscoff cookie butter espresso martini! They have an $8 happy hour on weekdays. The menu is Southern-inspired with shrimp and girts, chicken and Biscoff waffles, crispy Brussels, and fluffy biscuits! It\u2019s a great spot before an event at JPJ, while shopping at Barracks, or for a family dinner. After Milk & Honey, we went back to my house to watch Survivor with Ellen! I procured Hillary\u2019s birthday cake while it was still available from Cake Bloom. The Persian Love has raspberry-rose Chantilly cream, almond-cardamom cake, topped with crushed pistachios and rose petals. So good!! Only available around Valentine\u2019s Day, I think. We had it with pink blush cider from Albemarle Ciderworks that Ellen brought! Sleep Study I\u2019ve started tracking my sleep with my Apple Watch and it\u2019s been fascinating. I\u2019m going to share some stats after I collect more data, but the nights I\u2019m testing are pure, alcohol consumed, alcohol + CBD, or only CBD/THC. I\u2019m using the Green Compass sleep jellies and Unwind jellies in my tests! You can see the products I\u2019m trying here with a $10 off code attached. Bird\u2019s Eye View Just a small note on how obsessed I am with my new Grand Highlander! There are new features I\u2019m discovering every day, but this parking camera is so cool. How on earth does it record this bird\u2019s eye view that makes backing into a parking space so easy!? Kath Eats Real Food I start almost every weekday with a green smoothie that Thomas makes for the two of us. Spinach, AG1 , vanilla protein, peanut butter. I have loved the ease and consistency knowing I\u2019m getting so much goodness in the AM. You can see our everyday recipe in this post . Lunches Sardine sampler! I like my sardine salad with chips or crackers. I\u2019ve been making it with Greek yogurt or cottage cheese and just a little bit of mayo. Scrambled Egg Sando I\u2019m not the biggest fan of deli meat, but I love eggs! Plus fig spread, cheddar, and arugula. Botanical Their crispy cauliflower is one of the best foods in town! Dinners Loved this Blue Apron Harissa Beef Pitas with Tzatziki, Feta & Mint. \u201cTake out\u201d from Whole Foods \u2013 rotisserie chicken, mac and cheese, and a homemade salad. Blue Apron Spicy Panko & Pistachio-Crusted Cod with Roasted Tomato Farro & Asparagus CHEESE! My favorite food. This cheese from Whole Foods is my all time fave for happy hour. Friends night at Brazos + Cheese dip! Loved the spicy shrimp taco (a first for me). I have a week of work travel coming up right after Easter that I\u2019m excited about. Heading to Austin, TX for a one night stay, too! Reader Interactions Previous Post Affordable Home Decor For Spring Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Offers like this don't come along often from the iPhone giant, though it's fair to say it's one of the few best streaming services that still maintain its free trial period. Of course, when claiming this offer, you will bypass the 7-day Apple TV Plus free trial \u2013 but who really cares when you're getting such a good saving?!

We've also seen the long anticipated Severance Season 2 finally drop onto the service, now available to watch in full, with a second outting for The Buccaneers on the horizon too in June, starring Gossip Girl alumni Leighton Meester. Seth Rogen's The Studio has also made a fan out of CinemaBlend 's Senior Content Producer Adam Holmes, while writer Alexandra Ramos is prepared to go to bat for an underrated show, Shrinking . With plenty of raved about and lesser known shows in its roster, Apple TV Plus isn't slowing down its production of big budget originals either. Season 2 of Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters has just wrapped , with plenty of hype building for Dark Matter Season 2 , as well.

By HANNAH BROWN APRIL 14, 2025 13:50 A scene from 'Alex is Lovesick.' (photo credit: YES) The Israeli Movie Channel on Yes is featuring a tribute to Yitzhak Shani, one of Israel\u2019s great veteran movie producers, on his 90th birthday, which falls on April 14. On April 19, it will screen several of his films in an all-day program. Shani, who started out as author/director Ephraim Kishon\u2019s lawyer and produced many of the beloved Israeli classics of the 1980s and earlier, now owns the Lev Cinemas chain . The channel will show Alex is Lovesick (1986), directed by Boaz Davidson, arguably Shani\u2019s most famous film, in its Private Screening series, where the producer will watch his film and comment on it. This dramedy tells the story of a boy (Eitan Sneh), growing up in a typical Polish family in Israel in the 1950s. He falls for his Aunt Lola (Sharon Hacohen), who arrives from Europe to search for her lost love. Yosef Shiloach plays the family\u2019s kooky tenant. Another classic Shani produced, also directed by Davidson, is Azit, the Paratrooper Dog (1972), which will also be included in the tribute. Azit is a friendly neighborhood dog with military training who ends up going behind enemy lines to rescue soldiers from terrorists. They really don\u2019t make them like this anymore. If your children are not too jaded to watch a movie that doesn\u2019t have great production values by today\u2019s standards and is generally a bit dated, you should introduce them to this film. It\u2019s a must for dog lovers. Hacks \u2013 Hot VOD, Next TV, Yes VOD, Sting+ If you\u2019re trying to figure out what to watch now at the end of season three of The White Lotus, the most uncannily engrossing series in recent years, there are a few options on the horizon. Season four of Hacks is coming up on Hot VOD, Next TV, Yes VOD, and Sting+ starting April 11, and the series will be broadcast on Saturdays starting April 12 on Hot 3 at 10 p.m. Hacks is a comedy series about Deborah Vance (Jean Smart), a pioneering female stand-up, and her 25-year-old writer, Ava (Hannah Einbinder), who has been canceled for an ill-considered quip. The two have ratcheted up the tension between them higher than ever now that Ava managed to secure the head writer job on Deborah\u2019s new late-night show at the end of the previous season. I wasn\u2019t really sure at the end of the third season that we needed another one, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed Smart in this role, for which she has won three Emmys. Jon Hamm in 'Your Friends & Neighbors.' (credit: Apple TV+) The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Last of Us \u2013 Hot, Next, Yes I stopped watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale back in season two, when a character I liked had some body part amputated and all the torture became too relentless, but it has a loyal following, and the first episode of season six, the final one, has just started running on Wednesdays on Hot 3 and is also on Hot VOD and Next TV. If zombie shows that aren\u2019t really about the zombies are your thing, the second season of The Last of Us is coming to Cellcom TV, Hot HBO, Hot VOD, and Next TV, and Yes VOD and Sting+ on April 14. There\u2019s a five-year time jump between the end of the previous season and the new one, and a few twists in store for fans. Your Friends and Neighbors \u2013 Apple TV+ \u201cYou have this very strange mix of confidence and low self-esteem,\u201d says a young woman to Jon Hamm , who plays Coop, the hero of Your Friends and Neighbors, in the opening episode of the new series, which starts streaming on Apple TV+ on April 11. She could be describing Don Draper, the anti-hero Hamm portrayed on Mad Men, one of the gems of television\u2019s new golden age. It seems strange to think that in May, it will be a full decade since that series ended its run, and Hamm seemed poised for superstardom. But over the last decade, this comedian in the body of a leading man has stuck mainly to capers, such the Fletch movies, and comedies, like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, as well as voice acting for cartoons. Your Friends and Neighbors is mostly a caper series, recycling the trope that people seem to love \u2013 about middle-class people (or in this case, upper middle-class ones) who are forced into a life of crime to support themselves the way they\u2019re used to being after they suffer a reversal of fortune. That was the basic story behind Weeds, Ozark, Good Girls, and so many other movies and series. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now In this series, Coop is a hedge-fund manager reeling from a divorce after his wife (Amanda Peet) cheats on him with a friend. He makes the mistake of having a one-night stand with a young woman who works at his company. Faster than you can polish a Rolex, his smarmy boss (Corbin Bernsen, who played Arnie Becker on L.A. Law) fires him and freezes his stock options, reminding him that he can\u2019t work for any competing firms for two years. At a garden party, he wanders through the home of one of his neighbors and realizes how much expensive stuff they have just lying around. It\u2019s hard to imagine that someone could have so many watches that cost $200,000 that they won\u2019t notice if one is missing, but according to this series, that\u2019s the case. Soon, he is grabbing up some of these luxury goods and selling them to a tough-talking Bronx grandmother (Randy Danson) who runs a pawnshop, and trying to figure out how much more he needs to sell to get by. He also has to figure out what\u2019s going on with his on-again, off-again girlfriend (Olivia Munn of The Newsroom, who has been very ill with cancer for a couple of years but who looks great here). Mad Men fans will recall that no one is better than Jon Hamm at playing resentful befuddlement, and he gives it his all here. The writing in the series aims high, for the snappiness of legendary crime writer Elmore Leonard, but can\u2019t make it and the script is talky and obvious. At least a lot of the dialogue is delivered in Hamm\u2019s laidback, sexy voice. A Complete Unknown, The Substance \u2013 buy or rent If you enjoyed the recent Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, and know that you\u2019ll want to see it again, it\u2019s already available to buy on Apple TV+ for about the same price as a movie ticket, and will be available to rent in May at a lower price. Another movie you may have missed in theaters, The Substance, can be rented on Apple now. It\u2019s a horror movie about the lengths a washed-up former movie star, played memorably by Demi Moore, will go to look younger. She gets a tip that she should inject herself with the titular substance, which will make her look like Margaret Qualley for seven days, and then she\u2019ll go back to being herself for another week. Soon, her younger self decides to stop sharing the spotlight and all hell breaks loose.

Despite a 3% market growth in Q1, Counterpoint Research anticipates a market decline this year due to economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump. Reuters Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday. Counterpoint expects the smartphone market to decline this year, due to economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump. Trump's back-and-forth tariffs and escalation of global trade tensions has resulted in a worsening economic outlook and the possibility of stronger inflation. A volatile macroeconomic environment can cause consumers to postpone the purchase of mobile phones, unsettling the supply chain and increasing trade risks which can negatively impact the market, the report said. \"As per our current estimates, the tariff announcement did not lead to a major demand increase because of the uncertainty around tariffs and policy. Since Tariffs were announced in April, it did not impact iPhone demand in Q1 2025,\" said Ankit Malhotra, senior research analyst at Counterpoint. Live Events The global smartphone market grew 3% in the first quarter of 2025, but Counterpoint expects the overall market to decline this year. Samsung followed Apple with 18% market share. Xiaomi also continued its sales momentum while vivo took the fourth spot and OPPO came in at fifth.

Writing in his latest Power On newsletter , Gurman says that upcoming new versions of Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset are a \"stepping stone\" towards Cook's ultimate decade-long goal of making AR glasses \u2013 lightweight spectacles that users can wear all day and which overlay graphics on the real world. Cook has apparently made the glasses a \"top priority\" for the company. \"Tim cares about nothing else,\" Gurman quotes a person with knowledge of the matter as saying. \"It's the only thing he's really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.\" Meta is currently developing true AR glasses, and has already prototyped a version of the device it envisions bringing to mass market, dubbed Orion . Gurman notes that it will take \"many years\" for true AR glasses to be ready, with several technologies still needing to be perfected, including high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip, and a tiny battery that can provide all-day power. Meta's non-AR Ray-Ban glasses have reportedly been a surprise hit. These glasses are for taking pictures and conversing with an AI assistant. Apple is said to have discussed the possibility of making similar glasses to compete in the same space. Apple's rationale seems to be that creating smart glasses could be a precursor to developing true AR glasses further in the future. Apple is also said to be adding AI-enabled cameras to the Apple Watch and AirPods over the next couple of years. There have been rumors about Apple's work on AR glasses \u2013 aka Apple Glass \u2013 for almost 10 years now , and the Vision Pro headset is what Apple built because the technology doesn't yet exist for the kind of augmented reality glasses that Apple is aiming for. Gurman has previously reported that Apple is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces, and that the company is working on a version of visionOS that will run on glasses. Codenamed \"Atlas,\" the studies are being led by Apple's Product Systems Quality team, part of the hardware engineering division.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST Apple took the top spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter on the back of the iPhone 16e's launch and strong demand in countries such as Japan and India, data from Counterpoint Research showed on Monday. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Counterpoint expects the smartphone market to decline this year, due to economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump. Trump's back-and-forth tariffs and escalation of global trade tensions has resulted in a worsening economic outlook and the possibility of stronger inflation. A volatile macroeconomic environment can cause consumers to postpone the purchase of mobile phones, unsettling the supply chain and increasing trade risks which can negatively impact the market, the report said. KEY QUOTE \"As per our current estimates, the tariff announcement did not lead to a major demand increase because of the uncertainty around tariffs and policy. Since Tariffs were announced in April, it did not impact iPhone demand in Q1 2025,\" said Ankit Malhotra, senior research analyst at Counterpoint. BY THE NUMBERS The global smartphone market grew 3 per cent in the first quarter of 2025, but Counterpoint expects the overall market to decline this year. Samsung followed Apple with 18 per cent market share. Xiaomi also continued its sales momentum while vivo took the fourth spot and OPPO came in at fifth.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : Apple is facing two class-action lawsuits in the US and Canada over its delayed AI-powered Siri features, after hyping them in ads and pushing iPhone 16 upgrades. Behind the scenes, reports reveal Apple\u2019s Siri demos were largely fictional, with internal chaos and budget cuts leaving the assistant far from ready. When Apple first introduced Siri, it was supposed to be one of the company\u2019s crowning jewels. A smart digital assistant that could do all sorts of things on behalf of the user. These days, Siri is starting to become a liability as Apple is facing more lawsuits over the delayed Siri features it promised. Siri lawsuits After promising a shiny, AI-powered version of Siri under Apple Intelligence, the company ended up delaying the entire rollout to next year. Naturally, this didn\u2019t sit well with iPhone 16 buyers. Many upgraded their devices, expecting to use these new features right away. As it turns out, they\u2019ll be waiting an entire year to see what Apple\u2019s revamped voice assistant can actually do. That frustration has now exploded into not one but two class-action lawsuits. In the US, two plaintiffs claim they were misled by Apple\u2019s aggressive marketing. They are saying they would never have bought the iPhone 16 if they knew the Siri upgrades were vaporware. Over in Canada, a separate lawsuit is playing out in British Columbia, making similar allegations of false advertising. Apple even pulled an ad featuring Bella Ramsey hyping up the new Siri. Both lawsuits are now demanding damages. If the courts side with the plaintiffs, Apple could be on the hook for payouts to every iPhone 16 owner who bought the device expecting the next-gen Siri experience. Apple\u2019s Siri woes It\u2019s very worrying to see Apple headed down this path. A report by The Information reveals the chaos behind the scenes that landed Apple in this mess. For starters, the Siri demos Apple showed to the public were more or less a work of fiction. The marketing team apparently did not consult with the team working on Siri. The Siri team was surprised to find out about these new features that they were never even working on. It also shows how some of Apple\u2019s senior leaders dismissed the utility behind AI like ChatGPT. At least until it was too late. One report even suggested that when John Giannandrea, Apple\u2019s head of AI, wanted to upgrade the company\u2019s ageing 50,000 GPUs to make it better when it comes to developing AI capabilities, Apple\u2019s finance chief, Luca Maestri, slashed that budget to less than half . This is despite Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, giving it the green light.

And then that excitement turned to bitter recrimination when the company revealed that games for the new system could cost as much as $80, even if you choose a digital rather than physical copy. Oh and then they announced that the April 9 preorders were delayed \u201cto assess the potential impact of tariffs.\u201d This financial bombshell was especially ill-timed because it\u2019s become clear that the Switch 2 is considerably less innovative than its more affordable predecessor. Many of Nintendo\u2019s hits have achieved success thanks to a fun gimmick or point of difference: the DS\u2019s twin screens, the Wii\u2019s motion controls, and the Switch\u2019s twin function as a handheld and big-screen console. Even the Wii U, which flopped, at least attempted something new with its asymmetric controllers. But aside from a cursory (sorry) mouse mode for the Joy-Cons, the Switch 2 appears to just do what the Switch did with better specs. Then again, \u201cdoing the same thing with better specs\u201d is a phrase that could have been written for Apple, especially its all-conquering iPhone product line. Regular readers will be well aware of the exasperating pattern : early rumors hint at a dramatic revamp and startling new features before reality bites and the new iPhone ends up being much the same as the previous model. That certainly appears to be the case this year, with the big redesign predicted earlier in the cycle now looking considerably less radical and the long-awaited shake-up now expected in 2027 . A wide camera module probably isn\u2019t going to be enough for the iPhone 17 to blow your socks off. These increasingly consistent reports about the iPhone 17 arrive, like the Switch 2 price reveal, at an inconvenient time. Because, thanks to on-again, off-again tariffs on goods imported from China, where Apple makes most of its iPhones, the company may have to bite the bullet this year and increase prices or at the very least hike the low end by bumping the starting storage . A 40 percent price bump is a lot easier to swallow if the product is 40 percent better, but if it\u2019s largely the same\u2026 Well, let\u2019s just say that being expensive and boring at the same time is not a good combination. Apple couldn\u2019t realistically have seen this situation coming, but I still feel like this is a crisis of its own making. Year after year, the company has changed the iPhone as little as it possibly can, in order to save money, focus engineering on other projects such as Vision Pro, and leave room for further upgrades in the future. It\u2019s been like an expert racing driver, pushing as close to the barriers as possible for maximum efficiency. But when you do that, you make yourself vulnerable to even the smallest of outside factors, and a political gust of wind just made a crash more likely. Betting against Apple (or Nintendo, for that matter) is a fool\u2019s errand, and my assumption is that Tim Cook will find a way to make this work. He\u2019s already lobbied his way to a temporary exemption , and may yet perform logistical miracles ramping up production in India and Brazil. But above all, I hope Apple will learn its lesson and stop taking iPhone customers for granted. Foundry Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup. We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it\u2019s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too. Have your say We received an interesting and thoughtful response to last week\u2019s Apple Breakfast on the rumored iOS redesign , and I\u2019d like to quote from it here. \u201cYour apprehension toward the anticipated iOS redesign appears to stem from a preference for the familiar,\u201d writes Gregg from Denver, CO. \u201cHowever, embracing change is essential for technological advancement. Consider the evolution of language: languages that fail to adapt risk obsolescence. Latin, once dominant, has faded from common discourse due to its stagnation. Similarly, operating systems must evolve to remain relevant and meet users\u2019 changing needs. \u201cHistorically, iOS redesigns have led to significant improvements. For instance, iOS 7\u2019s overhaul introduced a cleaner, more intuitive interface that many users appreciated. While initial reactions were mixed, the changes ultimately set the stage for future innovations. Furthermore, redesigns can enhance user engagement. Studies have shown that improvements in UX/UI design, such as streamlined navigation and faster load times, can drastically reduce frustration and abandonment, encouraging users to engage more deeply with the operating system. \u201cIn the realm of technology, stagnation is synonymous with decline. As technophiles, we should welcome change that propels us toward more efficient and user-friendly experiences.\u201d Trending: Top stories Next-gen CarPlay is the broken Apple promise that foreshadowed the Siri fiasco .

Do you remember the last time you used a technology that made your head go boom? Boom, as in, \u201cThis changes everything; things will never be the same, and we will use this technology forever?\u201d Is that physical and intellectual feeling that you experience something magical, permanent, and life-changing? I remember the times it\u2019s happened to me. I recall the first time I used an Internet browser. The first time I held a smartphone with apps in my hands. And the first time I connected to the cloud. I\u2019ve been a technologist and entrepreneur for nearly twenty years in Silicon Valley. Boom, I know, doesn\u2019t happen all that often. But it\u2019s happening now. The marvel this time? It\u2019s agentic AI. Agentic AI is an advanced form of artificial intelligence that acts autonomously, making decisions and performing tasks without constant human guidance. It actively works on behalf of businesses while continuously learning and adapting. This goes well beyond the capabilities of more familiar generative AI technology. If you\u2019ve never used it, you\u2019ll experience a boom when you do. I\u2019m convinced agentic AI will have a breakout moment in 2025\u2014the kind that will reverberate for years to come. Here\u2019s why. The Agentic AI Moment What\u2019s happening now in agentic AI feels similar to the early days of cloud computing, when a small group of pioneering companies first recognized its transformative potential. I recognized this in 2009 when I first landed in San Francisco. Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had launched the App Store a few years earlier, and cloud computing was beginning to take shape. By my estimation, there were more than 30,000 independent software vendors (ISVs), but only 100 or so that could be considered truly cloud-native application companies. I marveled at how Salesforce and Workday led the charge and then at how Shopify, Cloudflare, and others followed. What started as a small base of standout cloud-native applications quickly grew into a movement that was to be felt worldwide. The experience taught me to spot signals of transformative change. Unlike previous technological shifts, however, agentic AI grows stronger with each implementation and with each insight shared across the ecosystem. The pioneers who join this movement today won\u2019t just be early adopters\u2014they\u2019ll be the architects of a new era in business technology. Early innovations are emerging, pioneering companies are taking shape and the economic potential is staggering. McKinsey and Co. has estimated that generative AI alone could unlock $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion of value annually. For perspective, that\u2019s larger than the GDPs of Japan and Italy, and nearly twice the size of the global auto industry. The estimated range of total economic potential of AI, which includes analytical AI, machine learning and deep learning, could be $15.5 trillion to $22.9 trillion annually by 2040, according to McKinsey. Why Agentic AI Is The Future Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift on several fronts. This includes how software serves business needs. These systems autonomously handle tasks, make decisions and continuously learn from their environment to optimize outcomes. While current generative AI tools augment human capabilities, agentic AI actively drives outcomes through automated decisions and actions based on dynamic inputs and goals. Consider what this means for business operations. An agentic AI system can analyze sales data and actively pursue qualified leads. It can even engage prospects. It will anticipate bottlenecks in supply chains and automatically implement solutions before issues arise. It will also orchestrate entire marketing campaigns and adjust messaging and targeting as it learns what resonates with each audience segment. In addition to its advanced functionality, the technology is also transforming how innovation is sold. The traditional per-seat software model is evolving towards outcomes-based models that reward actual value creation, not usage. It\u2019s a radical departure that mirrors the very promise of agentic AI: technology that delivers results, not just features. Finally, for all the fear of AI being a job killer, the reality is more nuanced. Consider: According to The World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report 2025, the proportion of tasks completed by humans exclusively is expected to fall to 33% from 47% between 2025 and 2030 . However, the percentage completed by humans assisted by technology is expected to rise to 33% from 30% as businesses improve collaboration between their humans, machines and algorithms. We\u2019re creating unprecedented opportunities for teams to focus on what truly drives business value: strategy, relationships and innovation. Building The Agentic AI Future Which brings me back to \u201cboom.\u201d Booms can be messy, loud and disruptive. Agentic AI is prone to all of these. The rise of agentic AI\u2014AI systems capable of autonomous goal-setting, reasoning and action-taking\u2014faces several challenges that span technological, economic, ethical and practical concerns. These include the following. Agentic AI is tough to manage. Many AI \u201cagents,\u201d for example, struggle with context retention and fail to adapt in complex, open-ended environments. And, unlike traditional AI models, agentic systems are hard to measure since they don\u2019t just generate outputs but interact over time. Also, agentic AI systems don\u2019t always place nicely with legacy systems that are not built for autonomy, adaptability or spontaneity. AI agents can also develop and exhibit behaviors, discriminate unfairly or act in ways that are legally or ethically questionable. Cost is also a consideration. Agentic AI requires extensive training and investment. What is more, agentic AI requires human oversight, debugging and continuous fine-tuning to remain reliable. But the investment is worthwhile. Recently, the research and analyst firm Gartner said agentic AI \u201cwill autonomously resolve 80% of common customer service issues without human intervention by 2029.\u201d The savings that companies that deploy the technology will be immense. With these gains, the opportunity to invest in human capital will be staggering. That\u2019s a boom that should resonate with anyone who uses technology.

Seth Matlins is the Managing Director of the Forbes CMO Network. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 06:30am EDT Updated Apr 14, 2025, 11:59am EDT Share Save For The Entrepreneurial Chief Marketing Officer, Challenging Norms Is the New Norm. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Uncertainty Index, 6 weeks ago, measures of global uncertainty reached their third highest level since monthly tracking began in 2008 , behind only that year\u2019s global economic turmoil and the pandemic. And as any behavioral scientist\u2014or anyone with common sense for that matter\u2014knows, uncertainty clouds and complicates decision making processes and thus the path to purchase and is something other than the optimal macro-context for marketing or marketers. But so it is, and so it makes the need for chief marketers to challenge norms, thinking and doing entrepreneurially and differently, ever more important. What then makes for an entrepreneurial CMO? At Forbes , and as we have for the four years since we created this recognition, we consider the entrepreneurial CMO one who approaches driving growth neither beholden to the status quo nor to disrupting it for the sake of same. We believe the entrepreneurial CMO understands both what has enduring value and what needs to change, whether within their organizations and/or in how they go to market. They are strategic risk-takers, learning and optimizing based on both what works and, inevitably, what doesn\u2019t, believing that failures aren\u2019t failures if you learn from and get better because of them. They see opportunity in constraints and are relentlessly focused on making and doing more with less, no matter how much they might have. Their entrepreneurial approach to marketing challenges assumptions and what\u2019s come and been done before. It\u2019s a mindset that informs their strategies, and evidence of it is often seen through tactical application and activation, the in-market expression of mindset and approach. So too do we recognize the difference between being a great CMO and a great and entrepreneurial one. Not everyone is both and not everyone who is, is both at the same time. A great CMO focuses on what matters most, on what creates and captures demand, and on how to best allocate limited resources to unlimited opportunities. They eschew the rest as distraction and think about the business and their role in driving it strategically and then execute creatively. However, we consider this to be as fundamental as it is essential, and not in and of itself evidence of an entrepreneurial approach. We also recognize that the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d must be considered within the specific context of different industries, categories, companies, and markets. Because that which may be business as usual for company X might be an entirely new way of thinking and doing for company Y, and our judging and selection of the fifty CMOs recognized on this year\u2019s list makes efforts to account for this. It\u2019s our conviction that a status-quo approach to marketing is an increasingly challenged one. It\u2019s our belief that an entrepreneurial take on driving growth and on the art, science, and practice of marketing is and will be increasingly important to great\u2014even good\u2014CMOs, as there is no current reason to think these times of radical uncertainty will become anything but more so in the near-future. As reminder, this particular Forbes list is a one-and-done list, which is to say that once someone has appeared on it, they are no longer eligible for it. This year\u2019s cohort represents the most geographically diverse one yet, and as you read through it (presented alphabetically), you\u2019ll find evidence of an entrepreneurial marketing approach from leaders stewarding brands and companies across categories and the globe. Each is a chief marketer\u2014regardless of their titles\u2014who has been selected from among hundreds of nominees, based on open-nominations, and judged by qualitative consideration from amongst their peers, marketing industry and agency leaders, executive recruiters, CMO list alumni, and Forbes, by whom all final decisions were made. Regardless of what and where they market, it\u2019s how they market and compete that finds them recognized on this 4 th annual Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 list. As in year\u2019s past, we think you\u2019ll find something to learn from each and all of those recognized and invite you to get to know them below. 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 Additional writing and reporting by Laura Ratliffe. Some quotes have been lightly edited for clarity and/or brevity. A-C tk Benji Baer CMO, CBRE FOLLOW Because despite a fundamental, global reset for commercial real estate driven by economic uncertainty, office-norm disruptions, and the continued evolution towards a post-pandemic new normal, Baer\u2019s marketing embraces the disruption that comes from \u201cbreaking models.\u201d Knowing that the times and category require reinvention, Baer and her team have reimagined CBRE\u2019s brand and client experience, marketing\u2019s mission, structure, capabilities, and audiences, and, as she told Forbes , \u201cbuilt a level of accountability the business had not previously experienced.\u201d During her tenure as CMO of the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate services firm, Baer and her team have challenged outdated paradigms and models. At a time when businesses and policymakers are reevaluating how cities function, Baer and her team created the firm\u2019s Shaping Tomorrow\u2019s Cities initiative, positioning CBRE as more than a services provider by urging industry leaders to rethink economic, demographic, and infrastructure challenges. \u201c[Marketing] stepped up to be the ultimate convener, giving a voice\u2014and a platform\u2014to these consequential themes,\u201d Baer tells Forbes . Since its launch, this program alone has doubled the firm\u2019s client engagement. In Q4 2024, CBRE\u2019s reported revenues increased 16% year-over-year (YoY). Linda Bethea Linda Bethea CMO, Danone North America FOLLOW Because Bethea\u2019s focus on \u201cchampioning unorthodox ways of doing things\u201d ensures the company\u2019s marketing remains agile and continually \u201ctweaked\u201d based on performance. With the company since 2020, Bethea has found new ways to solve problems and meet unmet consumer needs with what she describes as a \u201ctest and learn\u201d approach. To these ends, Bethea and her team work to create a culture of learning and risk-taking, embracing what inevitable failures can teach, \u201ccurating a wall of \u2018fame & shame\u2019 highlighting both our successes and failures to help our team become more comfortable with risk-taking.\u201d Examples of Bethea\u2019s unorthodox and entrepreneurial approach include launching ST\u014dK, a \u201cbold\u201d cold-brew brand\u2014not just in partnership with Wrexham AFC but by \u201csponsoring a stadium in a country where the product isn\u2019t sold?\u201d As she asked Forbes , \u201cwhat is bolder than that?\u201d Facing budget declines of 70% for International Delight, a $1B+ portfolio brand, Bethea and her team took an insight\u201475% of 18-24-year-olds watch at least one hour of reality TV weekly\u2014and created a TikTok reality show, Cr\u00e9me House , to drive engagement and growth. In the last quarter reported, Danone saw an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.8% across its North American market. Benjamin Braun Benjamin Braun CMO, Samsung Europe FOLLOW Because Braun markets with the conviction that scale isn\u2019t incompatible with agility and that \u201ceven if you work for a massive global conglomerate like Samsung you operate as a start-up team.\u201d With a remit including oversight of the company\u2019s marketing across 44 countries, Braun tells Forbes that you can\u2019t \u201callow yourself to become complacent and slow. You think big and figure out how to deliver without a budget or people. Change,\u201d he says, \u201cis driven by people with ideas. Not budgets.\u201d For Braun, marketing isn\u2019t just about storytelling\u2014it\u2019s about proving real business results because, and as he says, \u201conly then will we gain credibility.\u201d Illustrations of this and his entrepreneurial approach are seen in the brand\u2019s activation at the Paris Olympics. Rather than spending millions on advertising, Braun and his team went guerrilla\u2014gifting 17,000 Samsung foldable phones to Olympians and Paralympians, requesting only that they unpack them on social media. This led to \u201cVictory Selfies\u201d on Olympic podiums, massive global exposure at a fraction of the cost, and a 23% sales increase. International online research data and analytics firm YouGov recently named Samsung the #1 Best Global Brand for 2025. Heidi Browning Heidi Browning Senior EVP and Chief Marketing Officer, National Hockey League FOLLOW Because as sports\u2019 traditional broadcast model evolves to a multi-platform and direct-to-consumer one, Browning markets knowing engaging the next generation of fans requires a transformation in skills and approach. Equating the entrepreneurial mindset driving the league\u2019s marketing to the \u201ccowboy ethos\u201d she learned growing up in Montana, Browning tells Forbes , this cowboy spirit creates the \u201cfearless pursuit of new frontiers, question(ing) everything; both why and why not; and being comfortable with the unknown.\u201d To ensure the NHL\u2019s continued growth, Browning and her team apply the lessons of start-up culture to invite new fans and revenues into the sport and league. Examples include creating the Power Players Youth Advisory Board, embedding Gen Z perspectives directly into marketing decisions to ensure future generation relevance, launching an original content docuseries, \u201c Face-Off: Inside the NHL,\u201d with Amazon Studios among others, and which succeeded in driving both upper and lower funnel growth metrics. The NHL saw record-breaking business performance in 2023-24, with revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year increase, and total attendance hitting an all-time high of 22.9 million. Jason Bunge Jason Bunge CMO, Hasbro FOLLOW Because when Bunge joined the 102-year-old toy category icon as its first CMO in 2023, \u201cthere was,\u201d as he told Forbes , \u201cthe opportunity and need to build an entirely new marketing organization; construct a new set of marketing capabilities to snap to the company\u2019s evolving business portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, redefine the role of marketing for the different needs of each business.\u201d The former Riot Games CMO and his team approach driving growth recognizing the challenges and opportunities for the company\u2019s principal business lines (toys, physical games and digital/video games) \u201care bespoke, and the marketing organization must be able to demonstrate agility, efficiency and scale in how it addresses each.\u201d To these ends, Bunge carved out 5% of their budget \u201cfor a first-of-its-kind company test-and-learn agenda,\u201d in order \u201cto inject a new mindset of \u2018roles of brands\u2019, (because) not everything was going to grow and not everything needed the same type or amount of marketing.\u201d This approach drove insights allowing Bunge and his team to understand where resources would have the greatest impact and return. As Bunge shared, \u201chaving an entrepreneurial mindset sometimes means breaking old habits and fighting hard to create space and oxygen for new approaches.\u201d Emma Chalwin Emma Chalwin CMO, Workday FOLLOW Because as she leads all marketing globally for this enterprise software company, Chalwin is intent on driving growth by \u201cbreaking the B2B mold.\u201d As Chalwin and her team disrupt Workday\u2019s traditional marketing and ensure it is anything but category-typical, she never loses sight of the fact that, as she told Forbes , \u201cwe\u2019re not just selling to a business; we\u2019re selling to the people who work there.\u201d This human-centric approach to enterprise marketing is driven by a mindset rooted in what she describes as rule-breaking, risk-taking and acting like \u201can entrepreneur inside a Fortune 500 company.\u201d Believing that challenging the status quo of B2B marketing requires a sense of humor and resolve, she and her team launched the Rock Star 2.0 campaign, bringing an \u201cunexpected irreverence\u201d that challenged conceptions about who the rock stars of business are. Chalwin tells Forbes the campaign increased web traffic by over 50% and lead-to-sales conversions by 17%. She\u2019s also working to train 20,000 employees as brand ambassadors to ensure everyone can share a consistent and compelling brand story. Workday\u2019s FY25 revenues increased 16.4% YoY. Kim Chappell Kim Chappell Chief Brand Officer, Bobbie FOLLOW Because in order to compete against industry Goliaths, Chappell is helping build this infant formula company into more than just a business and is reshaping conversations and expectations about modern parenting. For Chappell, being an entrepreneurial marketer isn\u2019t just a mindset\u2014it\u2019s a muscle. As she told Forbes , \u201cyou have to train yourself to move in the moment without hesitation\u2014with limited resources and often without a blueprint for success. If you don\u2019t go do the work, it\u2019s just another idea, what-if, or magic moment lost.\u201d One example of Chappell\u2019s approach to advancing the conversations driving Bobbie\u2019s growth, is when a Times Square billboard featuring culinary influencer Molly Baz, pregnant, in underwear, and holding lactation cookies over her breasts was removed for violating the billboard owner\u2019s guidelines, Chappell and her team saw opportunity and moved to both seize and make the moment. In only two weeks, Bobbie had Baz back on a Times Square billboard, this time breastfeeding her newborn\u2014a cultural first\u2014and apt illustration of Chappell\u2019s entrepreneurial conviction that \u201cnot everything needs a quarter of planning to be on brand, bold and successful.\u201d Chappell tells Forbes that over the past year, Bobbie has become the fastest-growing brand in its category. Daniel Cherry III Daniel Cherry III SVP & General Manager, adidas FOLLOW Because for Cherry, entrepreneurial marketing is about \u201calways being in beta, and instead of fearing failure embracing it as critical feedback pushing ideas one step closer to thrilling the consumer.\u201d As Cherry helped lead the brand through the very public early-end of its controversial partnership with Kanye West his perspective on failure as feedback would make the difference. \u201cWe suffered a crisis of confidence and almost believed the hype,\u201d he told Forbes . But rather than replacing the void left by the end of that partnership with another, Cherry thought and did differently, turning to adidas\u2019 greatest asset\u2014its archive\u2014and creating \u201cOriginals LA.\u201d Intended as a new business unit not just a marketing approach, Cherry\u2019s idea for moving the business forward looked backwards. By tapping the brand\u2019s archives, Cherry and his team helped put adidas back at the center of sneaker culture, as evidenced by the near ubiquity of Sambas and Gazelles over the past year. Cherry also built forward, championing new collaborations blending nostalgia with modernity, launching initiatives like the adidas Foundation, and restructuring creative workflows to give designers greater autonomy. For the quarter ending December 2024, company revenues had increased nearly 24% YoY. Kristyn Cook Kristyn Cook EVP and Chief Agency, Sales & Marketing Officer, State Farm FOLLOW Because in the crowded and complex insurance market, Cook leads marketing for this category leader with a conviction that it\u2019s only by \u201ctaking the right calculated risks where you have opportunity to win big.\u201d Importantly though, the work Cook leads proves entrepreneurial marketing doesn\u2019t always mean chasing reinvention for reinvention\u2019s sake, Cook and her team are amplifying State Farm\u2019s most powerful assets\u2014its signature red, iconic jingle, and, of course, Jake from State Farm\u2014by positioning them in high-profile, real-world moments that matter. \u201cOur goal is to stay nimble so we can jump in on trending cultural moments,\u201d Cook told Forbes . As examples, the brand has been a first-mover in the category in Gaming, and when Donna Kelce became a cultural focal point, State Farm took advantage of the moment by placing Jake next to her at a game, amplifying brand I.P. and creating a clutter-breaking moment for the brand. A 25-year company veteran, Cook oversees both marketing and sales. And in support of the 18,000 agents in its network, she and her team \u201calways strive to be \u2018market movers\u2019 in any space in which we play.\u201d Phil Cook Phil Cook CMO, WNBA FOLLOW Because during an explosion in interest from fans and partners alike, Cook, the league\u2019s first CMO, is ensuring the WNBA isn\u2019t just riding a wave of growth but actively driving it. Cook and his team are creating a new marketing playbook for the WNBA and its rising stars, during a time of unprecedented attention on women\u2019s basketball. While most leagues pay little attention to their players\u2019 pasts once drafted,Cook and his team took a different strategic approach with their \u201cWelcome to the W\u201d campaign, as college stars including Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink segued from the NCAA to the WNBA. In leading efforts to bridge the players\u2019 college and pro journeys, the campaign leaned heavily into the players\u2019 college pasts, creating a narrative continuity helping grow the league\u2019s fan-base on the players\u2019 existing ones. This, as well as a differentiated commitment to social impact, a heightened focus on dimensionalizing player narratives, and creating a 24/7 content hub for the league amongst other efforts, are driving unprecedented numbers for the WNBA. Last year witnessed the largest rights deal in the league\u2019s history, an aggregated $2.2B across ESPN, Amazon and NBCUniversal; sponsorship revenue and demand exploded, as attendance increased 48% and sellout games 242% YoY. Stefano Curti Stefano Curti Chief Brands Officer, Coty FOLLOW Because with a determination to \u201cmake a large company small again,\u201d Curti is ensuring leaner teams and faster decision-making help transform Coty into a nimbler player across the global beauty category. As the leader of a transformation that\u2019s revitalized brand icons like CoverGirl and Rimmel, Curti\u2019s entrepreneurial approach is rooted in speed and connection. In order to mirror the approach of smaller and niche-beauty players, and nurture the brands\u2019 internal \u201ccool factor,\u201d he and his team created an internal incubator, Agile Beauty, which operates like a startup within Coty. Since its inception, the incubator has developed trend-driven products in just eight months, an industry-best for a global beauty powerhouse.

Coty reported 10% net revenue growth in 2024, outpacing the 9% global beauty market increase. D-K Carmen DeRosas Carmen DeRosas EVP, Head of Marketing, Rakbank FOLLOW Because by challenging status quo and conventional industry norms, DeRosas is redefining what marketing is in the UAE\u2019s financial services category, and helping lead the transformation of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. Since arriving at Rakbank, DeRosas tells Forbes she has \u201cimplemented a culture of continuous experimentation\u2026that continues to challenge and improve our models,\u201d evidence of which can be seen in a near 60% reduction in agency costs and 50% increase in asset turnaround times during her tenure. Ensuring that marketing is a driver of the company\u2019s innovation and transformation, has DeRosas and her team embracing a challenger brand ethos and shifting mindsets \u201cfrom fear to exploration,\u201d which she credits with helping drive \u201cthe step change we have created across all marketing disciplines, from transforming the way we show up, reshaping agency partnerships, launching campaigns that have elevated brand perception and performance, to delivering a 4x uplift in digital acquisition.\u201d With industry expertise honed during time at PayPal and American Express, DeRosas\u2019s remit includes overseeing the Rakbank brand, its insurance technology platform Protego, and family finance app Skiply. Since getting to Rakbank, DeRosas and her team have driven a major shift in marketing\u2019s role at the bank\u2014and their enhanced brand focus has contributed to a 13-point increase in employee engagement, reinforcing her belief that a strong, people-first culture is key to sustained innovation and growth. Rakbank had record-breaking financial performance last year, and a 16.4% increase in net profits YoY. Carole Diarra Carole Diarra Global Vice President of Marketing, UGG FOLLOW Because the \u201cvision to see beyond traditional strategies and the agility to act on them in ways that drive real impact\u201d is helping Diarra fuel the iconic brand\u2019s transformation from its comfort-first origins to a broader fashion and lifestyle business. With a global remit, Diara and her team are redefining what UGG is, where it shows up, and how it connects with its audience. Under her marketing leadership, they\u2019re doing this by focusing on a combination of \u201cagile media thinking\u201d that is inverting status-quo channel approaches, a media-mix strategy shift to social-first, real-time creative decision making, and liberating their marketing from the category\u2019s traditional seasonal emphasis. An illustration of the latter and Diarra\u2019s enhanced emphasis on consumer-led innovation is the brand\u2019s \u201cUGG Season\u201d platform which, as Diarra shared with Forbes , \u201cdidn\u2019t start from us but from our community (including Cardi B)...we didn\u2019t create the movement; we recognized and amplified it, letting culture lead our strategy.\u201d This entrepreneurial approach, one untethered to the past, is also evident in UGG\u2019s unexpected collaborations with Paris Fashion Week, and fashion-forward brands including Sacai and Telfar. A core part of the Deckers\u2019 portfolio, for Q3FY25, the UGG brand reported +16.1% increase in net sales YoY. Cristina Diezhandino Cristina Diezhandino CMO, Diageo FOLLOW Because Diezhandino\u2019s marketing for Diageo\u2019s 200 brands is rooted in a \u201cmindset of possibility\u201d and an approach that she told Forbes , values \u201dprogress over perfection. It\u2019s okay to fail as long as we learn.\u201d Despite category headwinds created by a changing world and consumer attitudes and behaviors, Diezhandino realizes that what doesn\u2019t change is the need to stay \u201ccentered around celebrations, culture and memorable moments\u201d and that this in turn requires her marketing organization to \u201cunderstand\u2014and shape the future of\u2014socializing better than anyone else.\u201d To these ends, Diezhandino and her team have built a marketing organization thriving on \u201cconnected decisioning,\u201d curiosity, agility, experimentation, reorganizing marketing into \u201cagile brand communities\u201d which allows them to better turn insight into action. To accelerate the growth of $100+ (USD) brands, Diezhandino created the Diageo Luxury Group, uniting its luxury portfolio. To ensure her organization has the tools to act fast in evolving markets, Diezhandino spearheaded initiatives including a Virtual Studio \u201crevolutionizing how we create content\u201d, a global partnerships lab, and Diageo\u2019s largest consumer data initiative. With responsibility for marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the global portfolio, Diezhandino is thinking and doing differently to ensure Diageo\u2019s place in socializing\u2019s future. Brian Donnelly Brian Donnelly EVP, GM and Chief Commercial Officer, Ancestry FOLLOW Because Donnelly understands that \u201cspeed is a competitive advantage\u201d and, as he tells Forbes , while \u201cthere\u2019s a comfort in the \u2018tried and true,\u2019 challenging norms, experimenting fearlessly, and pivoting quickly, allows us to adapt and refine strategies in real-time.\u201d With P&L accountability for the 40-year-old genealogy brand\u2019s global business operations, Donnelly\u2019s remit includes oversight of marketing, growth, and business development across the 130 countries where they do business. Intent on \u201cinspiring a culture of innovation across the business\u201d Donnelly and his team identified a growth opportunity, creating a new market by leveraging their genetic testing expertise and applying it to the pet category for the first time. Focused on driving growth by marketing and raising awareness \u201cof the emotional, cultural and personal benefits that come from discovering your roots,\u201d Donnelly and his team are pushing boundaries and experimenting with the new as they reshape Ancestry\u2019s brand, commerce, and customer engagement. Donnelly reports that brand health metrics are rising and that, in 2024, the company saw double-digit growth in DNA kit sales. As of May 1, Donnelly will become the Chief Commercial Officer at Myriad Genetics. Bene\u0301 Eaton Ben\u00e9 Eaton CMO, Figs FOLLOW Because in leading marketing globally for this DTC healthcare brand, Eaton\u2019s entrepreneurial approach balances boldness and precision, and as she told Forbes , \u201cisn\u2019t just about disrupting\u2014but about building something meaningful and enduring.\u201d With a remit spanning 34 countries, Eaton and her team lean into the company\u2019s entrepreneurial DNA to fuel their own. For Eaton, entrepreneurial marketing \u201cisn\u2019t just about growth (but) about redefining how a brand can impact people, culture and the world.\u201d To these ends, and as one example, Eaton and her team led Figs to become Team USA\u2019s official Medical Team Outfitter, creating a global stage and moment celebrating the community in a never-been-done-before way. She says the effort drove \u201csignificant incremental revenue...but more than the numbers, this campaign redefined how healthcare professionals are perceived.\u201d The LA fires, which devastated the company\u2019s hometown, provide further illustration as Eaton and her team mobilized to quickly support over 1,500 displaced healthcare professionals. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a crisis response\u2014but testament to our entrepreneurial mindset: acting with urgency, empathy, and impact to show up for our community in moments that matter most.\u201d Colin Fleming Colin Fleming CMO, ServiceNow FOLLOW Because with a \u201cstubborn intolerance of mediocrity,\u201d Fleming focuses, as he tells Forbes on \u201cwhat could be, and refusing to be discouraged by the status quo.\u201d Insistent that \u201cnone of the Bs in \u2018B2B\u2019 should stand for boring,\u201d Fleming and his team are proving that bold storytelling, culture-shaping campaigns, and a strong point of view will drive growth regardless of sector. With a remit leading ServiceNow\u2019s end-to-end global marketing, planning and operations, Fleming has evolved company strategy from product-led to brand-led. As he and his team seek \u201cexponential thinking and big, bold ideas that break the mold,\u201d they\u2019ve rolled out the company\u2019s most comprehensive global campaign ever, high-profile and perception shifting partnerships, and \u201cProject Marie Kondo,\u201d which led to cutting 50% of their content creation to ensure focus on what \u201csparks joy\u201d for customers. \u201cThis simplification\u201d he told us, \u201cfrees our teams to concentrate on impact and alignment rather than volume.\u201d For the 12 months ending as of the date of this writing, Service Now\u2019s market capitalization was up 22%. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in ServiceNow.) Adrian Fung Adrian Fung Global CMO, eBay FOLLOW Because Fung brings a \u201cfounder\u2019s mentality\u201d to the iconic ecommerce brand, focusing, as he told Forbes , on \u201ctreating every dollar like it\u2019s your own, and finding scrappy ways to leverage existing assets, customers, partners.\u201d For Fung, a global remit for marketing a brand and multi-category business like eBay\u2019s, with some 130 million customers and over 2.1 billion listings, requires an approach he defines as \u201clearning fast rather than failing fast.\u201d And in order to leverage learnings to drive innovation at scale, Fung recognizes the need \u201cto balance speed and agility with the complexity and scale of eBay\u2019s (business). To do this, we identify small but high leverage opportunities that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to optimize impact.\u201d One example: An initially small-scale test with Facebook Marketplace in Germany which enabled buyers to browse eBay listings directly on Marketplace, rolled out internationally. Recognizing \u201cthis type of innovation can\u2019t be achieved from marketing alone - and requires an end-to-end approach\u201d finds Fung breaking down silos and challenging how problems are solved across the business. As of this writing, eBay\u2019s stock was up over 58% YoY. Arielle Gross Samuels Arielle Gross Samuels Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, General Catalyst FOLLOW Because with a global mandate across all marketing and communications, the former Blackstone CMO and 10-year Meta veteran, is looking to help redefine the company\u2019s place in its category and is \u201cbuilding from zero to one.\u201d In a category-atypical approach, Gross Samuels is using what she tells Forbes is \u201csurround-sound, cross-channel storytelling as a strategic commercial lever.\u201d To help lead the brand beyond its venture capital origins to that of a global investment and transformation company, Samuels and her team launched \u201c Venture Beyond \u201d, not just a campaign but an invitation to their ecosystem of founders, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. She credits the launch with \u201cinvigorating our ecosystem and expanding what\u2019s possible. \u201c For the year ahead, among other things, Gross Samuels and her team are focused on \u201cunveiling new strategic brand partnerships with major platforms, revitalizing our social strategy with franchised branded series, and convening first-of-their-kind forums to catalyze our community\u2014all in service to ecosystem transformation.\u201d By ensuring \u201cwe play our own game and operate as a category of one,\u201d Gross Samuels and her team are continuing to help redefine what people know of and expect from General Catalyst. Gail Horwood Gail Horwood Chief Marketing & Customer Experience Officer, Novartis FOLLOW Because Horwood doesn\u2019t see constraint in the pharmaceutical category\u2019s deeply regulated environment but a catalyst for integrating \u201cnow and next practices\u201d redefining how the company markets to drive impact. To better connect with their multiple constituencies, Horwood and her team have championed and facilitated the \u201ccreative and innovative;\u201d building Novartis\u2019 Innovation and Content Labs, and establishing its Media Center of Excellence, leading them to explore non-traditional category channels and audiences. They\u2019ve turned to gaming as a way to educate healthcare professionals and \u201cset new standards for audience engagement in the pharma industry.\u201d And while in many categories a Super Bowl ad is no proof of the entrepreneurial, in January, Horwood and her team broke company and category conventions with a campaign to raise awareness and drive screenings for breast cancer. The ad\u2019s creative was bold by any measure, especially within the context of pharma, and is a case study proving that any category\u2019s work can be emotionally resonant. As Horwood told Forbes , \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to just show up; we wanted people to receive the message and take action.\u201d A subsequent announcement of a broader partnership with the NFL \u201cmerges the power of sports, culture, and health advocacy in a way that has never been done before.\u201d As of their Q4 reporting, Novartis\u2019s stock was up over 15% YoY. Charisse Hughes Charisse Hughes Chief Growth Officer, Kellanova FOLLOW Because Hughes is proving that legacy CPG brands can lead cultural conversations\u2014and drive growth while doing it. Since joining Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), Hughes has transformed the company\u2019s marketing approach, leaning into bold, unconventional collaborations and innovations that extend beyond the company\u2019s broad portfolio of household names, including Kellogg\u2019s Pringles, and Cheez-Its, themselves. As Hughes told Forbes , \u201cin an era where traditional marketing strategies aren't enough, we have embraced unconventional, culturally resonant collaborations that push boundaries...(and) elevate our brands beyond transactional products to cultural icons.\u201d To these ends, one example of the work Hughes and her team have done is the collaboration between Crocs and Pringles, which went beyond a mere licensing deal in order to create mutually inspired products for both brands. This included the insta-worthy Pringles-inspired slides and the Crush Boot which sold out in under two hours, driving earned media in publications like GQ, not typically known for paying attention to pantry brands. In August, Mars, Inc. offered to acquire Kellanova for $36 billion. If it closes, this will be the largest CPG deal in over a decade. As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up over 51% YoY. Kerttu Inkeroinen Kerttu Inkeroinen Marketing and E-commerce Director, Lucky Saint FOLLOW Because Inkeroinen leads marketing for this six-year-old UK-based alcohol-free beer brand with a \u201cBreak Rules, Honor Traditions\u201d mantra, which she says, \u201callows us to challenge category norms while respecting beer culture.\u201d Despite having only a fraction of the marketing budget of her multinational competitors, Inkeroinen \u201capproaches every decision with big budget energy,\u201d telling Forbes she \u201csees opportunities where others see limitations and with the resilience\u2014what we call sisu in Finnish\u2014to push through.\u201d And while some may consider process and entrepreneurial agility to be opposed, Inkeroinen doesn\u2019t considering \u201ca well-structured framework what enables fast, efficient scaling.\u201d To these ends, she and her team introduced a cross-functional \u201cgate process\u201d to ensure rapid execution without quality compromises, and built a proprietary digital platform to, among other things, drive pint giveaways in pubs, an in-house innovation that she credits with \u201cremoving cost barriers and unlocking new distribution opportunities.\u201d Inkeroinen leads marketing, communications, innovation, and e-commerce for the brand across the U.K., and as it expands into Ireland and the Netherlands. Her entrepreneurial approach has helped Lucky Saint become what she says is the most loved and most Googled alcohol-free beer in the U.K. Marissa Jarrett Marissa Jarratt EVP, Chief Marketing & Sustainability Officer, 7-Eleven FOLLOW Because for Jarratt \u201cacting like an entrepreneur is a cornerstone of how I lead and inspire my team,\u201d an approach driving how she has built the marketing organization for this global retail giant. Focused on ensuring 7-Eleven doesn\u2019t just keep pace with cultural and consumer shifts but actively drives them while navigating market volatility and new resource constraints, Jarratt emphasizes agility, creativity, and resilience. With broad responsibilities in the U.S. and Canada across marketing, corporate communications, and sustainability, Jarratt and her teams navigated \u201cover 220 reputation-critical issues, implementing a three-tier crisis management strategy,\u201d introduced \u201cBig Bite Hot Dog-Flavored Sparkling Water\u201d on April Fool\u2019s Day to recruit Gen Z customers and publicize the launch of their private label sparkling water brand. The creatively dissonant effort drove a nearly 10% month-over-month increase in store brand sales and a 12% increase across the category; expanded 7-Eleven\u2019s in-house creative agency, producing campaigns faster and cheaper, all while also reducing plastic bag usage by 37%. Jarratt is intent on \u201csteering the brand out of a challenging 2024\u201d and will continue enhancing the retailer\u2019s \u201cability to adapt and innovate, even in a resource-constrained environment. Nicolas Kettelhake Nicolas Kettelhake CMO, Polaroid FOLLOW Because in a digital world saturated with \u201cperfect\u201d images, Kettelhake is reinvigorating an 80-year-old analog brand, making what\u2019s old new again by proving that imperfection sells. Kettelhake and his team market by counterprogramming and leaning away from\u2014rather than into\u2014digital cultural trends. Because Polaroid images can\u2019t be retouched, Kettelhake and his team have delivered what he described to Forbes as \u201ca counter to digitized, altered, \u2018perfect\u2019 photography, because Polaroid is one of one, and inherently imperfect due to the chemical development process.\u201d Kettelhake ensures the brand\u2019s claim to a positioning rooted in the tactile and imperfect not only drives communication but product innovation. To make a statement against the endlessly replicable nature of digital images, he and his team have elevated the craft of instant photography by appealing to high-end professional photographers, invited digitally-native consumers into the brand by becoming part of sub-cultures, and created a new membership program. By zigging while culture zags, Kettelhake\u2019s integrated, multi-channel and cohort approach has sold-out both new products and film, and driven YoY double digit sell-through increase across the full business. Kettelhake left Polaroid as of April 1st. L-N Drieke Leenknegt Drieke Leenknegt CMO, Vans FOLLOW Because Leenknegt understands that in the ever-changing consumer landscape, today\u2019s \u201cmarketing isn\u2019t about incremental change\u2014it\u2019s about transformation.\u201d Despite its globally iconic brand status, Leenknegt inherited a business facing years of declining revenue and a turnaround imperative. Her entrepreneurial approach to marketing has helped reverse Vans\u2019 decline and position it for long-term growth. Since joining two years ago, Leenknegt has restructured the company\u2019s global marketing team, going beyond necessary surface-level adjustments to deep, strategic reinvention that is connecting dots across marketing, product, and commerce. All of this is driving what she tells Forbes is \u201cagility, alignment, and profitability, ensuring innovation is more than just an idea.\u201d Leenknegt and her team are embracing and deploying an \u201calways on marketing model...that balances reinvention with authenticity.\u201d Illustration is found in their creation and launch of a new pinnacle segment, OTW by Vans , at Paris Fashion Week. Describing this as both a product and cultural innovation, Leenknegt credits the innovation with fueling extraordinary sell-through and, as being but one effort that is helping restore brand momentum. While numbers for the VF Corp-owned brand are off the record, Leenknegt reports a return to growth and that brand and business have turned around. Diego Lomanto Diego Lomanto CMO, Writer FOLLOW Because without the tens of billions of dollars raised by competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lomanto leads marketing for this startup generative AI enterprise solution, certain that \u201cwinning in AI isn\u2019t just about who builds the best model, but about who owns the conversation.\u201d Given their relative resource constraints, Lomanto and his team approach owning the conversation by ensuring Writer is, as he told Forbes , \u201cimpossible to ignore to the folks we wanted to have a conversation with...that wherever AI decision-makers looked, they saw Writer, setting us apart in a highly competitive, scrutinizing and often hesitant market.\u201d The brand\u2019s outsized presence on stage, in headlines, and on billboards along Silicon Valley\u2019s busiest highways was just one part of its scrappy reach and frequency strategy. Certain that \u201cthe entrepreneurial marketer knows the best marketing comes from customers who can\u2019t stop talking about their ROI,\u201d Lomanto created a program targeting analysts, a.k.a. the influencers of the AI category, marketing the brand as an ROI catalyst and movement, turning \u201cour biggest successes\u2014for companies like Salesforce and Uber\u2014into our biggest marketing assets.\u201d At the end of 2024, the company raised an additional $200 million, increasing its valuation to $1.9 billion. Victoria Lozano Victoria Lozano EVP and CMO, Crayola FOLLOW Because despite Crayola\u2019s dominant market share, Lozano pushes the business to think and market like a challenger, redefining not just what Crayola sells, but repositioning the brand and business by repositioning creativity itself. To Lozano and her team have redefined how the company creates commercial value. As Lozano told Forbes, \u201cCrayola is a bigger brand than business,\u201d and in order to capitalize on the former and overcome the latter, she and her team are shifting long-held but limiting parental perceptions about Crayola as just an arts-and-crafts brand by marketing \u201cbeyond the crayon,\u201d embedding the brand deeper into family routines and educational systems. To these ends, Lozano launched Campaign for Creativity , an advocacy movement reframing creativity\u2014and Crayola\u2019s role in it\u2014as a critical life skill; and built Crayola Studios, a content development and production division that creates programming across genres for kids and their parents. The studio already has some dozen partnerships, including those with parent company Hallmark, a BBC Kids partnership, and a brand partnership with audiobook platform Audible. Lozano\u2019s entrepreneurial approach is reframing the brand, its scope, and creating new sources of revenue. Martina Luger Martina Luger Chief Brand & Culture Officer, Ennismore FOLLOW Because as Luger leads marketing for this, U.K. based hospitality enterprise, she\u2019s rejecting the category\u2019s traditional price-based segmentation, and instead deploying a narrative-driven model to position and differentiate the company\u2019s brands. With a portfolio including The Mondrian, Hoxton and SLS brands, Luger and her team focus on disruptive lifestyle strategies rooted in her conviction that safe ground never leads to innovation. As she told Forbes , the entrepreneurial marketer has to have \u201cthe courage to stand on the edge of a cliff because only at the edge do you get the most amazing views.\u201d Luger and her team are \u201cmaking the statement that our hotels are more than just transactional decisions,\u201d an approach further illustrated by Ennismore\u2019s \u201cgame-changing\u201d loyalty program, \u201cDis-loyalty.\u201d Luger shared that while \u201ctraditional loyalty models reward people for sticking to the familiar\u2014we wanted to flip that idea on its head,\u201d and with no points, tiers, or blackout dates, members get 20% off first-time stays, and 10% off return visits, part of what\u2019s driving growth across her global remit for marketing 17 brands, and over 170 hotels in more than 35 countries with another 120+ in the pipeline. Astha Malik Astha Malik Chief Business and Marketing Officer, Braze FOLLOW Because certain \u201cthere has never been a better time to be a better marketer,\u201d Malik is unconstrained by the tried and true and untethered to industry standards and expectations. With a broad remit across this SaaS platform\u2019s corporate strategy, global expansion, and growth initiatives redefining how brands connect with their audiences\u2014and how Braze connects with its, Malik encourages innovation, as she told Forbes , by ensuring her teams are \u201ccomfortable with failure\u2014because it\u2019s not final.\u201d Malik and her team created the company\u2019s Innovation Lab, 427\u00b0, a consulting initiative providing clients agency like services during and post-sales in order to help them rethink customer connections at scale to provide clients, because Malik believes \u201cthe best marketing doesn\u2019t just drive pipeline, it builds enduring and valuable relationships. The Lab, but one illustration of her entrepreneurial approach in action, has \u201caccelerated sales cycles, improved satisfaction, and set us apart.\u201d Malik remains intent on challenging assumptions about the CMO role, ensuring marketing always has a seat at the Board table, and \u201cchallenging everyday actions and standing out when others may prefer to just fit in.\u201d For Q4 25, the company reported YoY revenue growth of 22%. Devika Mathrani Devika Mathrani Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, New York-Presbyterian FOLLOW Because in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape, Mathrani is \u201cshaping the future of health care and changing the conversation in the category\u201d for one of the nation\u2019s top 10 healthcare systems, by bringing unconventional strategies to a category not known for same. Mathrani and her team are challenged not just by their competitive set but also a glut of healthcare disinformation. When \u201calongside the rise of (public health) misinformation, we recognized the need to inform and empower consumers\u201d, as Mathrani told Forbes , they launched a newsroom operation to \u201cpublish trusted information\u2014helping people navigate their health proactively and reactively.\u201d When New York City faced a critical blood-supply shortage, Mathrani and her team drove essential donations by turning donations into a limited-edition product drop, applying a scarcity marketing model common in footwear but not in healthcare. Partnering with renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, donating blood became the only way to get Ansel\u2019s \u201c3 Lives Bar.\u201d Thinking and acting outside category norms led to a 25,000 percent (not a typo) increase in traffic to the donation site, and a 40% increase in donations. Stephanie McCarty Stephanie McCarty Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Taylor Morrison FOLLOW Because McCarty is challenging home-building category norms, transforming a traditionally rigid and slow-moving process in order to fundamentally reshape how buyers navigate one of the most significant purchases of their lives. With oversight of marketing for one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, McCarty told Forbes she is intent \u201cnot just on adapting to change but driving it, ensuring our marketing plays a critical role in our growth and shaping the future of the industry.\u201d McCarty and her team have led the company to create a fully-digital shopping experience, an \u201cunheard of\u201d first for the homebuilding category. As she told Forbes , this consumer-centric innovation drove meaningfully higher conversion rates, exponentially reduced cancellations, and increased revenue. McCarty, whose remit includes overseeing marketing and consumer engagement across 21 markets, has also redefined how homebuilders connect with consumers, turning social media from a branding tool into a direct revenue driver, another category first. Despite an environment marked by significantly higher interest rates, as of this writing, the company\u2019s stock was up over 7% YoY. Sarah Moore Sarah Moore CMO, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store FOLLOW Because as Moore leads marketing for the culturally iconic restaurant chain, she does so with the conviction that entrepreneurial marketing \u201cis not just the high-stakes journey of a disruptive startup\u2014but about leading transformation when the odds are against you\u2014when competition is fierce, behaviors are shifting, and a brand must evolve or fade.\u201d With oversight of all marketing for the chain\u2019s 660+ locations, including brand, culinary menu architecture, and pricing strategy, Moore and her team are driven by \u201cbucking category norms...and the relentless pursuit of discomfort.\u201d A s rising egg prices became their own source of discomfort for customers nationally, Moore told Forbes that she and her team flipped the competitive script and, \u201cinstead of raising prices (like competitors), we launched a rewards promotion where members earned extra for egg-based dishes.\u201d She credits the simple and counter-intuitive move with driving higher guest frequency and spend and adding 6 million new loyalty program members in just year one. Modernizing a brand that is literally rooted in the \u201cold\u201d is no small challenge. But Moore\u2019s take on being an entrepreneurial CMO \u201cisn\u2019t just about building something new. It\u2019s also about reinventing, reimaging, and revitalizing something that already exists.\u201d Michael Moses Michael Moses CMO, Universal Pictures Because in a landscape where \u201call the content in the world is the push of a button away,\u201d Moses markets acutely aware that \u201claunching every film is akin to launching a new business...every few weeks.\u201d Over the past year ,Moses, who has been with Universal for 25 years, seven as global CMO, oversaw marketing for a portfolio including Wicked and The Fall Guy, and as he told Forbes, always with a \u201chealthily skeptical eye on data because its proliferation is an alluring siren call that risks narrowcasting the audience and making all our approaches homogenized.\u201d For \u201cTwisters \u201d, overcoming this siren call meant tapping into an overlooked Heartland audience through country music partnerships and broadening the film\u2019s appeal without alienating traditional moviegoers. For \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d, Moses and his team took a slow-burn strategy\u2014festival screenings, a dialogue-free trailer\u2014helping make it 2024\u2019s top original animated title and making \u201c Wicked \u201d a ubiquitous cultural presence. In 2024, Universal led the domestic box office, surpassing $1.9 billion in ticket sales and securing four of the year\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films. P-Z Nicole Parlapiano Nicole Parlapiano CMO, Tubi FOLLOW Because in leading marketing globally for this FOX owned ad-supported streamer, Parlapiano is \u201cstripping fear from the equation and leaning into risk (to) drive business growth.\u201d As Parlapiano sees it, marketing today requires not just doing differently but thinking dangerously. With this in mind, as she told Forbes , she looks to identify \u201cmarketers who have dangerous ideas,\u201d and that while she has \u201cdone work that could fail, it\u2019s better to throw your hat in the ring than to wait for perfection.\u201d Along with a broad remit to grow Tubi\u2019s brand and audience, Parlapiano works closely with the streamer\u2019s B2B team in order to demonstrate how valuable Tubi\u2019s viewers are to advertisers. To these ends, her creatively dissonant \u201c Tubi Is More Popular Than\u201d campaign did just this, reframing both brand and business. Also, Parlapiano and her team launched Stubios , a \u201cfirst-to-market product\u201d for aspiring filmmakers and their fans, that gives the camera to \u201canyone who has a story and puts the power to greenlight in the hands of the viewer.\u201d The first class of Stubio projects goes live later this year. Over the past year, Tubi has seen monthly-average-user growth of 23% YoY. Lynn Pina Lynn Pina CMO, GeoBlue FOLLOW Because Pina drives marketing for this travel medical insurance brand with what she describes as an \u201cowner\u2019s mindset.\u201d As she told Forbes , \u201cwhen you see yourself as an employee only, you can be passive, complacent, and easily defeated. With an owner\u2019s mindset, I\u2019m relentless about finding solutions and creative approaches to achieve the desired outcome.\u201d For Pina, whose remit includes Marketing, Product and Customer Experience, driving growth with entrepreneurial marketing approach is about \u201cstriking the right balance between building and breaking,\u201d a perspective that has served Pina and the company well, in the highly regulated category, and over the past year in particular. In just six months\u2014rather than the usual 18-24\u2014Pina and her team led the creation and launch of a new product and partnership, Globaline , which significantly expanded the GeoBlue\u2019s portfolio and market reach. Doing so required Pina and her team to challenge assumptions, break down barriers, and build from scratch, all while working across two companies with two different cultures and competing priorities. Pina reports that the product launch reached 80% of its first-year goal within just six months. Surhabi Pokhyrial Surabhi Pokhriyal EVP, Chief Digital Growth Officer, Church & Dwight FOLLOW Because as digital has become 70% of the 186-year-old CPG company\u2019s media mix, Pokhriyal works to \u201cscale fast and scrap fast\u201d in a landscape where \u201cmany new shiny things come and fizzle often.\u201d For brands including household names like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and Waterpic, Pokhriyal tells Forbes that, over the past year, she and her teams have \u201cstarted using social as the \u2018third shelf\u2019 and have partnered with some 4000 influencers in order to create \u201ca virtuous cycle for social engagement drives online and in-store sales.\u201d This, along with ensuring \u201c\u2019no-dead-end media\u2019 and that over 90% of our media is shoppable, is how our teams truly scale fast and scrap fast when needed.\u201d Knowing that today\u2019s status quo can be disrupted in an instant, she and her team \u201ckeep raising the bar with readiness not just for the here and now, but for tomorrow.\u201d Pokhriyal credits this approach\u2014and a \u201chealthy sense of paranoia\u201d\u2014with helping \u201cdrive outsized eCommerce growth versus CPG peers.\u201d In the last year, Church & Dwight\u2019s revenue growth surpassed its outlook and, according to sources, outperformed its competitors. Amanda Rubin Amanda Rubin CMO, Citadel FOLLOW Because since joining the world\u2019s most profitable hedge-fund, Rubin is redefining what marketing means and does in a firm and industry that has long operated behind closed doors. As Rubin told Forbes , entrepreneurial marketing \u201crequires not only showing others what needs to be done, but more importantly, what else is possible even when it deviates from the status quo.\u201d Until Rubin, Citadel\u2019s marketing status quo relied largely on earned media-driven awareness of the firm\u2019s financial acumen, with little time given to its brand or that of its founder, Ken Griffin\u2019s. Facing \u201ca fierce war for talent and very public scrutiny\u201d, Rubin built Citadel\u2019s marketing function from the ground up to better position the company\u2014and Griffin\u2019s philanthropic efforts\u2014among what she describes as a \u201ccomplex ecosystem of audiences, from talent to commercial clients, regulators and policy-makers...none of their journeys are linear, and their perceptions have enduring impact on our commercial success.\u201d By actively building a marketing narrative, making visible what had historically been opaque, and deploying a multi-faceted content strategy across dozens of new touchpoints and channels, Rubin and her team have helped drive a 50% YoY increase in talent applications, while concurrently tripling awareness of Griffin\u2019s philanthropic initiatives. 1x1_John Schoolcraft John Schoolcraft Chief Creative Officer, Oatly FOLLOW Because Schoolcraft conceived and built a new-model approach to creating a category and driving growth for this oat-milk brand and company. Schoolcraft takes pains to make clear he is not a CMO and that Oatly doesn\u2019t have a marketing department \u201cat all\u201d but a creative one, something he made a stipulation for joining the company in 2012. As he told Forbes , he believes \u201cmarketing departments are filters, and it is always better to work with makers and problem solvers and not approvers.\u201d This perspective led Schoolcraft to build the \u201cOatly Department of Mind Control\u201d (ODMC), which he describes as a team of creative problem solvers,\u201d instead of a traditional marketing organization. \u201cThe ODMC doesn\u2019t solve isolated marketing or brand problems, we understand everything is tied together, so look to solve business problems...(sitting) in on meetings from innovation to finance gives the creative department ownership and understanding of the business, which turns all of us into entrepreneurs.\u201d While one might argue with his definitions, Schoolcraft\u2019s approach is working. Despite slowing growth in the plant-based food category globally, 12+ years in, Oatly continues seeing double-digit sales increases YoY. Alex Schultz Alex Schultz VP Analytics and CMO, Meta FOLLOW Because with an unusually broad remit for a CMO, including global oversight of all analytics and business, public affairs, brand and direct response consumer marketing across Meta and its brand portfolio, the analytically-driven Schultz marries the quantitative and qualitative helping disrupt and reinvent how the company drives business outcomes. While WhatsApp is dominant outside the U.S., in the U.S., it remains a challenger brand. Recognizing that the biggest brand-unlock for the messaging app would be product\u2014not marketing\u2014driven initially, Schultz and his team \u201cdeployed product changes to make sharing to WhatsApp easier\u201d before launching the brand\u2019s largest US campaign to date. This effort, \u201cdirect response ads using our platforms and others...(which) bent the curve on topline growth.\u201d Identifying an internal lag-time stifling growth of the company\u2019s burgeoning live-shopping ad business, where customers wanted to boost ad-spends but the internal ad-review period \u201cmeant the live video would be over by the time we approved the ads,\u201d Schultz and his team brought the idea and insight needed to help the product team reimagine the review process, and leading to what he tells Forbes is \u201cexplosive growth of live shopping with business messaging.\u201d At the end of 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 21.94% YoY. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in Meta.) Geoff Seeley Geoff Seeley CMO, PayPal FOLLOW Because as PayPal\u2019s business evolves, Seeley is helping drive \u201ca new approach to product-led marketing that spins our consumer and merchant flywheel even faster.\u201d Seeley\u2019s role as marketing leader is to help conceive and realize new product innovation, and take these products to market across their 450 million customers, 35 million merchants, 200 markets, B2B and B2C, and family of brands, including its eponymous one, Venmo and Honey, In his first year since joining as Global CMO, Seeley drove what he describes as \u201cone of the most significant strategic and executional transformations in our history.\u201d Focused on, as he told Forbes , \u201crevolutionizing global commerce again\u201d Seeley and his team are \u201cworking back from (our) customers to create the next innovations.\u201d Evidence of this and Seeley\u2019s intent to catalyze growth by changing how people think about and use the company\u2019s products is seen in the launch of PayPal\u2019s largest-ever program, \u201cEverywhere,\u201d and its partnership with, among others, Apple Wallet, and in how he and his team are capitalizing on Venmo\u2019s becoming a verb, and \u201csubvert(ing) that soundbite to introduce people to a much wider world of Venmo.\u201d As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up more than 18% YoY. Peter Semple Peter Semple CMO, Depop FOLLOW Because Semple \u201cthinks of our brand, our experience and our proposition as \u2018Always WIP\u2019...obsessing about the context in which we operate and reflecting on how we might react. Our conviction to act is the entrepreneurial mindset in action.\u201d With a remit for the Etsy-owned marketplace that includes oversight for brand marketing and communications, merchandising, media, seller growth, and an in-house creative studio, Semple tells Forbes he is \u201cconsistently iterating on the brand we present to the world, and the combination of channels and messages we leverage to bring that brand into peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d Focused on audience expansion, brand differentiation, and market share growth in the U.S. and Australia, Semple and his team are unafraid to broaden the brand\u2019s platform and appeal beyond their traditional core demographic. Illustrations of their entrepreneurial approach in action includes expanding Depop\u2019s advocacy programs across 100 U.S. college campuses, cultivating a new generation of engaged brand ambassadors and, also in the US, removing seller fees in order to further differentiate the brand and business, lowering barriers to entry, and leading to material YoY market share growth. In March, Semple was named interim CEO of the company. Jinal Shah Jinal Shah Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, Zip FOLLOW Because Shah is driving growth for the buy-now-pay-later platform, by \u201cchallenging assumptions, moving with urgency, and transforming constraints into advantages.\u201d Having led the company through multiple strategic evolutions since joining in 2021, Shah and her team are now stewarding Zip through what she describes as its hyper-growth phase with a certainty that \u201copportunity is created, not waited for.\u201d Focused on \u201crewriting how people experience financial empowerment,\u201d in the crowded and regulated industry, Shah and her organization are \u201cembedding payment flexibility into everyday passions\u201d including NASCAR, MLB, and concerts. To decrease the brand\u2019s reliance on search networks Shah and her team built Commerce Media, a proprietary and brand-direct model, turning a profitability experiment into a fully independent business unit. Shah has also reframed customer experience, typically an \u201cafterthought in fintech\u201d into a competitive differentiator and, as she told us, \u201cfrom an operations cost center to a brand accelerator.\u201d Recognizing that \u201centrepreneurship is about building teams that can scale the mission,\u201d in the past year, she and her teams helped Zip realize a 45% revenue increase YoY. Charlie Smith Charlie Smith Chief Marketing and Communication Officer, Loewe FOLLOW Because Smith is \u201cpushing the boundaries of luxury fashion communication and perhaps even brand communication in general\u201d for the LVMH-owned brand. In a category long reliant on exclusivity, polish, and reverence, Smith and his team are rewriting the rules\u2014and the brand\u2019s renown\u2014by taking LOEWE in an unexpected and different direction, one where irreverence, lo-fi aesthetics, and surprising collaborations challenge convention, and transcending category constructs. For Smith and his team, challenging the status quo is rooted in what he told Forbes is their \u201ccollective willingness to embrace failure enabling us to push boundaries.\u201d Over the past year, Smith\u2019s How to Pronounce LOEWE campaign \u201ctackled head-on that many don\u2019t know how to pronounce our name, something other brands might have shied away from.\u201d He and his team turned a might-have-been-traditional celebrity campaign with Daniel Craig into subversive storytelling, creating \u201ca fresh context and a lot of conversation.\u201d Similarly, LOEWE\u2019s Suna Fujita collaboration reimagined the Japanese ceramist duo\u2019s whimsical figures as an animated universe, pop-ups, and a children\u2019s book, blending artistry with commerce in an entirely new way. Despite a challenging period for many luxury labels, in October, reports indicated LOEWE\u2019s sales had increased 27.5% YoY. In March, long-time Creative Director Jonathan Anderson left the label, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez were appointed. John Solomon John Solomon CMO, Therabody FOLLOW Because as Solomon leads global marketing for this wellness pioneer, \u201cthe biggest breakthroughs haven\u2019t come from rigid planning; they\u2019ve emerged from a willingness to seize unplanned, unbudgeted opportunities driving real consumer connection.\u201d The private-equity backed company is expanding into new verticals, markets, and audiences, without a commensurate expansion in marketing resources, but for Solomon and his team, \u201cwith no roadmap and limited resources\u201d, as he told Forbes , \u201cproved that speed and ingenuity can outpace size and budget constraints.\u201d By leaning into other brands\u2019 reach to supplement their own, Solomon and his team forged relationships with Sephora, developing a co-brand product leading to a 50% increase in the vertical YoY; with United Airlines to drive trial in their lounges; and when faced with the challenge of excess inventory, partnered with Hollywood and sports powerhouse CAA, to \u201cturn a potential problem into an opportunity,\u201d executing Name, Image and Likeness deals with tier 1 college football programs, \u201cto ensure Therabody was in the hands of the next generation of elite athletes\u2014who eagerly shared their experience on social media.\u201d Despite their flat marketing budget, Solomon reports their core wellness category grew 40% YoY. Marc Speichert Marc Speichert Chief Commercial Officer, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts FOLLOW Because Speichert, the first to have this title and combination of B2B and B2C responsibilities in the iconic brand\u2019s corporate history, is reimagining where the brand plays and how commercial returns are driven. Recognizing that organizational structure either facilitates or limits growth, over the past year, Speichert has integrated teams once operating separately, telling Forbes he has optimized \u201cend-to-end strategy and execution,\u201d reimagining corporate structure with \u201cmirror organizations...embedding subject matter experts within regions, allowing them to drive local agendas with autonomy, agility, and greater self-sufficiency.\u201d Long synonymous with hotel luxury, for Speichert and his team, driving growth and innovating at scale, has led them to take the brand into new businesses and categories. This includes launching the first branded Yacht voyage in January, which he describes as \u201ccreating something entirely new that challenges industry norms.\u201d At the same time, the brand\u2019s ongoing relationship with HBO\u2019s The White Lotus , was credited by Wallpaper as \u201cachieving something few luxury brands manage: catapulting into mainstream awareness while maintaining exclusivity.\u201d Speichert tells Forbes that these efforts and others are not only identifying and commercializing untapped \u201cwhite space\u201d but also leading the privately-owned company to record-breaking performance. Kate Trumbull Kate Trumbull EVP, Global CMO, Domino\u2019s FOLLOW Because, over the past year, in a category challenged by macro-economics and constrained consumer spending, Trumbull markets the iconic QSR brand determined to \u201cget speeding tickets, not parking tickets,\u201d as she told Forbes . Trumbull leads marketing for the brand and its 20,000 franchisees with an action-first approach believing \u201cpeople will like you for what you say, but they\u2019ll love you for what you do.\u201d For Trumbull and her team, brand actions are redefining \u201cvalue-driven initiatives beyond price (to) break through the sea of the same offers\u201d that have historically driven the category by \u201cturning consumer value into talk value.\u201d Efforts have included countering shrinkflation with MOREflation , reimagining a traditional buy-one-get-one offer as a brand equity moment with their Emergency Pizza 2.0 campaign, and turning a basic $3 coupon on its head with their You Tip, We Tip driver-appreciation effort. With oversight of Domino\u2019s marketing, product innovation, strategic partnerships and national sales, in over 90 global markets, and despite economic headwinds, Domino\u2019s has posted three consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales and order growth. As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up over 6% YoY. Sumit Virmani Sumit Virmani CMO, Infosys FOLLOW Because as he leads global marketing for the India-based IT services company, Virmani \u201cvalues the entrepreneurial attitude over mere skills, celebrating risk-taking, experimentation and recognizing excellence through failures that teach, not just successes.\u201d Despite competing against global companies that are better resourced and funded, it\u2019s this approach to marketing that is driving how Virmani and his team create differentiated and deeper connections to the brand as a short-term and long-term growth lever. Evidence of the approach in action includes Infosys\u2019s move into sonic branding, a strategy more typical for B2C marketers than B2B, where brand identity is typically limited to the visual. Certain that \u201cB2B clients (also) value an emotive connection and there\u2019s no reason for B2B to appeal only to the visual sense,\u201d Virmani and his team launched of The Sound of Opportunity\u2014a sonic signature, which was played more than 5 million times in its first six months. As AI continues shaping and reshaping the marketing landscape, Virmani is determined to ensure Infosys helps lead the way for its clients and prospective ones by investing \u201cdeeply\u201d in its brand. Over the past five years, and according to Brand Finance, Infosys\u2019s brand value has increased by 15% YoY, and the fastest-growing IT Services brand over the last 5 years. Marc Weinstock Marc Weinstock President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, Paramount Pictures Because Weinstock markets the studio\u2019s slate of films understanding that in today\u2019s rapidly changing content landscape a \u201cthink-different mindset is crucial. If you can\u2019t think outside the box and blaze a new trail, you\u2019ll simply fall flat.\u201d Over the past year, and for films and sequels including \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d, \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One \u201d, and \u201cGladiator 2 \u201d, Weinstock and his team were responsible not just for \u201ccreating or recreating a brand from the ground up nearly every four weeks\u201d as he told Forbes but, more relevantly, for leading the studio to five #1 domestic openings and three franchise-best sequel performances, despite sequels typically underperforming the originals. For Weinstock, success requires not just overcoming competition\u2014but inertia and staying home\u2014and makes marketing innovation mission critical, leading Weinstock and his team to work \u201cwith key platforms in ways no one\u2019s ever done.\u201d Examples include partnering with Snapchat to \u201creach every one of their users at once,\u201d and a \u201cMission Impossible \u201d interstitial starring Tom Cruise in this year\u2019s Super Bowl. In the midst of the parent company\u2019s reorganizations and sale process, in 2024, Paramount\u2019s filmed entertainment division revenues increased 67% YoY. Kate Wik Kate Wik CMO, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority FOLLOW Because when a brand is as defined in the public consciousness as Las Vegas, expanding perceptions required Wik to reinvent the traditional destination marketing playbook. With a remit to market and sell Vegas globally and, as Wik told Forbes, \u201cin an increasingly noisy world, with an abundance of competition in every category\u201d breaking through requires thinking entrepreneurially. To these ends, Wik and her team expanded on the city\u2019s entertainment roots by focusing on two marquee events, Super Bowl LXII and Formula 1. But, shifting perceptions for one of the most \u201cbranded\u201d cities in the world, required going beyond \u201csponsorship\u201d and doing things differently. Wik \u201cchallenged my teams and my partnerships with the NFL and Formula 1 to leverage their spotlights as a year-round marketing platform.\u201d By thinking beyond the traditional window, she and her team helped reset the rules of destination marketing. \u201cMy product is Las Vegas,\u201d Wik told Forbes , and the results of her repositioning it as \u201c The Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World\u201d are measured in broadened perceptions of a brand historically linked to \u201c What Happens Here Stays Here ,\u201d and in billions of dollars in direct revenues. Edoardo Zegna Edoardo Zegna Chief Marketing , Digital, and Sustainability Officer, Zegna FOLLOW Because in a marketing landscape evolving at warp speed, this fourth-generation leader of the Italian brand\u2019s founding family says, \u201cmy goal is to make Zegna the slowest company in the world.\u201d Zegna\u2019s approach to driving the business is instead rooted in his belief that, as he told Forbes , \u201cto build a product that lasts forever, you have to be slow; patience and time are indispensable ingredients to create a timeless brand.\u201d This perspective finds the brand\u2019s marketing not disrupting category convention so much as ignoring it. Describing his role at the 115-year-old company, not by his multi-hyphenate remit but as \u201cthe custodian of Zegna feelings\u201d, he and his team see their work as he told another publication about creating \u201cunscalable ideas and then figuring out a way to scale them.\u201d All but singularly focused on giving space\u2014often literal\u2014to stories and the emotions they engender, Zegna and his team launched, among other platforms, Villa Zegna , a private-club pop-up bringing the brand\u2019s heritage to life in key markets globally; turned a children\u2019s book about the company\u2019s origins into a week-long immersive experience in Milan, the first Zenga event with no clothes in it; and are creating Oasi Zegna (a Zegna Oasis) destinations around the world, as places to be slow and as metaphor for ZEGNA\u2019s commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and lasting impact.

(Image credit: Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) April's full moon lit up skies around the world this weekend, delighting skywatchers with a dramatic show. Known as the Pink Moon , or the Paschal Moon, this month\u2019s full moon was the smallest full moon of 2025. This is because it reached peak illumination at apogee, the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, earning its title of a \"micromoon\". Though the difference in size can be hard to spot with the naked eye, the moon\u2019s striking glow created a stunning backdrop for photographers and moon lovers alike. Despite its name, the Pink Moon isn\u2019t actually pink \u2014 it\u2019s named after the moss pink, one of spring\u2019s first wildflowers to bloom. As seen in the photos below, April\u2019s full Pink Moon did not disappoint. Photographer Robbie Pesiwarissa (Robbiesydney Photography) captured the beauty of the Pink Moon from a park in Sydney, Australia.

According to the Weibo-based account Digital Chat Station , the inner display, which is approximately 7.76 inches, will use a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution and feature \"under-screen camera technology.\" Meanwhile, the 5.49-inch outer display will use 2,088 x 1,422 resolution, and this screen will allegedly have a punch-hole camera. Digital Chat Station previously claimed that the inner folding display will have a 4:3 aspect ratio , and they also earlier revealed the alleged display dimensions of the iPhone Fold. Reputable Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since corroborated these dimensions, additionally describing the inner screen as \" crease-free .\" However, talk of the device using under-screen camera technology has not been claimed up until now. That said, rumors have suggested Apple is also working on a foldable iPad, and Digital Chat Station has previously claimed that this device will use under-display Face ID technology , so it could be that Apple is seeking design parity between the two foldable devices. Additionally, Kuo believes the rear-facing camera on the foldable iPhone will use dual lenses and that the device will forgo Face ID authentication, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. Apple will launch its long-rumored foldable iPhone next year with a ~$2,000 premium price tag attached, expects well-connected Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman . According to analyst Jeff Pu, the device recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn, with mass production slated to begin in the second half of 2026 . Foldable iPhone: All the Rumored Features So Far According to Gurman, the device will take advantage of the display, battery, modem, and chip advances that Apple has made in its development of the iPhone 17 Air , which is expected to replace the \"Plus\" model in Apple's smartphone lineup this year.

MacObserver spotted a Reddit post by user daevvan, which shows a screenshot of a notification that reads: \u201cThe iPhone 16 \u2013 From \u20ac39.54/month at 0% APR\u2026).\u201d iPhone 16 promoted via Apple Store without user opt-in The notification came through the standard iOS notification center, using the Apple Store app\u2019s alert channel, which normally only delivers order updates and receipts. Instead of a purchase update, users were surprised to see it used for a direct product promotion. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this happen before and I\u2019m at least moderately annoyed by it,\u201d wrote the original poster. \u201cI do like to keep the notifications on for when I buy something via the app.\u201d Others chimed in with mixed reactions. Some offered advice on how to disable Apple Store notifications, while others argued that Apple pushing product promotions via system alerts crosses a line, especially for a company that often criticizes ad-driven ecosystems. One commenter pointed out the core issue: \u201cTurning off notifications isn\u2019t the point. OP is raising the topic that the App Store sending adverts for Apple products via system-level alerts is weird.\u201d Others speculated Apple may be reacting to slow sales, while some noted they\u2019ve received similar alerts for Apple TV+ promos. Can you turn off Apple Store ads on iOS? Yes. According to our tests, you can. To do this, go to the Apple Store app \u2192 tap your profile icon \u2192 Settings \u2192 Notifications \u2192 toggle off \u201c Announcements and Offers \u201d. Or, go to iPhone Settings \u2192 Notifications \u2192 Apple Store, and disable alerts completely. Still, this raises a bigger question\u2014is Apple blurring the line between helpful alerts and unsolicited marketing? So far, the company hasn\u2019t responded to concerns about promotional alerts in its own app. But if more users report similar behavior, expect this to become a bigger discussion around user trust and notification transparency.

If you've ever bought a lip color just to realize it doesn't complement your skin as expected it would post-purchase, you're not alone. This is a universal experience for lipstick wearers everywhere\u2014and it's frustrating, to say the least. Lipstick shopping sounds like a walk in the park until you realize that navigating the vast world of a million different shades of pinks, peaches, berries, reds, wines, and browns isn't easy\u2014like at all. To narrow down the search a bit, you can call on the undertone matching method\u2014something plenty of makeup experts and wearers do on the regular. But just remember, makeup should be fun! When you overthink the shades and second-guess all your choices, all of a sudden it becomes belabored. Life can be stressful enough, let's not add \"lipstick undertones\" to the list of things that may give you pause. So even though the following are great pointers to help you on your shopping journey, the best advice is to just go with what makes you feel the best in your skin. Undertones 101 Skin tone has to do with the richness of your skin color (fair, medium, and deep for example). Undertones are the colors shining through under your skin. Each skin tone can have different undertones\u2014the main four being cool, warm, neutral, and olive. When lip color doesn't match the undertone, there may be a clash. \"It does matter, because when people wear pink lipstick, the pink lipstick can look completely different for each individual person,\" celebrity makeup artist & SHEGLAM Partner Allan Avendano tells mbg. \"Some pinks can turn orange, some can turn bubblegum pink\u2026It all depends on your undertone.\" However, like everything in beauty, the end-all-be-all is personal preference, as makeup is an art and not a science. If you like a shade of lipstick and it makes you feel good, that's all that matters, undertones or not. So, while identifying your undertones can be helpful, don't stress about it too much. Ultimately, makeup should be fun\u2014not a chore. Identifying your own undertones There are a few ways to figure out what undertones you may have. Here, a rundown: Paper test. \"Take a piece of red paper and a piece of blue paper, and put each next to your face to see what looks more flattering,\" natural makeup artist Amber Talarico once told mbg. \"If you look best with blue, you have cool undertones, and if you look best with red, you have warm.\" And for those people who look radiant with both? You likely fall somewhere in the middle and have neutral. Jewelry test. Look at what you prefer wearing or what you think looks best on you. Golds flatter warm tones, while silver flatters cool. (Of course, if you prefer either metal over the other, just wear what you want\u2014again, this is an art, not a science.) Vein test. This is simple: Look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear more blue or purple, you have cool tones. If they look more green, you're warm. And if they look like a mix of both, you have neutral. A quiz! Lucky you: We developed an easy quiz to help you figure out your own undertones. If you need to pop on over to take the quick assessment, please do. We'll meet you back here, ready to help you find a lipstick. Identifying undertones in lipsticks You may have figured out what undertones your skin has, but what about the lipsticks themselves? Yes, makeup has it's own undertones too. For example a red may have more blue undertones (making it a cool shade) or more coral (making it warm.) One way to figure out if the lip color is more warm or cool is to default to the paper test above: Compare the shade to red paper versus blue paper, and see which one it better blends with. However, a word of warning: Identifying undertones in reds and pink lipsticks can be a bit easier than doing so in nudes. \"When it comes to finding the right nude lipstick that matches your skin tone the key is to realize that nudes have undertones too. Some nudes have a pink undertone or an orange undertone,\" celebrity and editorial makeup artist Delina Medhin tells mbg. Pro tip: \"One tip that may be helpful is to look at your foundation color and mix a red or pink lipstick into it so you can see what the color would look like & keep adding to it, get the color to where you want it. Then use this mixture as a benchmark for matching a potential nude lipstick too,\" Medhin says. Cool undertones Cool undertones give the skin a pink, blue, or red hue. If silvery jewelry complements your skin best, you just might have cool undertones. This can show up more significantly under the eyes for some (yep, even if you have warm undertones otherwise). As the rule goes, you'll want to pull from those colors to find your perfect lipstick shade. Here are a few base colors you might be drawn to: For brown or neutral shades: Purple, mauve, taupe For reds: Cherry, wine, berry, purple For pinks: dusty or nude rose Warm undertones Warm undertones have a base of yellowish, gold, and peach hues sneaking through. If gold jewelry complements your skin better than silver, you may have warm undertones. You'll want to pull from generally warmer colors for your lip. A few hints to keep an eye out for: For brown and neutral shades: Caramel For reds: Brick, terracotta, candy apple For pinks: Peach, coral, orange Neutral & olive Neutral undertones have the luck of the draw, as most colors will complement a neutral undertone. This means you'll have both yellow and blue undertones, so you can pick from a wide variety of colors without worrying about clashes. Olive undertone is different from neutral (though they're often confused for the same). Olive undertones have a green, gray, and sometimes ashy undertone. When it comes to lip color, warmer and deeper colors tend to complement olive skin best, a few examples include: For brown and neutral shades: Chestnut, hints of gold, chocolate brown Reds: Deep corals, cranberry Pinks: Light to deep shades of peach The takeaway If you've been hunting for the perfect lipstick for your skin but haven't had any luck, hopefully, this guide will serve as a road map. At the end of the day, whatever lip color makes you feel beautiful and confident is the one you should choose, regardless of the undertones.

But that\u2019s not the only major change the company could have in store, with the iPadOS 19 update also being tipped to receive much-needed upgrades that could make it work like macOS on Macs. The report from Bloomberg this week suggests Apple is making wholesale changes across its platforms, and the iPadOS 19 version will not be left out from the action.

He specifically points out that the new iPadOS version could get better with \u201cproductivity, multitasking and app window management.\" He does not reveal further details about the new version for iPad users but these three elements on the platform will definitely give it a big performance boost at the OS level. After all, the company has upgraded most of its new iPad Air and Pro models with the M3 or M4-series chips, which are well-equipped to deliver Mac-level performance on these slates. If Apple does manage to tweak and upgrade iPadOS 19 with these features and enhancements, we could finally get close to the dream of making the iPads an alternative to the Macs or a laptop. iOS 19 And Other Big Updates Coming To WWDC 2025 Apple WWDC 2025 will be taking place from June 9 to June 13, 2025.

The US Customs and Border Protection issued an updated guidance on the reciprocal tariff exclusions for specified products late Friday. Smartphones, laptop computers, monitors, hard drives, memory chips and chipsets will be exempt from the latest round of tariffs, which reached 145% for imports coming from China. While this is good news for major players like Apple and Nvidia, the exemption may be short-lived. President Trump announced on Sunday that he would be placing new tariffs on semiconductors in the coming weeks, which will include semiconductor chips and smartphones. The new tariffs will be announced in a \u201cweek or two\u201d and will be referred to as \u201ca special focus type of tariff\u201d. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the goal of these levies is to bring back smartphone and semiconductor production back to the US - a task that would take a number of years and imply a tremendous price increase for devices with consumers bearing most of the costs. Trump did leave a potential back door for tech giants like Apple, stating that there will be \u201cflexibility with some companies in the sector\u201d.

(Reuters) Indonesia will seek to strike trade, investment and financial-sector deals in week-long talks in Washington aimed at forestalling or mitigating planned tariffs from one of its biggest trading partners. A team of ministers intends to propose Indonesian investment in information technology and the oil and gas sectors in the US, and closing the country\u2019s multibillion-dollar trade gap with the world\u2019s largest economy by buying more American goods, among other measures, officials said Monday in Jakarta. \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs and non-tariffs that will be part of our negotiations,\u201d said Airlangga Hartarto, the coordinating economic minister leading the delegation. He said the team from Indonesia, which he described as \u201camong the first nations\u201d to hold talks in Washington, plans to meet April 16-23 with the US trade representative, the Treasury secretary, the commerce secretary and the secretary of state to negotiate tariffs. Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy is among the nations hardest hit globally by tariffs planned by US President Donald Trump, facing the prospect of a 32% levy on goods ranging from palm oil to apparel and footwear. The resource-rich nation last year had a surplus of around $18 billion in trade with the US. Hartarto was speaking after officials convened for several hours Monday to discuss and strategies to reach better terms with the US even beyond trade. The government has prepared a list of commodities it could import in greater quantities from the US and investment offers for US companies. He added that some Indonesian companies are also seeking to offer investment in the US as part of the negotiations. Hartarto said one topic up for discussion included rules that require companies in Indonesia to locally source some content of their goods sold domestically, long a sticking point with foreign investors such as Apple Inc. President Prabowo Subianto last week said the rules needed to be eased to make Indonesia more competitive. The meeting included representatives from the ministries of energy, finance and state-owned enterprises, as well as investment officials and the country\u2019s Financial Services Regulator. Others involved in the trip to the US include Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Foreign Minister Sugiono, Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Djiwandono and Mari Pangestu, a former trade minister and current member of Indonesia\u2019s National Economic Council advisory body.

With a sleek clamshell design and innovative features, this device could reshape the way you think about portable smartphone technology. If you\u2019re looking for a compact yet powerful device, the iPhone Flip might be the perfect upgrade. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details on why it\u2019s capturing so much attention. Watch this video on YouTube . Liquid Hinge Technology: A Leap in Foldable Displays A standout feature of the iPhone Flip is its liquid hinge technology , a significant advancement in foldable displays. Unlike many current foldable phones that struggle with visible creases on their screens, Apple\u2019s liquid hinge is designed to eliminate this issue entirely. This innovation not only enhances the display\u2019s visual appeal but also improves the tactile experience, offering a smoother and more premium feel every time you interact with the device. Apple\u2019s deliberate approach to perfecting this technology highlights its commitment to quality. While competitors like Samsung and Motorola have been refining their foldable designs for years, Apple has taken its time to deliver a more durable and polished product. For you, this means a foldable phone that\u2019s built to last and ready to provide a seamless experience from the moment it\u2019s in your hands. Compact Design with Advanced Battery Technology The iPhone Flip is expected to set a new standard for compactness and portability. With a slim profile of just 5.5mm when unfolded , the device will be thinner and lighter than many of its competitors. This is made possible by Apple\u2019s use of innovative carbon battery technology , which allows for a sleek design without compromising on battery life. As a result, you can enjoy a device that is both stylish and functional. When folded, the iPhone Flip\u2019s compact size makes it incredibly easy to carry, whether in your pocket or bag. Despite its portability, the device is expected to deliver battery performance comparable to current iPhone models. This ensures you won\u2019t have to sacrifice functionality or endurance for the sake of convenience, making it an ideal choice for users who are always on the go. Enhanced Displays for Seamless Usability The iPhone Flip will feature a foldable main display that matches the size and functionality of standard iPhones when unfolded. This ensures a familiar experience for users already accustomed to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Additionally, the device will include a rear mini-display , designed for quick tasks such as checking notifications, controlling music, or viewing widgets. This secondary screen enhances usability, especially when the phone is folded, allowing you to perform essential tasks without needing to open the device fully. Apple\u2019s renowned iOS optimization is expected to play a crucial role in making sure the foldable design integrates seamlessly with apps and features. For you, this means minimal adjustments to your daily workflow and a user experience that feels intuitive and natural. The combination of hardware innovation and software refinement ensures that the iPhone Flip will deliver the high-quality performance you\u2019ve come to expect from Apple. Who Will Benefit Most from the iPhone Flip? The iPhone Flip is designed for users who value portability and innovative innovation . If you\u2019ve been a fan of smaller iPhones, such as the Mini series, but want access to the latest technology, this device could be the ideal choice. Its clamshell design and compact form factor make it perfect for those who prioritize convenience without compromising on performance. As a non-Pro model, the iPhone Flip is expected to feature two cameras : a wide lens and an ultra-wide lens. This aligns with Apple\u2019s strategy of offering high-quality photography capabilities in its standard models while reserving advanced features, such as telephoto lenses, for Pro versions. Whether you\u2019re capturing stunning landscapes or everyday moments, the iPhone Flip is likely to deliver impressive results. Release Date and Pricing The iPhone Flip is anticipated to debut in 2026, potentially alongside the iPhone 18 series. Early reports suggest a starting price of around $899 , though this could vary depending on tariffs and market conditions. While it may not be the most affordable foldable phone on the market, its premium features and Apple\u2019s reputation for quality are expected to make it a compelling option for many users. For those seeking a device that combines portability, innovation, and seamless integration with the iOS ecosystem, the iPhone Flip promises to be a strong contender. Its anticipated release marks Apple\u2019s bold entry into the foldable phone market, offering a glimpse into the future of smartphone technology.

Since then, the game has grown into one of the biggest word games in recent memory. Wardle initially created the game for his partner before releasing it to the public, and then The New York Times bought it in 2022 . CNET's Gael Cooper has loads of tips and tricks to tackle each Wordle puzzle, but if you've completed today's game -- or just love puzzle games -- these alternatives are well worth your time. Wordle asks players to figure out a five-letter word in six or fewer guesses (we have a two-step strategy to help you solve the puzzle every time ). After each guess, the game shows gray blocks for the wrong letters, yellow blocks for the right letters in the wrong spot and green blocks for the right letters in the correct spot. It's addictive, but after you solve the daily puzzle or use up all your guesses, you have to wait until the next day to play again. You've likely already learned some tips, tricks and lessons from the popular word game , so why not apply your newly honed problem-solving skills to other puzzles, too? After all, Wordle isn't the only game in town. Here are 10 other puzzle games like Wordle you'll likely enjoy. Connections I know it's old, but I'm not even going to try to figure this out. New York Times/CNET Another New York Times-owned puzzle, Connections is a tricky word game. \"Players must select four groups of four words without making more than four mistakes,\" the New York Times wrote on X , formerly Twitter. There are also four color-coded difficulty levels for each game; yellow is the easiest, then green, the blue and finally purple. The game is also similar to the BBC quiz show Only Connect, and the show's host took to X to point out the connection. See what I did there? You can play Connections on any web browser, but you need a New York Times subscription ( which starts at $1 a week ) to play. Strands James Martin/CNET Strands is another New York Times-owned puzzle, but this game resembles a word search more so than Wordle and Connections. This game presents a theme every day to help you find words in a grid. In Strands words can appear forwards, backward, top-to-bottom or any number of ways in a traditional word search, and words can also form in the shape of an \"L\" or have a zigzag in them. When you find a word, tap the first letter and drag your finger to the other letters. Every letter in the puzzle is used, so if you still have letters that aren't connected to words, you aren't finished yet. You can play Strands on any web browser, but you need a New York Times subscription ( again, $1 a week ) to play. Quartiles Apple/CNET Quartiles is a new word game Apple News Plus subscribers can access on their iPhone or iPad that's running iOS 17.5 or later. In this word game, you're given 20 tiles with letters on them, and you're trying to put them together to form different words. The longest words are four-tiles long, and these are called Quartiles. The game can be tough, but finding just one of the Quartiles is as satisfying as remembering something that was just on the tip of your tongue. You can play Quartiles on an iPhone or iPad, but you need an Apple News subscription ( which starts at $13 a month ) to play. Multiple Wordle spinoffs: Dordle, Quordle, Octordle and Sedecordle Quordle has you solve four word puzzles at once which sounds daunting. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Getty Images Are you up for a challenge? If you love Wordle and want puzzle games that take more brain power, you'll want to check out either Dordle , Quordle , Octordle or Sedecordle . Each of these word games resembles Wordle, but they add more rows, columns and words to solve. Each game requires you to simultaneously solve a different number of words at once: Dordle has you solving two words, Quordle four at once, Octordle eight at once, and Sedecordle a whopping 16. Good luck. You can play Dordle , Quordle , Octordle or Sedecordle on any web browser. Lewdle \"Lewdle is a game about rude words,\" this game's content advisory reads. \"If you're likely to be offended by the use of profanity, vulgarity or obscenity, it likely isn't for you.\" Translation: It's Wordle, but with bad words. The words range from mild \u2014 like poopy \u2014 to words that would make a sailor blush. Thankfully, despite this game's content warning, slurs are not included . Like Wordle, gray, yellow and green blocks are used in the same way and there's only one puzzle per day. So go forth and let the bad words flow! You can play Lewdle on any web browser. You can also download this title from Apple's App Store or the Google Play store. Antiwordle Not off to a great start with this Antiwordle puzzle. Antiwordle/CNET Tired of seeing those grey, yellow and green blocks plastered all over your social media feed? Give Antiwordle a try. While Wordle wants you to guess a word in as few tries as possible, Antiwordle wants you to avoid the word by guessing as many times as possible. When you guess, letters will turn gray, yellow or red. Gray means the letter isn't in the word and can't be used again, yellow means the letter is in the word and must be included in each subsequent guess and red means the letter is in the exact position within the word and is locked in place. If you can use every letter on the keyboard without getting the word correct, you win. Honestly, I've found this version of Wordle to be much harder than the original. You can play Antiwordle on any web browser. Absurdle Absurdle bills itself as the \"adversarial version\" of Wordle. While Wordle nudges you in the right direction with each guess, Absurdle is trying to avoid giving you the correct answer. According to the game's website, \"With each guess, Absurdle reveals as little information as possible, changing the secret word if need be.\" Absurdle doesn't pick a word at the beginning of the game for the player to guess. Instead, it uses the player's guesses to narrow its list of words down in an effort to make the game go as long as possible. The final word might not even include a yellow letter from one of your earlier guesses either. You can guess as many times as you want, which is helpful, and the best score you can get is four. Have fun! You can play Absurdle on any web browser. For more word game fun, check out CNET's Wordle tips , the best Wordle jokes and everything you need to know about the word game .

A link in the message points to a realistic website where you are asked to enter more details and make a small payment\u2014while behind the scenes, cybercriminals hoover up your information and credit card digits in real time. These messages originate from one prolific collection of loosely linked cybercriminals: \u201csmishing\u201d syndicates. This article is part of WIRED's Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of . You can read the rest of the series here . Over the past three years, these Chinese-speaking fraudsters have developed and operated the world\u2019s foremost smishing operation, spamming millions of people with text messages and likely stealing millions of dollars in the process. The term \u201csmishing\u201d is a mashup of SMS and phishing emails , which try to trick people into handing over personal details. Text messages, though, add a layer of urgency and may catch people off-guard as they go about their busy day. Now, these groups are quickly adapting their methods and expanding their scamming, security experts say. \u201cThey operate very similar to a [legitimate] business in a lot of ways,\u201d says Grant Smith, the founder of offensive cybersecurity firm Phantom Security who last year hacked one Chinese-language group and uncovered how its internal phishing kits function. \u201cThe vast majority of the kits I see nowadays are surprisingly well put together,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey are constantly developing these, constantly updating them, making them look better, making them more secure.\u201d Multiple Chinese-speaking smishing groups and individual actors are involved in the ongoing development of new techniques and running the large-scale fraud. Often, groups will even sell the kits they develop to less sophisticated cybercriminals to easily operate. Ford Merrill, a security researcher at SecAlliance, part of the CSIS Security Group, has been tracking the syndicates for two years and says there are now seven \u201cmajor\u201d Chinese \u201cphishing-as-a-service\u201d actors. \u201cThey have been enabling global SMS-based phishing campaigns at a massive scale since early 2023 onwards,\u201d he tells WIRED. Criminals will create websites impersonating companies or brands\u2014such as postal services, tax authorities, telecoms, utilities companies, and increasingly payment providers\u2014and then send texts (either SMS, encrypted iMessage, or RCS) that entice people to enter their personal information and bank cards on the fraudulent websites. This process requires the fraudsters to register thousands of domains and use Apple iCloud accounts. One of the most prominent of the smishing actors is often referred to as the Smishing Triad\u2014although security researchers group Chinese-speaking threat actors and affiliates in different ways\u2014which has impersonated organizations and brands in at least 121 countries, according to recent research by security company Silent Push. Around 200,000 domains have been used by the group in recent years, the research says, with around 187 top-level domains\u2014such as .top, .world, and .vip\u2014being used. Across one recent 20-day period, there were more than 1 million page visits to scam websites used by the Smishing Triad, according to Silent Push. Besides collecting names, emails, addresses, and bank card details, the websites also prompt people to enter one-time passwords or authentication codes that allow the criminals to add bank cards to Apple Pay or Google Wallet , allowing them to use the cards while on the other side of the world. \u201cThey have effectively turned the modern digital wallet, like Apple Pay or Google Wallet, into the best card-cloning device we\u2019ve ever invented,\u201d Merrill says. In Telegram groups linked to the cybercriminal organizations, some members share photos and videos of bank cards being added to digital wallets on iPhones and Androids. For instance, in one video, scammers allegedly show off dozens of virtual cards that they have added to phones they are using. Merrill says the criminals may not make payments using the cards they\u2019ve added to digital wallets straightaway, but it probably won\u2019t take long. \u201cWhen we first started seeing this, they would wait between 60 and 90 days before actually stealing money from the cards,\u201d he explains, adding that at first the criminals would let the cards \u201cage\u201d on a device in an attempt to look legitimate. \u201cNowadays you would be lucky if they wait seven days or even a couple days. Once they hit the card, they hit it hard and fast.\u201d \u201cSecurity is core to the Google Wallet experience, and we work closely with card issuers to prevent fraud,\u201d says Google communications manager Olivia O'Brien. \u201cFor example, banks notify customers when their card has been added to a new Wallet, and we provide signals to help issuers detect fraudulent behavior so they can decide whether to approve added cards.\u201d Apple did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. The giant scam ecosystem is powered in part by commercial underground scamming services. Findings from security firm Resecurity , which has tracked the Smishing Triad for more than two years, says the group has been using \u201cbulk\u201d SMS and message-sending services as it has expanded the number of messages it sends. Meanwhile, as multiple security researchers have noted, the Smishing Triad group also uses its own software, called Lighthouse, to collect, manage, and store people's personal information and card details. A video of the Lighthouse software originally shared on Telegram and republished by Silent Push shows how the system collects card details. The latest version of the software, which was updated in March this year, \u201ctargets dozens of financial brands\u201d including PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe, Silent Push says . In addition, the research says, Australian banking brands appear to be impersonated, indicating a potential further expansion of targets. The smishing groups are constantly improving their own scamming software. Smith, the researcher who hacked a smishing gang, says he has seen groups operating their own development pipelines for their software and systems. \u201cRecently they were using some custom-made software that they had to basically replicate Jira and have tickets open for any issues with the platform and any customer complaints,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey would assign them to team members.\u201d Chinese smishing groups do not appear to be slowing down. The cybercriminals are behind huge waves of toll road text scams sweeping across the United States this year, says Shawn Loveland, the chief operating officer at Resecurity. \u201cThey\u2019re increasing in their scale and their volume of attacks,\u201d he says. Loveland says there may be multiple ways to limit the effectiveness of smishing operations. Domain registrars could get better at detecting fraudulent websites, for example, and improved spam filtering on messages would help potential victims. Plus, law enforcement could target the platforms and systems they use to create accounts and send messages. Making it harder for smishing groups to successfully operate could reduce profits and have a cooling effect on the surging criminal ecosystem, Loveland says. \u201cCriminals have a supply chain, and you don't have to go after all the components in the supply chain,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can go after choke points in the supply chain.\u201d You Might Also Like \u2026 In your inbox: Will Knight's AI Lab explores advances in AI The Trump tariffs are how everything works now Big Story: If Anthropic succeeds , a nation of benevolent AI geniuses could be born Scientists claim to have brought back the dire wolf Special Edition: The most dangerous hackers you\u2019ve never heard of Matt Burgess is a senior writer at WIRED focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in Europe.

It\u2019s not every day that Softcat is acquisitive, and there were other M&A moves that also deserve to be recorded on the pages of MicroScope. Softcat: The channel player has moved beyond a policy of relying on organic growth and made the historic decision to acquire specialist data and artificial intelligence (AI) consultancy Oakland . The motivation behind the move is to strengthen Softcat \u2019s ability to support customer data needs and strengthen its position against a backdrop of users deploying more AI tools. \u201cData is one of the biggest opportunities ahead of us as the innovation in technology continues to shift rapidly towards a more automated and AI-driven world,\u201d said Graham Charlton, Softcat CEO. \u201cOur customers need the right expertise to navigate this, so combining our market presence and broad portfolio with Oakland\u2019s specialist capabilities will allow us to support them at every stage. Joining forces with Oakland is a great fit with our strategy and, most importantly, our culture.\u201d In response, Richard Corderoy, Oakland CEO, said: \u201cBy combining our deep expertise in data and AI consulting with Softcat\u2019s extensive portfolio and market presence, we can deliver unparalleled value and innovation to our clients. This partnership marks a significant milestone in our journey, and we\u2019re looking forward to achieving great things together.\u201d Exertis IT: The distributor was also actively expanding its options, with a move to acquire Apple Service Provider Group 8, as well as announcing plans to lease a larger facility to support its circular economy offering. Group 8 provides support and repair services to Apple users. It has been going for more than two decades, and is in a position to provide a collect and repair service that covers the UK. Rod McCarthy, group managing director of Exertis IT , said the deal would add more depth to its circular economy offering alongside its MTR business: \u201cThe acquisition of Group 8 is a fantastic addition to Exertis IT\u2019s group service strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWith circular economy regulations on the horizon, Group 8 joining our business is an integral part of our strategy to progress our business, and those of our customers\u2019, into the second life market.\u201d Group 8 business owners Terry Fannin, Veronica Child and David Meehan will continue working in the business. Focus Group: A desire to strengthen a position in vertical markets, particularly in the legal and education sectors, was the main motivation for the deal to pick up Matrix247 . The tie-up will generate a group with a combined team of more than 1,000 experts, and add more depth to the Focus business proposition. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome the Matrix247 team on board,\u201d said Neil Hall, CEO at Focus Group . \u201cThe team\u2019s technical and service capabilities have resulted in an excellent rate of growth for the business, and they have an enviable ability to attract and convert new customers, while confidently delivering and supporting new implementations. We\u2019re eager to continue building upon this success and the partnership will further enhance our CCaaS and Managed IT offering for the wider group.\u201d Matrix247 will continue to operate under its respective brand name for now, and the firm is viewing the acquisition as a chance to provide significant opportunities. Stephen Pritchard, CEO of Matrix247, said: \u201cJoining forces with Focus Group is an exciting step forward for Matrix247. It\u2019s clear we share a like-minded vision, and this partnership enables us to leverage the combined strengths of Matrix247\u2019s and Focus Group\u2019s proficiency in comms, IT and cyber security.\u201d Read more on Managed IT Services Channel catch-up: News in brief By: Simon Quicke Questions over the future of Exertis as DCC signals break-up By: Simon Quicke Channel roundup: Who's gone where?

Most Read from Bloomberg How Did This Suburb Figure Out Mass Transit? The Secret Formula for Faster Trains Even Oslo Has an Air Quality Problem NYC Tourist Helicopter Crashes in Hudson River, Killing Six Lisbon Mayor Wants Companies to Help Fix City\u2019s Housing Shortage The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index extended declines for a fifth day, falling a total of 3.3% during that stretch. While Treasuries and stocks rallied on news that President Donald Trump will delay levies on some popular consumer electronics, sentiment on the dollar was undermined by his warnings that the exemption will prove temporary. Protracted selloffs in the greenback and Treasuries \u2014 typically seen as havens in turbulent times \u2014 have exacerbated concerns that investors are lightening up on US assets in the face of tectonic trade policy shifts and broader political uncertainty. Listen to the Here\u2019s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Weakness in the dollar and Treasuries is a \u201chorrible, toxic combination,\u201d said Jordan Rochester, head of macro strategy for EMEA at Mizuho International Plc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index finished Monday down 0.3%. The gauge has fallen about 6.1% so far this year, on track for its biggest annual loss since 2017. Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Positioning in the options market suggested traders were hedging against further declines. An index measuring three-month risk reversals \u2014 or the spread between call and put options \u2014 on the dollar against its major peers has dropped to a five-year low. That indicates greater demand for put options that would benefit from a weaker dollar than for call options that would gain from a stronger one. The S&P 500 index gained 0.8% on Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 4.38%. A five-day bond market selloff unleashed by anxiety over Trump\u2019s trade war sent 10-year Treasury yields to the biggest weekly surge in over two decades last week. Lasting damage? The discussion that has dominated Wall Street for much of the past week has centered on whether Trump\u2019s actions, even if they are eventually reversed, have inflicted lasting damage to the idea that the US dollar and Treasuries are the ultimate risk-free assets. \u201cWe are talking about a regime change in the way the market views the dollar, particularly during times of global financial stress,\u201d Steve Barrow, a strategist at Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019d note that the other key component of the US\u2019s safe-asset allure \u2013 the Treasury market \u2013 has not been particularly safe.\u201d Story Continues That view was echoed by Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at MUFG Bank, who focused on weekend remarks from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stressing a longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the technology sector. \u201cIt is difficult to see any fundamental factor that will likely improve investor sentiment,\u201d Halpenny wrote in a report. \u201cKey levels were broken last week for the dollar.\u201d One-week risk reversals on the Bloomberg dollar index moved toward parity for the first time in five days, a sign that traders are becoming less bearish on the greenback. Still, the gauge has remained in negative territory for a third straight day, with bearish sentiment toward the US currency at levels unseen since the pandemic. \u201cTrump\u2019s actions have persistently damaged the \u2018US brand\u2019,\u201d wrote Dana Malas, a strategist at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. \u201cThis means that dollar assets, both inside and outside the US, should continue to carry higher risk premiums.\u201d Almost 80% of respondents to a Bloomberg survey predicted the dollar would weaken further over the next month, the biggest proportion of bears since the surveys began in 2022. Strategists at the biggest Wall Street banks also see the potential for further weakness. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts suggested investors remain bearish the dollar, especially against the yen and euro, as there\u2019s still a chance of a US recession. Mizuho Bank Ltd. anticipates the US currency may fall another 5% on a trade-weighted basis before rebounding, based on how it traded in 2017-18 and during the pandemic. \u201cThe design and implementation of these tariffs should have a negative impact on the currency because they have contributed to eroding consumer and business confidence,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Kamakshya Trivedi wrote. \u201cIf tariffs weigh on US firms\u2019 profit margins and US consumers\u2019 real incomes, like we think they will, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar,\u201d they said. --With assistance from Michael G.

The Argentine star's contract expires at the end of 2025 and he could soon sign a new deal that would keep him at the club until at least the end of 2026 JUAN CASTRO RYAN MITCHELL Actualizado 14/04/2025 - 04:52 CDT Compartir en Facebook Compartir en Twitter Compartir en Telegram Compartir en Whatsapp Enviar por email L eo Messi's contract expires in December 2025... and Inter Miami intends to renew it as soon as possible in order to ensure his presence at the inauguration of the new stadium , Freedom Park, the club's new 'home' which is under advanced construction. For the club, the new venue is the most crucial element strategically for the near future. Lionel Messi and the Herons stay scoreless I Chicago 0-0 Inter Miami I Highlights and goals I MLS MLS APPLE TV MARCA confirms that there have already been contacts between the parties. In fact, they have been taking place for quite a few months, as the relationship between the directors and the Messi family is quite good. In addition, Leo and his family are very happy in Miami. And Inter, of course, are 100% happy to have the star in their ranks. The Argentine's presence has meant an exponential growth of the club in absolutely everything, from sporting to economic terms. Therefore, it does not seem difficult that the agreement will be sealed at some point in the coming months... perhaps even before the summer. However, it remains to be seen whether Leo's renewal would mean extending the contract by one year or whether, on the contrary, it is a longer-term agreement. In any case, whatever the length, the new contract will also offer hope that Leo will play in the 2026 World Cup, something that almost everyone takes for granted, but which is not official and will depend on the \"day to day\", as Leo himself has pointed out on countless occasions. But... what if Leo did not stay in Miami? The options seem few, with Saudi Arabia as the main candidate. But 'Saudi' has a difficult task. Messi and Miami is a happy combination and the Albiceleste captain has said it on several occasions: \"I would like to finish my career in Miami.\" Anything other than continuing his career beyond 2025 in a league other than MLS would therefore be more than a surprise Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who could soon renew for two years with Al Nassr until September 2027, have personalized the pinnacle of football in the last 20 years . 'Cris', almost two and a half years older than Leo, was already appearing at Euro 2004 in his country, while the Argentine's first major event (senior, not youth or Olympic) was the 2006 World Cup in Germany Their relevance remains important in the contexts in which they play: Messi with Inter Miami and Argentina (where he remains an essential player); and Cristiano with Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr and Portugal. So much so that, barring injury, both players aspire to be the only players in history to play in their sixth World Cup in 2026 (there are eight players who have five, but none with six).

An internal assessment memo from a major unnamed Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia highlights how game consoles made in China are still subject to a 145% tariff in the United States, which means that the Nintendo Switch 2, which is primarily made in China, is in line for a significant price increase over the announced launch price of $449.99. The PlayStation 5 is also primarily made in China, so a price hike in the United States is also expected for Sony's system, which has already seen a price increase in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Related Story Wii Sports Was Free Because Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 Fought For It, And He Seems To Think Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Should Be Free Too As Nikkei Asia pointed out in today's report, the Nintendo Switch 2 is also being produced in Vietnam. Last week , we learned that Hosiden Corp shipped quite a few units to the United States last February, more than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. Judging from today's report, however, it seems more and more unlikely that the number of units produced in Vietnam will be enough to prevent the system's price from increasing, given the vast majority of units are still produced in China. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for China, where the console has been delayed indefinitely .

The CA/Browser Forum ballot result will impact all businesses with a website, meaning they must replace their public TLS certificates more frequently than the current maximum of 398 days. On March 15 2026, the TLS certificate lifespan will shrink to 200 days, then a year after that to 100 days. On March 15 2029, it will drop to 47 days. Shortening the lifespan of digital certificates in this way reduces the amount of time a threat actor has to take advantage of a compromised certificate. According to certificate authority (CA) Sectigo, the move could also help to spur greater adoption of automation in the certificate management and renewal sector, reducing manual error and embedding best practice into more organizations. Read more on digital certificates: CIOs Raise the Alarm Over TLS Cert Security Risks The CA argued that it might also spur crypto agility by accelerating the adoption of stronger algorithms and ensuring compliance with evolving security standards. That will stand organizations in better stead as they prepare for the transition to quantum-safe algorithms. \u201cThe industry\u2019s unified support for reducing certificate lifespans to 47 days reflects a shared commitment to enhancing digital security and trust for all,\u201d said Tim Callan, chief compliance officer at Sectigo and vice-chair of the CA/Browser Forum. \u201cThis pivotal and positive advancement for our industry underscores the importance of agility and proactive risk management in today\u2019s threat landscape while preparing for the risks of the quantum era.\u201d However, experts have argued in the past that many organizations will need to adopt machine identity automation tools to manage these risks \u2013 especially as the number of such \u2018identities\u2019 continues to explode thanks to digital transformation. The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary group of CAs, browser vendors and major technology companies like Google and Apple.

News of the surge comes after the Irish data protection watchdog announced a fresh investigation into Elon Musk\u2019s AI engine, Grok AI, over whether it has legally trained its systems on European users\u2019 private data. Two weeks ago, OpenAI announced the largest funding round in history, a $40bn (\u20ac35.1bn) raise that values the firm at $300bn (\u20ac263bn). Speaking at a Ted conference in the US over the weekend, Mr Altman said that the service\u2019s growth curve is steep. \u201cIt\u2019s growing very fast,\u201d he told the curator of the Ted conference, Chris Anderson. \u201cSomething like 10pc of the world uses our systems now.\u201d ChatGPT recently introduced a feature that allows for image generation from real photos in styles which include the Japanese film animation company Studio Ghibli. The feature has become a worldwide trending hit. OpenAI\u2019s office in Dublin hosts operations, trust and safety, security engineering, marketing and legal activities. Last year, the company appointed Northern Irish tech executive Sarah Friar as its chief financial officer. AI systems from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and Meta are currently locked in a battle for dominance, with each tech giant pledging tens of billions of annual funding to build what is projected to be the most important technology of the near future. Other AI systems vying for attention include Anthropic, Perplexity, Chinese-owned Deepseek, French-based Mistral and Elon Musk-owned Grok AI. Apple shares were negatively impacted in March after the company announced that it would need to delay the rollout of key features of its own AI system, Apple Intelligence, by a year. On Friday, the Data Protection Commission announced an inquiry into whether Elon Musk\u2019s X platform has been improperly harvesting EU users\u2019 posts to train his Grok AI system. The watchdog, which has hit big tech firms with fines of almost \u20ac3bn in the last three years, said that the probe would examine \u201cpublicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU [and] EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models, in particular the Grok Large Language Models (LLMs). The inquiry will examine compliance with a range of key provisions of the GDPR, including with regard to the lawfulness and transparency of the processing.\u201d Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news Latest Technology All \u2018public\u2019 Facebook and Instagram posts and photos by Irish and European users to be switched on for Meta\u2019s AI-training system One in ten people now use ChatGPT \u2018We\u2019re going from driving a Passat to driving a Porsche\u2019 \u2013 Athlone\u2019s Zenith Adhesive bought by PE-backed US life sciences group Meta adds Stripe CEO Patrick Collison to board of directors AI medical models \u2018advise treatments based on real-world biases\u2019 Steve Dempsey: AI wants us to forget that hard graft is much more than a means to an end LIVE | Donald Trump announces 90-day pause on tariffs on EU and others \u2018effective immediately\u2019; China now subject to 125pc levy No livestreaming by teen Instagram accounts under updated parental controls The Big Tech Show: TikTok, Tariffs, Trump and an uncertain future for Ireland's tech sector New 3D-printed imitation skin \u2018could take the place of animals in testing of cosmetics\u2019, scientists say Show more Top Stories Business Gap between living standards in Northern Ireland and the Republic widening, ESRI report finds The Indo Daily The Indo Daily: Solving a notorious cold case: The three major clues in \u2018Ice House\u2019 murder of Irene White Life \u2018The drug that changed it for me was benzodiazepine\u2026 then I realised I couldn\u2019t control it anymore\u2019 \u2013 Dean Duggan on addiction Ireland Catherine Fulvio: \u2018I wanted to do something that wasn\u2019t Ballyknocken.

Home News You are here OnePlus 13T benchmark leak puts it toe-to-toe with Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max By Iskra Petrova Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 6:06 AM 1 comment Follow us on Google News OnePlus Up Next: The OnePlus 13 . | Image Credit - PhoneArena A new Geekbench listing has been spotted showing us how the OnePlus 13T may fare in terms of performance, and corroborating expectations about the chip powering the phone. OnePlus, despite earlier saying it won't release any more T-branded flagships, appears to have changed its mind. The OnePlus 13T is now gearing up for launch and has recently been spotted sporting a light pink color. Now, it's made a visit to Geekbench . The OnePlus 13T's listing on the benchmarking website confirms earlier rumors that it will sport the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the current flagship processor by Qualcomm. The entry also reveals the flagship having 16GB of RAM (something that the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max can't boast about). The device appears listed under model number PKX110 and has managed to score 2,900 in single and 8,934 in multi-core tests. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, it comes with the Adreno 830 GPU and Android 15 . The OnePlus 13T's score is similar to the OnePlus 13 , which managed 3,026 in single and 9,036 in multi-core, so the 13T comes reliably bringing flagship-level performance.

Geekbench 6 Single Higher is better Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 3137 Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 3331 OnePlus 13 2967 Geekbench 6 Multi Higher is better Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 9769 Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max 8106 OnePlus 13 9081 View all For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max got 3,331 in single and 8,106 in multi on Geekbench, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra managed 3,137 in single and 9,769 in multi. As you can see, the OnePLus 13T managed to outrun the iPhone 16 Pro Max in multi-core but lost in single. Still, it is slightly less powerful than the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite in the Galaxy. It's worth noting that these benchmark results don't always accurately reflect real-life performance. These numbers are all pretty high anyway and both the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra are incredibly snappy and powerful devices. It's great that the OnePlus 13T will join them up there, at least judging by these results. Earlier, the phone's scores on AnTuTu also leaked, showing another set of promising results from the upcoming phone. Also, the phone has recently leaked again. Reputable tipster Digital Chat Station shared an image of the OnePlus 13T (potentially) on Chinese social media website Weibo, and we can see a bold new design and sophisticated look: Recommended Stories Potentially the OnePlus 13T. | Image Credit - Digital Chat Station There's no longer the circular camera island and now we may have more of a square-shaped camera bump. The phone is expected to feature a triple camera setup with a 50MP primary camera and a 50MP 2x telephoto camera. The third camera is said to be an ultra-wide one. Digital Chat Station also mentioned the phone may be available in three color options: a black variant, a light pink one ( which leaked not too long ago ), and a gray one. It is not clear if one of these three will be reserved for the Chinese market or if all three will be available globally. The OnePlus 13T will debut initially in China and will likely get a global release at a later date. The phone will likely pack a huge battery cell under the hood. Rumors say it may be a 6,200mAh battery. The battery of this bad boy is confirmed by OnePlus itself to be at least 6,000mAh , but the exact number has not been confirmed just yet. The OnePlus 13T is expected to battle the best for the title of the best phone of 2025. It has the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra to face, and the Ultra by Samsung comes with an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite and a refined design, but not too many insane upgrades this year. Also, another competitor of the OnePlus 13T is the iPhone 16 Pro , although the iPhone 16 models have gotten themselves into some huge controversy recently by the fact that Apple has delayed the promised Apple Intelligent Siri.

With reports of innovative features and design enhancements, these earbuds might redefine how you experience audio, monitor your health, and communicate. Below is a detailed breakdown of the five most intriguing leaks, offering a clearer perspective on what to expect in a new video from Matt Talks Tech. Watch this video on YouTube . 1. A Redesigned Look with Advanced Features Apple appears to be reimagining the AirPods Pro design, with one of the most notable rumors being the introduction of a sleek black color option. This would provide a stylish alternative to the traditional white, appealing to users seeking a more modern aesthetic. Beyond aesthetics, speculation suggests the inclusion of mini cameras embedded in the earbuds. These cameras could enable advanced object recognition, allowing you to point your AirPods at an object and receive instant information via Siri. If realized, this feature could significantly enhance how you interact with your surroundings, merging convenience with innovative technology. 2. Enhanced Active Noise Cancellation For users who value immersive audio experiences, the AirPods Pro 3 may deliver a substantial upgrade. Reports indicate that Apple plans to double the strength of active noise cancellation compared to the AirPods Pro 2. This improvement could provide even greater isolation from ambient noise, making it ideal for environments such as crowded commutes, bustling offices, or long-haul flights. Additionally, enhanced noise cancellation is expected to improve call clarity, making sure your conversations remain crisp and uninterrupted, even in noisy settings. This feature could appeal to professionals and casual users alike, offering a more seamless audio experience. 3. Advanced Health Monitoring Capabilities The AirPods Pro 3 might evolve beyond being just earbuds, potentially serving as a personal health assistant . Leaks suggest the addition of a heart rate monitor, similar to the one found in the Powerbeats Pro 2, allowing users to track cardiovascular activity during workouts or throughout the day. Another rumored feature is body temperature monitoring, achieved through integrated sensors. These health tools could provide valuable insights into your well-being, seamlessly integrating into your daily routine without requiring separate devices. For fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious individuals, these features could offer a convenient way to stay informed about their physical condition. 4. Real-Time Language Translation Traveling abroad could become significantly easier with the AirPods Pro 3, thanks to rumored real-time language translation capabilities. When paired with your iPhone, the earbuds could deliver translations directly to your ears, allowing you to engage in conversations across language barriers effortlessly. This feature could prove invaluable for international travelers, business professionals, and anyone navigating multilingual environments. If implemented effectively, it could transform global communication, making it more accessible and intuitive than ever before. 5. Anticipated Launch and Pricing The AirPods Pro 3 are expected to launch in September, alongside the iPhone 17, with availability shortly thereafter. However, these advanced features may come with a higher price tag. Rumors suggest the earbuds could cost over $300 , influenced by factors such as tariffs and optional features like mini cameras. While the premium pricing might deter some buyers, the enhanced functionality and innovative features could justify the cost for those seeking state-of-the-art technology. For users prioritizing quality and versatility, the AirPods Pro 3 could represent a worthwhile investment. What These Leaks Indicate The AirPods Pro 3 could signify a major evolution in wearable technology, offering features that cater to diverse user needs. Whether you\u2019re an audiophile seeking superior sound quality, a fitness enthusiast monitoring your health, or a traveler breaking down language barriers, these earbuds might deliver a comprehensive solution. While the official announcement is still pending, the leaks provide an exciting glimpse into what could be Apple\u2019s most advanced earbuds to date.

Or so we think : the whole business has been massively obfuscated by that special blend of state secrecy and legal gaggery that characterizes an official attempt to do something we really need to know about without telling us. Sooner or later, that scent escapes the kitchen and we know something's cooking. In this case, although nobody actually involved would or could say anything, privacy campaigners and journalists got wind that the UK's Home Office had issued a secret demand that Apple put a back door into its top level none-but-you-and-God iCloud secrecy. Rather than comply, Apple yanked the capability from British users, an action far more eloquent than a press release. It also - we think - appealed the original order. We only think this, because any such appeal can also be secret if the Home Secretary says it should be, and a special independent tribunal agrees with them. Last week, the tribunal decided this was a bad idea, denying the official request for a secret court. The tribunal also said it didn't want to say no because it really likes the Home Office (the UK version of Homeland Security), which says a lot about its independence and the weakness of the government's case. As this case will rest on two impossible things, 1) that any backdoor can be kept secret and 2) that state cybersecurity guarding it will be perfect, sinking our teeth into that nugget of truth will be tasty. Which is good. Secret courts have no place in a democracy. They are officially excused because of cases involving official secrets that would be compromised if produced in open court. But if the case is that the defendant has compromised that information, then it's already compromised, presumably to the very people the secret court is trying to keep in the dark. Otherwise, make the case in public. Details vary by jurisdiction, but individuals at risk can be kept anonymous, evidence produced with redactions, records kept under seal, and so on, but all these are visible and amenable to challenge. It is to the UK's credit that its own secret courts can be unzipped and to its discredit that they exist at all. If you can't prosecute in public, don't prosecute at all. It galls that the guilty go free, but the ability to hide sins at the expense of innocence weighs much heavier. The cover-up is worse than the crime, and secret courts provide a banquet of opportunity for that. In fact, abusing the mechanisms of state security is such a good indicator of bad behavior, it could and should be a crime in its own right. The dark gothic manoeuvers of US President Donald Trump in shutting down criticism seemingly by a combination of punishment by diktat and perverting the invocation of freedom of speech is an exemplar for the ages. He didn't like that there was no evidence of interference with the 2020 US presidential election he lost to Joe Biden, and he especially didn't like that CISA, the cybersecurity agency he asked to produce such evidence, said it couldn't because there wasn't any. In the few weeks left to him at the time, he fired the agency head, Chris Krebs. Now he's back, he's opening a criminal investigation on whether Krebs suppressed freedom of speech by working with social media to reduce misinformation, and revoking not only Krebs' security clearance but that of the entire organization he set up after he was fired. The freedom of speech abuse is bad enough: social media companies constantly promote and downrate what people say in them by unregulated and invisible algorithms, and set rules of acceptable content that users can agree to or go elsewhere. You can say what you like, there's no legal compulsion on a publisher to accept or amplify it. Krebs had no legal power to compel anything here, but a duty to understand and discuss with the companies the harmful effects that deliberate disinformation campaigns could have on the security of the US. By removing his security clearance, and the security clearances within his company, Trump is not only removing his livelihood and thus his ability to defend himself, but sending a chilling message to anyone else who might put duty to truth above loyalty to the Beautiful Leader. Security classification is more complex and nuanced than you might think. It's open to abuse. Its use as a direct, open and shameless weapon of persecution against personal disloyalty is new and heinous. Apple's alleged UK encryption battle sparks political and privacy backlash Just declassified: US senator caught up in Section 702 FBI surveillance dragnet 10 years after Snowden's first leak, what have we learned? No day in court: US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rulings will stay a secret The closest analogy is how the House Un-American Activities Committee under Senator Joseph McCarthy persecuted thousands of people in the mid-decades of the last century for the presumed crime of being communists through innuendo and denouncements. While this was a perversion of government power and McCarthy ended up censured, and although it harmed individuals and America, at the time it enjoyed the figleaves of process and the excuse of a known hostile ideology. Trump's action is one man using the state to attack anyone he feels like, unfiltered, while musing openly about setting the Constitution aside , and using primary tools like funding and security clearance to escape oversight and control. That's an order of magnitude worse. Both this and the attempt by the UK government to hush up its mistaken assumption that state security can be made perfect are abuses of security, made in the assumption that there is no comeback. That the nature of security in the digital age has changed is reflected by many new laws of the past 40 years. That this new nature puts extra responsibilities on those who ultimately control it has not. We need recognition that abuse of the mechanisms of security by the state has much greater consequences now than before, legal recognition with teeth. It may not stop such abuse, but it would be a powerful tool to counter it when it happens. Digital secrecy is a new and powerful beast that is only now revealing itself. We must know its nature, and how best to tame it. \u00ae Get our Tech Resources Share More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense More like these \u00d7 More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense Narrower topics Cabinet Office Competition and Markets Authority Computer Misuse Act DARPA DCMS GCHQ HMRC Home Office ICO NCSC NHS NSA RPA Broader topics Federal government of the United States Government United Kingdom More about Share 111 COMMENTS More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense More like these \u00d7 More about Government of the United Kingdom United States Department of Defense Narrower topics Cabinet Office Competition and Markets Authority Computer Misuse Act DARPA DCMS GCHQ HMRC Home Office ICO NCSC NHS NSA RPA Broader topics Federal government of the United States Government United Kingdom TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like UK's answer to DARPA sprouts new ideas, like programmable plants Updated programs suggest ARIA will keep singing for another year Science 9 Apr 2025 | 29 Brit universities told to keep up the world-class research with less cash Government boasts of \u00a314B in R&D spending, but grant body takes \u00a3300M hit Science 8 Apr 2025 | 56 UK stats body snoozes legacy tech overhaul as Treasury tightens purse strings ONS acknowledges it might be a costly decision in the long run On-Prem 7 Apr 2025 | 15 Data deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI Harnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important Sponsored Feature Home Office haunted by 25-year-old asylum system 'Full benefit' of replacement will not be realized until old one is shut down, projects watchdog warns Databases 4 Apr 2025 | 52 Signalgate: Pentagon watchdog probes Defense Sec Hegseth Classification compliance?

These items were temporarily spared from the 125% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods and the broader 10% global levy. ETtech US President Donald Trump is preparing to impose fresh tariffs on semiconductors , with an announcement expected within the next week. The move marks a reversal from temporary relief granted to key electronics items, and reflects his push to tackle what he calls unfair trade practices \u2014 especially by China. Trump confirmed that semiconductor tariffs would come in the \u201cnot distant future,\u201d adding that there would be \u201csome flexibility\u201d for select companies. While the president gave no specifics, he said a separate announcement on products like iPhones would follow soon. Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote: \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019 for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\u201d Temporary relief for tech firms Just days earlier, the Trump administration had issued tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, memory chips, hard drives, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. These products were excluded from the 125% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports, as well as the 10% baseline global tariff. Live Events The temporary relief was designed to shield US consumers from inflation and prevent further disruption to supply chains. Major tech firms like Apple , Nvidia, and Samsung benefited from the pause, given their deep dependence on Chinese suppliers. Chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor also gained from exemptions on specialised equipment.

Trump reaffirmed that no country, particularly China, would be spared from upcoming duties. A national security-focused trade investigation into chips and semiconductors is already underway. Push to reduce reliance on China \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, as reported by CNN. \u201cAt the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d But for firms like Apple, shifting manufacturing out of China remains a long-term effort. Despite efforts to diversify, around 90% of iPhones are still assembled in China. India has emerged as a key alternative. Since March, Apple has flown more than 600 tonnes of iPhones from its Indian factories, anticipating tariff disruptions. Also Read: China gains on electronics, but India still wins According to India\u2019s Minister for electronics and information technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Apple exported iPhones worth over Rs 1.5 trillion from India in the financial year ended March 2025. Higher prices Analysts from AP warn that fresh tariffs could significantly raise prices for US consumers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max, for instance, could see a price hike of up to 29%, pushing the base model from $1,200 to $1,550. Fully moving production to the US could push retail prices above $3,000 \u2014 a level experts say is unsustainable. China\u2019s counterbalance While China was excluded from the most recent tariff exemptions, it is taking a different route. President Xi Jinping is expected to visit Southeast Asia soon to strengthen regional trade ties, positioning Beijing as a counterweight to Washington\u2019s increasingly aggressive trade stance.

This guide explains how to install macOS on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using nested virtualization. Prerequisites Google Cloud Platform account Basic familiarity with command line and cloud environments gcloud CLI installed on your local machine Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud CLI If you haven\u2019t already installed the Google Cloud CLI, follow the official installation guide : After installation, authenticate with your Google Cloud account: gcloud init Follow the prompts to select your project and set default configurations. Step 2: Create a VM Instance with Appropriate Specifications Create a new virtual machine with sufficient resources to run macOS: gcloud compute instances create macos \\ --zone=asia-southeast1-b \\ --min-cpu-platform=\"Intel Cascade Lake\" \\ --machine-type=n2-standard-8 \\ --image-family=ubuntu-2204-lts \\ --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \\ --boot-disk-size=200GB \\ --boot-disk-type=pd-ssd Note: You may need to adjust the machine type, disk size, and zone based on your requirements and available regions. You need to use an Intel-based machine type to enable Nested Virtualization. Step 3: Enable Nested Virtualization Export the VM configuration to a YAML file: gcloud compute instances export macos \\ --destination=macos.yml \\ --zone=asia-southeast1-b Edit the YAML file to enable nested virtualization. Add or modify the following section: advancedMachineFeatures: enableNestedVirtualization: true Update the VM with the new configuration: gcloud compute instances update-from-file macos \\ --source=macos.yml \\ --most-disruptive-allowed-action=RESTART \\ --zone=asia-southeast1-b This will restart your instance with nested virtualization enabled. Step 4: Connect to Your VM and Verify Nested Virtualization Connect to your VM via SSH: gcloud compute ssh macos Verify that nested virtualization is enabled: grep -cw vmx /proc/cpuinfo Any response greater than 0 confirms that nested virtualization is enabled. Step 5: Install Ubuntu Desktop Environment (Required) Installing a desktop environment is mandatory for this setup. Here\u2019s a summary of the installation process: Install Chrome Remote Desktop : sudo apt update wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb sudo apt-get install --assume-yes ./chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb 2. Update your system and install SLiM display manager: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install slim 3. Install Ubuntu desktop environment: sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop 4. Reboot the machine and restart SSH connection: sudo reboot 5. After reconnecting via SSH, start the SLiM service: sudo service slim start 6. Configure Chrome Remote Desktop service to connect to your Ubuntu Desktop. For detailed instructions on setting up and connecting to your Ubuntu Desktop, follow the official guide . From step 6 onward, you will use Chrome Remote Desktop to operate the newly created virtual machine. You can see more detailed instructions on quickemu\u2019s Wiki . Step 6: Install Quickemu Access VM with Chrome Remote Desktop, and run these commands to install quickemu (quickget will also be installed): sudo apt-add-repository ppa:flexiondotorg/quickemu sudo apt update sudo apt install quickemu -y Step 7: Create and Configure macOS Virtual Machine Use quickget to automatically download a macOS recovery image and create a virtual machine configuration. quickget macos big-sur This will download the macOS recovery image and set up the virtual machine configuration. macOS mojave , catalina , big-sur , monterey , ventura and sonoma are supported. Once the download is complete, a *.conf file will be created. For example, macos-big-sur.conf . Open that file and edit or add the following line: ram=16G Step 8: Start the macOS Installation Launch the virtual machine: sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm quickemu --vm macos-big-sur.conf Use cursor keys and enter key to select the macOS Base System From macOS Utilities Click Disk Utility and Continue Select Apple Inc. VirtIO Block Device (on Big Sur and above) or select QEMU HARDDISK Media (~103.08GB) from the list and click Erase . Enter a Name: for the disk If you are installing macOS Mojave or later ( Catalina , Big Sur , Monterey , Ventura and Sonoma ), choose any of the APFS options as the filesystem. MacOS Extended may not work. Click Erase . Click Done . Close Disk Utility 3. From macOS Utilities Click Reinstall macOS and Continue 4. Complete the installation as you normally would. On the first reboot use cursor keys and enter key to select macOS Installer On the subsequent reboots use cursor keys and enter key to select the disk you named OPTIONAL (highly recommended) : After you have concluded the out-of-the-box wizard, you may want to enable the TRIM feature that the computer industry created for SSD disks. This feature in our macOS installation will allow QuickEmu to compact (shrink) your macOS disk image whenever you delete files inside the Virtual Machine. Without this step your macOS disk image will only ever get larger and will not shrink even when you delete lots of data inside macOS. To enable TRIM, open the Terminal application and type the following command followed by pressing enter to tell macos to use the TRIM command on the hard disk when files are deleted: sudo trimforce enable Apple ID Login I have successfully logged in with my Apple ID on macOS Big Sur. With newer OSs, macOS VMs will usually be blocked from logging in with Apple IDs by default. You can follow the official guide to fix this. However, there is no guarantee that it will work 100%. Good luck! Troubleshooting Common Issues Performance Issues Increase the VM\u2019s resources (CPU cores, RAM) if performance is slow Use SSD storage instead of standard persistent disks Installation Failures grep -cw vmx /proc/cpuinfo returns 0: this error is because you selected the wrong machine type. Make sure you have selected a machine type that supports Intel chips (at least Haswell or higher) KVM permission denied: Make sure you run sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm Legal Considerations Remember that running macOS on non-Apple hardware may violate Apple\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). This guide is provided for educational purposes only. Always ensure your usage complies with relevant licenses and terms of service. Conclusion You\u2019ve now set up macOS on Google Cloud Platform using nested virtualization. This setup can be useful for development, testing, and CI/CD pipelines for Apple platforms without requiring physical Apple hardware. For production use cases, consider official cloud solutions that offer macOS environments in compliance with Apple\u2019s licensing terms.

More Germany, on Monday, March 31, 2025.. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP Artificial intelligence is no longer just the future\u2014it\u2019s now the engine of the global digital economy. AI is infiltrating every sector, reshaping industries, and rewriting the rules of business. But behind this technological shift lies an uncertain reality: AI consumes enormous amounts of energy. And unless reined in, this demand could overwhelm global electricity systems. AI\u2019s Energy Appetite Is Growing Faster Than Expected According to Energy and AI , the latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the electricity consumed by data centers\u2014the nerve centers of the AI revolution\u2014could more than double by 2030, surpassing 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh). That\u2019s conservative against a recent Goldman Sachs forecast that global power demand from data centers will increase 50% by 2027 and by as much as 165% by the end of the decade. At the heart of this surge are data centers\u2014the physical infrastructure that powers AI\u2019s rapid computations and learning cycles. The rise of AI workloads, including large language models and generative platforms, is driving an exponential increase in power consumption that governments, utilities, and tech giants can no longer afford to ignore. \u201cThere is no AI without electricity,\u201d warned Dr. Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA at the launch of the report. \u201cThe energy industry is caught unprepared for the speed and demands of the AI industry.\u201d AI Could Break the Grid\u2014Or Help Save It This predicted surge in energy use poses a defining challenge. But there is also a clear opportunity: if harnessed correctly, AI could become a powerful tool for cutting energy consumption and carbon emissions - by up to around 5% of global emissions. The report doesn\u2019t just warn of growing demand\u2014it highlights how AI itself could transform energy efficiency and reshape our response to climate and infrastructure pressures. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 AI is already playing a pivotal role in making energy use smarter and more sustainable. In power grids, it enhances forecasting and fault detection, allowing for better integration of renewable energy and between 30-50% fewer outages. In industry, it\u2019s optimizing operations to the point of saving as much energy as Mexico uses each year. AI-powered logistics could cut fuel use across transport systems, saving the equivalent of energy used by 120 million cars. And in the built environment\u2014often slow to modernize\u2014AI-driven controls for lighting, heating, and cooling could save 300 TWh annually, the same as Australia and New Zealand\u2019s total electricity use. In this way, AI embodies a paradox: it is both the driver of rising energy consumption and a key to reducing it. AI\u2019s New Era Of Energy-Efficient Innovation The future isn\u2019t only being shaped by demand\u2014it\u2019s also being disrupted by innovation. In early 2025, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced open-source AI models that match the performance of market leaders at a fraction of the energy cost. Its V3 model was trained for just $5.6 million, while reports put the training cost of GPT-4 at around $100 million. Breakthroughs like these are rewriting assumptions about the energy requirements of advanced AI and pointing to a more efficient path forward. Even Big Tech is reconsidering its approach. While companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have announced massive investments in data centers, analysts are reporting a trend of scaling back. In the U.S. and Europe, Microsoft is r eported to have paused several data center expansion projects. The move, spurred by efficiency gains and shifting business models, suggests the future may not be as energy-hungry as once feared. DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough in cutting computational loads hints at a new era of leaner, greener AI. That shift may be essential. \u201cAlmost half of the U.S. electricity demand growth between now and 2030 will be driven by data centers,\u201d Birol said. \u201cTo put it in context, the electricity used for AI data centers will exceed the consumption of the chemicals, steel, aluminum, and cement industries combined.\u201d That\u2019s not just a shift\u2014it\u2019s a wholesale reordering of industrial energy dynamics. It suggests that AI could become the single most dominant industrial force shaping the future of electricity grids, energy investments, and national energy security strategies. Designing AI For Efficiency, Not Excess There\u2019s growing consensus that the solution lies not in curbing technological progress, but in building smarter systems. Jakob Jul Jensen, Head of Business Development for Data Centers at Danfoss, believes the future hinges on better design. \u201cEnergy efficiency must be prioritized and integrated into every layer of data center design and operation,\u201d he says. That means smarter cooling systems, AI-driven power management, and perhaps most overlooked, heat reuse. According to the IEA, the waste heat from data centers could meet 10% of Europe\u2019s space heating needs, provided it\u2019s redirected into homes, buildings, and local industries, impacting the energy system overall. As AI investment accelerates, access to secure, affordable, and clean energy is becoming a strategic differentiator for nations. Countries able to deliver on all three will lead the AI-driven economy and attract investment from the world\u2019s most valuable companies. \u201cThe availability and cleanliness of electricity is becoming a strategic advantage,\u201d says Birol. \u201cCountries that can provide secure, clean, and affordable electricity will be one step ahead in attracting AI investment. Those that fall short risk being left behind.\" That\u2019s why the IEA is taking this moment seriously. For the first time, it\u2019s integrating AI into its annual World Energy Outlook forecasts, recalibrating how governments and industries prepare for the road ahead. \u201cEverything around, above, and under energy is our business,\u201d said Birol. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ignore this. Data always wins\u2014and our job is to put that data on the table for governments and industry to act.\u201d AI At The Crossroads Of Innovation And Sustainability And act they must. Without coordinated policies and innovation-driven strategies, AI could lock in energy inefficiencies that will be far more expensive\u2014and disruptive\u2014to fix later. But by embracing AI-powered grid management, systemic energy integration, and innovations in efficiency and reuse, there is a real chance of turning this challenge into an opportunity driving the development of a smarter, cleaner, and more resilient global energy system. Artificial intelligence is not just the next great industrial consumer of energy\u2014it\u2019s also poised to be its most transformative innovator. Whether the world leans into this dual identity will define not only the trajectory of technological progress, but the sustainability of the global energy economy itself. The question is no longer if AI will reshape the future of energy, but how sustainably we allow it to do so. Follow me on LinkedIn . Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

What it means for consumers if Apple ditches China Warren Masilamony The West Australian Mon, 14 April 2025 3:50PM Comments Comments Camera Icon Xi Jinping has called out Donald Trump's tariff strategy, saying there are no winners in trade wars. Credit: AAP Share to Facebook Share to X Email Us Copy the Link US President Donald Trump has warned that the earlier announced exemptions on smartphones, computers and electronics are only temporary, whilst his administration works out a new sector-specific tariff, which will be in addition to the reciprocal tariffs on China. The levies are expected to force companies to bring production back to the US. The White House says President Donald Trump believes the U.S. has the workforce and resources to bring smartphone manufacturing \u2014 including the Apple iPhone \u2014 back to American soil. Although Apple iPhones are designed in the US, manufacturing has been outsourced to a company called Foxconn in China, since the launch of the original iPhone model in 2007. The Taiwanese electronics manufacturer has sprawling factories in China to assemble the popular device at scale and low cost. However, that could soon change, as the newly imposed 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports make it financially unfeasible for Apple to continue manufacturing in the Asian country. This is not the first time that a US president has raised the prospects of moving iPhone production back to American soil. Back in 2011, former US president Barack Obama famously asked the late Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on the possibility of an American-made iPhone, at a dinner function. \u201cThose jobs aren\u2019t coming back,\u201d the Apple founder replied decisively back then. But that didn\u2019t stop the rumblings amongst Americans on losing jobs to cheaper workers in third-world countries, where labour costs are much lower.

Credit: Annice Lyn / Getty Images A Chinese factory worker assembling the original iPhone earned a basic monthly salary of just $US160 in 2007. This had somewhat improved to an hourly wage of about $US3.63 per hour by 2024, during the production of the latest iPhone 16. In comparison, a similar American worker earns at least $US4,000 a month, with skilled and unionized employees earning up to $US40 an hour, more than 10 times their Chinese counterparts. American employees also enjoy greater labour protection and occupational safety conditions. Chinese companies, on the other hand, have long been criticised for poor wages and unsafe working conditions. In the past, Foxconn had come under fire for installing \u201csafety nets\u201d at its factories to prevent staff committing suicide, due to gruelling work conditions. A UN report on China also raised concerns about widespread unsafe working conditions and inadequate mechanisms to address labour law and regulation violations. Apple had since diversified its iPhone production to India, Vietnam and Brazil to reduce its reliance on China. The South American country is now poised to become part of the main strategy to circumvent around the latest tariffs. But Brazil-made iPhones are still double the retail price than the Chinese versions, which retail at around $US790 in China. Even Indian-made iPhones retail higher at $US900 in India. A typical iPhone 16, now priced at $US1199 will sky-rocket to $US1500 or about $2400 Australian dollars \u2014 if produced entirely using American labour, according to Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan. Some analysts have warned that the retail price could further soar to $US3500 or more than $5000 Australian dollars, after factoring in costs of moving just 10 per cent of Apple\u2019s production facilities back to the US. An American-made iPhone also poses other challenges for Apple, like hiring enough skilled American workers and the company would still be subject to tariff costs for importing parts for the final assembly in the US. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research, said, \u201cIt\u2019s just not a reality that on the time frame of imposing tariffs that this is going to shift manufacturing here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pie in the sky,\u201d Mr Fieldhack said.

Read Today's Paper Apple reportedly manufactured iPhones worth $22 billion in India in just 12 months SECTIONS Apple reportedly manufactured iPhones worth $22 billion in India in just 12 months By Dhruv Mohan , ET Online Last Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 02:36:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Reportedly India now produces 20% of Apple\u2019s global iPhone output; Apple assembled $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in FY25. Local content in iPhones made in India has risen to 20% Apple\u2019s manufacturing momentum in India is picking up serious pace. According to a Bloomberg report by Mark Gurman, the company assembled iPhones worth a staggering $22 billion in the country in the 12-month period ending March 2025 \u2014 a sharp 60% increase from the previous fiscal year. That surge isn't just about scale \u2014 it signals a strategic shift. India now reportedly accounts for 20% of Apple\u2019s total iPhone production, or one in every five units made globally. For a company long reliant on Chinese assembly lines, that\u2019s a seismic move. India Rising in Apple's Supply Chain This dramatic uptick in output aligns with Apple\u2019s long-term ambition to reduce its manufacturing dependence on China \u2014 a move driven by both geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain vulnerabilities exposed during the pandemic years. India\u2019s IT and Electronics Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently confirmed the trend, stating that Apple exported \u20b91.5 trillion worth of iPhones from India in the same period. This reinforces India\u2019s growing role not just as a production hub, but as a key export engine for Apple\u2019s global operations. The Manufacturing Backbone The heart of Apple\u2019s production push in India lies in three main facilities. Foxconn\u2019s mega plant in Tamil Nadu leads the charge and remains the company\u2019s largest manufacturing site in the country. Two additional plants \u2014 one more in Tamil Nadu and another in Karnataka \u2014 are now under the Tata Group\u2019s wing. Tata has taken over Wistron\u2019s local operations and is reportedly managing Pegatron\u2019s India business as well, bringing cohesion to Apple\u2019s multi-supplier network in the region. Together, these three facilities form the spine of Apple\u2019s India operations, meeting both domestic demand and growing overseas shipments \u2014 especially to the U.S. U.S. Tariffs and the India Advantage Earlier this year, iPhone exports from India to the U.S. saw a noticeable jump \u2014 a response, in part, to President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement in February of a proposal for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on imports. Although smartphones and laptops were later exempted, the proposal triggered a ripple effect across global supply chains. The broader tariff regime \u2014 including a 20% levy on Chinese goods and a combined 145% tariff load \u2014 remains in effect. Trump has also warned that the electronics exemption could be temporary, with tariffs potentially returning in a matter of months. For Apple, this creates a time-sensitive incentive: iPhones made in India currently dodge those extra duties in the U.S., offering a significant cost advantage. That\u2019s accelerated the company\u2019s efforts to localize \u2014 not just in assembly but across its entire ecosystem. Suppliers Setting Up Shop As part of this deeper push, Apple has encouraged its global suppliers \u2014 including firms from China, Japan, and Taiwan \u2014 to establish a local presence in India. The results are already visible: companies like Sunwoda, Foxlink, and Aequs are now manufacturing components like battery packs, enclosures, and cables within the country. This localisation strategy is beginning to deliver. When Apple first joined India\u2019s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020, the local content in its devices was minimal \u2014 estimated at just 5\u20138%. Today, that figure has grown to about 20% for several models, a clear sign of progress toward a more self-sustaining Indian supply chain. A Brief History: From SE to Pro Apple\u2019s India manufacturing story started back in 2017 with the humble iPhone SE. That initial step has since evolved into a full-fledged production ecosystem that now includes models like the iPhone 12, 13, 14, 14 Plus, and 15. But for years, Apple kept its top-tier Pro models off the Indian production line \u2014 until late 2024. That\u2019s when the company made a historic move by assembling the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max in India for the first time. This marked a turning point. Until recently, India was mainly responsible for older or standard models. But by 2023, the iPhone 15 was not only being assembled locally but was also available on launch day \u2014 a milestone that signaled India\u2019s growing role in Apple\u2019s global rollout plans. Pegatron, one of Apple\u2019s major suppliers, also joined in to assemble the iPhone 15 Plus. More Than Just Manufacturing Apple\u2019s growing confidence in the Indian market isn\u2019t limited to assembly lines. In 2023, the company opened its first two exclusive Apple Stores \u2014 one in Mumbai and another in Delhi \u2014 offering Indian consumers the full Apple retail experience for the first time. Together with its manufacturing and export gains, this retail expansion paints a clear picture: India is no longer just a backup option in Apple\u2019s global strategy \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a central pillar.

Bitcoin, equities, oil jump as trade war tariff messaging on electronics confuses market Data via Donald Trump Tariff exemptions controversy leaves Bitcoin steady, fuels equity and oil rally. Liam 'Akiba' Wright / @akibablade / Apr. 14, 2025 at 10:01 am UTC Bitcoin held near the $84,500 level on Monday following a weekend of muted price movement, while traditional markets reflected diverging investor sentiment in the wake of the latest moves in US-China trade tensions. The White House initially announced Friday that smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics would be exempt from steep tariffs. The US Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of excluded tariff codes, which would have benefited tech companies like Apple and Nvidia. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later indicated these electronics would soon face separate levies that would not be tied to specific countries. Trump himself contradicted the exemptions in a social media post, stating that \u201cno exceptions\u201d would be made for these products in a Sunday night Truth Social post, saying, \u201cNOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China[\u2026] We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d Several analysts depicted a narrative over the weekend that may be relevant to Trump\u2019s Sunday post, which posits a desire to appear strong in the face of global pressure, \u2013 Trump hikes China tariffs to 30% \u2013 China does nothing \u2013 Trump hikes China tariffs to 84% \u2013 China responds with matching tariffs \u2013 Trump hikes China tariffs to 145% \u2013 China responds with matching tariffs \u2013 Trump says that he wants Xi to call him \u2013 China does nothing \u2013 Trump says he is ready to \u201cmake a deal\u201d \u2013 China does nothing \u2013 Trump rolls back tariffs [on electronics] Trump made it clear that \u201cThere was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday.\u201d However, US Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on Friday indicating the opposite . Bitcoin is trading in a tight consolidation range, even as US equity futures pushed higher. S&P 500 June futures (ESM2025) climbed above 5,460, projecting a short-term target path toward 5,500, up 3.5%. Weekend price movements (Source: TradingView) This bullish equity momentum coincided with a 3.33% uptick in oil prices as traders reassessed energy demand forces amid policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Despite this, the US 10-year bonds and its Chinese counterpart moved modestly, ticking up 0.20%, indicating limited bond market reaction to weekend developments. Gold, which has acted as a defensive hedge during the trade war, declined by 0.11%. The price action suggests that investor appetite for risk assets remains intact, possibly driven by interpretations of the trade standoff as nearing saturation after China announced that it would no longer escalate tariffs. The muted bond and gold response also signal that China\u2019s retaliatory measures and US tariff ambiguity around electronics exemptions did not materially alter inflation and recession fears. Bitcoin\u2019s relative stability suggests that digital assets are decoupling, at least temporarily, from trade-sensitive macro instruments. Yet despite geopolitical volatility, its behavior alongside oil and equities points to lingering demand for risk-on assets. When US markets officially open later today, there will be a clearer picture of how the weekend\u2019s developments will impact major assets like Bitcoin, gold, oil, US equities, and bonds.

Sign up here to get it nightly. David Zaslav is a member of a regular Zoom call that includes Howard Stringer , 83, who once ran Sony; Tom Freston , 79, who once ran Viacom; Walter Isaacson , 72, who once ran CNN and Time magazine; Graydon Carter , 75, who once ran Vanity Fair ; Richard Cohen , 84, retired from his longtime column at the Washington Post ; Nick Pileggi, 92, the GoodFellas screenwriter; Ken Auletta, 83, the Boswell to a former generation of media moguls; and Kenny Lerer, 73, the financial backer and co-founder of HuffPost , now retired from his investment business. At 65, Zaslav, currently the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, is the youngest person on the call. The group has met in some form and with a shifting cast for many years. At Zaslav\u2019s suggestion, it solidified into quite a defined club and a regular appointment during COVID \u2014 10 a.m. every Friday. Health issues form a subtext here, though, given that these are all men of a certain age and sensibility; the full details of, for instance, their trips to the Mayo Clinic might not be directly addressed. It is a social gathering, a \u201cshooting the shit\u201d opportunity in one member\u2019s more or less humblebrag, a kibitzing among men who have known the same people and shared much the same professional dramas over decades. But the impossible-to-ignore friction in the group is that while few members, if any, in the characterization of one of them, \u201cget up in the morning anymore and go to the office\u201d or indeed have formal jobs of any sort, David Zaslav , whose ear they have, holds a significant share of the remaining power of the once all-powerful media business \u2014 their business. He is in a sense the last member of this generation to have his hand firmly on the wheel (74-year-old Bob Iger, at Disney, is always on the cusp of retirement) and, for the others in the group, their last brush with the era of the mogul, such as it remains \u2014 the age in which they grew up. \u201cDavid is the CEO,\u201d says one member of the group, many members of which themselves were not too long ago CEOs. \u201cHe just acts like a CEO. He talks like a CEO. He asks the questions. He moves the discussion along.\u201d Members demur about how much they might influence Zaslav, but all of these men have singularly focused for their entire professional lives on many of Zas\u2019s daily issues and certainly believe they have achieved some sagaciousness. Kenny Lerer bought Martha Stewart\u2019s house in East Hampton so he could be across the street from his friend Zas, who had bought adman Jerry Della Femina\u2019s house; Zas and Kenny, who was once Michael Milken\u2019s PR man and, ex officio, advises his friend Zas on PR as well as other matters, speak to or see each other three or more times a week. Graydon Carter, showing his friend the social ropes shortly after Zas\u2019s takeover of Warner, convinced him to co-sponsor, along with Carter\u2019s newsletter, Airmail, and pay for the bulk of an over-the-top party in 2023 during the Cannes Film Festival at the Hotel du Cap, with, as it happened, unfortunate PR fallout for Zas (somewhat like, given the state of the industry, fiddling while Rome burned). Nick Pileggi\u2019s new movie, The Alto Knights, after being turned down at other studios, was made, at Zas\u2019s behest, at Warner Bros. Zaslav, whose company recently posted unexpectedly strong earnings (followed almost immediately by the personal embarrassment of dire numbers for the Pileggi film), is a man charged with leading the media business into the future, navigating the business out of its cultural, generational, and technological obsolescence. It is a business, said Andy Lack , a close Zas friend and the former head of NBC News , that \u201cwe won\u2019t recognize in five years\u201d and that, more immediately, faces the wrath and retribution of Donald Trump for its news division\u2019s slights against him \u2014 in WBD\u2019s case, CNN. And yet, as the world turns, here is David Zaslav regularly convening a brain trust of white men, all of them New York liberals, with an average age of 80. Their Zoom call as a metaphor for being stuck in time \u2014 another time \u2014 is, in the view of the group, an inevitable, if churlish, interpretation. Yet couldn\u2019t it also be seen (if it needs to be seen in any way), some of them wonder, as a reminder of the values and sensibility that have for so long shaped the business \u2014 as an anchor, in fast-shifting waters, for Zaslav? Couldn\u2019t it? In 2023, David Zaslav co-hosted a bash at the Cannes Film Festival that, in the words of a friend, became an \u201cunforced error.\u201d Photo: Daniel Paik The gradual decline of the media business has now arguably reached the all-at-once stage. Every aspect of the traditional distribution and revenue model is in some form, however extended, of extremis. The long sunset of network television and movie studios has more recently been joined with a new swiftness by cable television, whose 45 percent margins, supporting the industry for a generation, have now marched off a cliff. Against this background, in 2020 when he was merely the head of Discovery with some of the highest profit margins in the cable industry \u2014 but with cable\u2019s primacy already clearly over \u2014 Zaslav, whom his friend Lack characterized as \u201cnot sentimental but a bit of a romantic,\u201d bought the Hollywood home of Robert Evans, the legendary Paramount chief who oversaw the making of The Godfather, Chinatown, and Love Story. (Hollywood nostalgist and Zoom participant Graydon Carter, who helped immortalize Evans in his documentary The Kid Stays in the Picture and has just published a memoir, When the Going Was Good, a paean to the media past, was a key broker in the purchase.) It was a hard-to-miss reach for the symbols and tropes of Old Hollywood status, for which Zaslav was duly skewered (he bought the home, he tells me, for its \u201carchitectural value\u201d). A year later, Zaslav announced that Discovery, his much smaller company, was taking over WarnerMedia, the former Time Warner \u2014 long the dominant company in the media business (which AT&T, in some dumbfounding effort, had bought and then, at a loss to manage it, almost immediately regretted buying). The deal \u2014 appearing to be a case of the dog catching the bus \u2014 put Zaslav under a dark cloud of debt. But it gave him the Warner Bros. name, which he promptly restored, rebranding his company as Warner Bros. Discovery, and put him in Jack Warner\u2019s office (and, not incidentally, Kevin Tsujihara\u2019s office, Barry Myers\u2019s office, Bob Daly\u2019s office, and Ted Ashley\u2019s office \u2014 quite a lineup of Hollywood history) and behind Jack Warner\u2019s desk, which Zaslav hauled out of storage. Members of the Zoom call who find themselves in L.A. get a special tour of the Warner lot and glimpses into the bedrooms and back stairway where the Brothers Warner could nap during the day or do what moguls once did to the willing and unwilling (likely, too, across the selfsame desk). There is hardly a more dismal characterization than \u201clegacy media.\u201d Few ambitious types want to admit to being in it, and some of the biggest modern fortunes have been made upending it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the CEO of Time Warner who engineered a top-of-the-market deal to sell his company to AT&T in 2018, is held in awe by his shareholders for getting out in time. Eight months later, seeing the writing on the wall, Rupert Murdoch followed suit, selling the bulk of his company to Disney. Recently, Comcast announced a plan to spinoff most of its cable-television properties into a new company temporarily called \u201cSpinCo.\u201d but more colloquially, and perhaps accurately within the industry, \u201cShitCo.\u201d Still, legacy media is exactly what David Zaslav is doubling down on. For better or worse, his is a theory of the case: The media business has consistently weathered transition after transition, and there is always a survivor, so why can\u2019t he be the last man standing? Technology comes and goes while entertainment and sports are forever. Aren\u2019t they? Zas rises on a predawn schedule, to which he credits no small amount of his success (he says he built his relationship with Si and Donald Newhouse, major Discovery shareholders, because they too got up early), and, most days, after shooting off articles he reads in the New York Times or The Wall Street Journal to his staff and friends, starts out for his office at 6:30 or 7 a.m. While walking from his home on Central Park West (Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s former apartment, which Zaslav bought for $25 million), where he lives with his wife of 37 years, Pam, whom he met at synagogue at the age of 12 (they have three grown children \u2014 and Zas\u2019s mother is still alive), he\u2019ll make rat-a-tat checking-in phone calls, an hour and a half of walking and talking, down to his office on 19th Street. He is likely to speak to a variety of WBD executives, \u201cgetting the plays for the day, how do we move the ball,\u201d but also regularly to Kenny Lerer, David Geffen (whose house, like Lerer\u2019s, is down the street from Zaslav\u2019s in East Hampton), and former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein as well as the most significant investor in WBD, John Malone (speaking \u201coften not about business, just what\u2019s going on in the world\u201d). He talks too with other machers and gossips he happily lists, including Tom Freston; Allen Grubman, the entertainment lawyer and fixer (also an East Hampton neighbor); Bobby Kotick, the video-game billionaire; Brian Grazer, the billionaire film producer; Jason Blum, the horror-film impresario (and a hopeful one-day billionaire); Len Blavatnik, the Russian oligarch turned international businessman with extensive music and entertainment interests; and Richard Plepler, the former HBO chief (Zas did not, in our conversation, have any women on his call sheet). The media business may be among the last that still burns the phones, its true players dialing as fast as kids text. Indeed, at the top, it\u2019s still a business of talkers \u2014 hardly anybody ever opens a computer. They just talk, have always just talked. It\u2019s a constant conversation, a perpetual Barney Greengrass breakfast, part of a work-life continuum rather than the more au courant work-life balance (indeed, ever piercing the bubble of subordinates\u2019 weekends). The best talker, or at least the most indefatigable, wins. Arguably, this existential struggle is not just to preserve the industry\u2019s profits but the tribal rituals of men (with few exceptions men) who have grown up in it. That might seem, for all the obvious reasons, to raise contemptuous eyebrows. But also, for better or worse, what is being preserved, in the view of many people in the highest show-business strata, is the nature, the very DNA, of entertainment, at least as we have known it. It would not be, among these men, such a great leap to see the fate of the media business as a cultural showdown between the younger, self-serious, wildly overconfident, flatly literal, bad-taste Midwest tech bros in their bid for the attention of the American (or world) audience and the old Jewish guys of New York and L.A. who have for so long in their striving and jokes and neuroses, dominated the business \u2014 that\u2019s entertainment. You could as well see Zaslav and his old-guy circle as a bulwark against all the too-liberal (arguably unprofitable) efforts of an angry younger-demo media hoi polloi to culturally transform the business (Zas is particularly proud of his early decision at Warner to cancel the release of the $90 million Batgirl, which featured a trans actor). Also, you can see Zaslav\u2019s rise in the business as part of an indefatigable courtship of his media betters and forebears. It is no small point that, within this circle \u2014 this deeply tribal community of show-business men, rich ones \u2014 Zas is regarded with great, one-of-us affection. Of course, Zas \u2014 call it the Zas contradiction \u2014 is not really a show-business guy. He\u2019s a numbers guy. Less Robert Evans than Robert Evans\u2019s accountant (still, though, a show-business accountant, \u201cNot artist friendly but artist aware and adjacent,\u201d in one producer\u2019s description). He may hold in awe the true figures of the media and show-business world, but he would fire them and cut their projects in a New York minute. This has created, in the first year or two of his moguldom, a rearguard action of resentment and resistance within the industry \u2014 hence a largely unfriendly narrative (drowned out by chants of \u201cPay your writers\u201d in a speech he made during the writers strike; hoisted for a critical article in GQ that suspiciously disappeared just as the GQ editor was developing a movie at Warner Bros.; ridiculed for his party at Cannes, where a phalanx of aides and security people rushed out to light the way after Zaslav took a small red-carpet stumble on the Hotel du Cap steps \u2014 \u201cunforced errors,\u201d in the words of one Zoom-call member). Certainly, the takeover of Warner shone the media\u2019s own unremitting light on him and on the projects and personnel he has cut to pay down the company\u2019s whopping debt while taking for himself a whopping paycheck, indeed one of the biggest in the media industry \u2014 $52 million in 2024, $50 million in 2023, $40 million in 2022, all on top of a windfall of stock options in 2021 (around $200 million) prior to the Warner deal closing, amounts, in the face of the company\u2019s declining value, even his friends seem embarrassed by. Per one producer, \u201cHe is an avatar of the death of the middle class in Hollywood. In the old days, everybody did well. Now, all those people in the middle have been squeezed. Zas, though, is doing better than ever.\u201d Beyond mogul economics, the criticism has a quotient of snobbery: The Brooklyn-born, state-university-educated Zaslav, a \u201cvery un-Tiffany kind of person\u201d per a Tiffany-type producer, is a media upstart and wannabe who is fucking with, and fucking up, HBO, the new Tiffany Network. Zas, reaching for the mogul mantle, is certainly no Rupert Murdoch, nor is he the wry, ironic, brainy Bewkes or a Bob Evans\u2013type showman and golden-gut hitmaker. Zas can seem more like a sales manager who has memorized the PowerPoint deck (\u201cWe are on offense \u2026 We got a leadership team that is on mission \u2026\u201d). He is famous for his wide-of-the-mark efforts to dress for the mogul part, wearing, when I visited him recently in his suburban-looking office on 19th Street, a blue blazer over a hoodie over a T-shirt. His performance at the company\u2019s virtual town hall after the L.A. fires, a video of which his comms team offered me, was more halting and unsure than the man who had it under control, and whom Hollywood could gratefully turn to, who he likely wanted to appear to be. \u201cHe\u2019s a very effective manager and strategist in these businesses,\u201d said Blankfein about the hodgepodge of cable, movie, and streaming plays that uncomfortably compose modern media (\u201cwhich, by the way, are terrible businesses,\u201d Blankfein added). Zaslav\u2019s comms team has put Blankfein on the phone with me to push back against what Zas seems to feel may be my suggestion that he is less than a true mogul. \u201cBut does that mean he should walk among the giants of Hollywood? It wouldn\u2019t occur to me to put him there,\u201d Blankfein said, meaning, I infer, that moguldom may not be the most relevant skill set for this moment in media time. One member of the Zaslav Zoom call, professing personal affection for Zas, also expressed surprise that \u201ca guy like Zas\u201d had become among the most important people in the media business, by which he seemed to impute (putting aside the paycheck) an uncharacteristic normalcy for a mogul, a lasting middle-classness. Or, as another longtime observer put it, \u201cDavid has made a career out of being underestimated.\u201d Zaslav\u2019s early career, along with being an immersion course in the dense legal, logistical, technical, and personality tapestry of the nascent cable industry, was deep training in the art of dealing with the big man \u2014 which he surely hopes to be but is not quite yet. In 1986, Zaslav left his job as a junior associate at a large New York law firm and joined the counsel\u2019s office at NBC, then owned by GE and wholly dominated by Jack Welch, the GE CEO who, with only minor exaggeration, was largely regarded as among the best businessmen who had ever walked the earth (similarly, he is now regarded, with only minor exaggeration, as among the worst). Welch created a generation of media executives in the GE \u2014 that is, in his own personal \u2014 mode. \u201cAfter years spent working with Welch and presenting to him \u2026 you start to think like him,\u201d Zas says proudly. Zaslav was hardly unique among executives at NBC in embracing the Jack Welch way, but he seemed to have a special taste for it, requiring quite a leap for a Jewish boy into GE\u2019s macho, tight-lipped, towel-snapping, Catholic-boy culture. Zas became a favorite of both Welch (\u201cone of my very best friends\u201d) and Welch\u2019s top lieutenant, Bob Wright, with frequent references to both men continuing to pepper his conversations and, as almost a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 bullet, the reminder that he was a pallbearer at Welch\u2019s funeral. At John Malone\u2019s invitation, Zaslav left NBC in 2006. Holding NBC\u2019s major-cable portfolio, Zaslav had had many dealings over the years with Malone, an early cable-system mogul. While making vast profits off the business, Malone has not shown any discernible interest in media influence, power, glamour, stars, or stories. He is an engineer by training, quite a cerebral one \u2014 media is for him an engineering, rather than an operating, problem, a strategy of spinoffs, debt, and more or less opaque financial arrangements \u2014 with a trader\u2019s keen sensitivity to when markets are moving, telephony to cable to broadband. In 2005, when Malone\u2019s Liberty Media spun out Discovery into an independent company, though one still controlled by Malone, Zaslav, with his long relationship with Malone, became his choice for CEO. Meaning that Zaslav, even with the vast sprawl of his mass-entertainment products, principally has an audience of one: The 84-year-old Malone, who has just announced his retirement as WBD chairman but remains the most significant shareholder, is perhaps the last person in the media business who people still assume knows what he is doing. Which gives Zaslav quite a runway \u2014 Zas must know what he is doing because John Malone knows what he\u2019s doing, right? But while Malone famously gives great authority and autonomy and an open checkbook to his closest prot\u00e9g\u00e9-lieutenants, he is also like a greater force of nature: If tectonic plates shift in Malone\u2019s crustal sensitivity, billions of dollars in media assets could, overnight, be reordered. In that sense, Zaslav is trying to outrun not only his competitors but John Malone\u2019s timeline (a shifting one). Indeed, the 2022 deal to buy Warner might well have been due as much to Malone\u2019s desire to sell Discovery \u2014 but finding no buyer, he merged it into what was, in fact, a spinoff of Warner by AT&T, whose shareholders retain a large interest. Management passed to the Discovery side, making Zaslav the CEO and, in some sense, the accidental mogul. The Warner Bros. television and film business once made $3 billion a year \u2014 last year, it made $1.7 billion. AT&T paid more than $100 billion for Time Warner. Three years later, when AT&T spun the company off to Discovery, its valuation was roughly 40 percent lower. Post-merger, WBD started trading at $25 a share \u2014 at a $60 billion value. Now, says Zas\u2019s friend (and one of his biggest individual shareholders \u2014 30 million, he says bullishly) David Geffen, who was also enlisted by WBD to offer me his Zas endorsement, it\u2019s at around $9 a share (and has gone as low as $7), even combined with Discovery. \u201cWhat a bargain!\u201d That\u2019s the bracing reality that both Malone and Zaslav wake up to every morning \u2014 a curse or an opportunity. The assets of the media business circa 2025 are, in effect, all for sale. Shortly after Comcast announced its ShitCo. spinoff of MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and the Golf Channel, along with its digital fancies Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow, and SportsEngine, WBD followed suit with a reorganization plan of its own, separating its streaming (HBO, Max, and Discovery+) and content-creating (studio and library) businesses from its \u201cglobal linear networks\u201d \u2014 including TNT, TBS, the Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Animal Planet, and CNN, it\u2019s \u201cShitCo.\u201d In other words, escape is on everybody\u2019s mind. And getting out at the highest price may be, given all, the most reasonable move for John Malone. Zas, in the mission of his life, is determined not to let that happen. The Zaslav play \u2014 now, finally, after three years, out of the box and front and center in the company\u2019s messaging \u2014 is a simple and, to some extent, clear Johnny-come-lately one: Take HBO, the Time Warner gold-standard entertainment asset, and infuse it with a miscellany of other broad-appeal content (that is, basic-cable stuff, or \u201ctonnage\u201d in programming talk), and, risking extreme brand confusion, create an international streaming service called Max that might go head-to-head with Netflix. Or even take on network television: The Pitt, a medical drama with the old ER star Noah Wyle, is a 15-episode series with another season just commissioned for next year (no precious, streaming-style few episodes every few years). \u201cThe best storytelling content on a global platform,\u201d Zas pronounces as his strategy. In any conversation with Zaslav, he uses the words storytelling and storyteller \u2014 the media is the \u201cstorytelling business\u201d \u2014 to an all-purpose excess that is surely confusing to actual storytellers. What is meant here, it seems, in a psychic sense, is a connection to the long history of Hollywood and a way to emphasize, which WBD execs do, \u201cWe are not in the widgets business\u201d \u2014 a dig at the tech people (though widgets are the opposite of digits). But also meant is the dollars-and-cents value of the libraries the media business owns and the future, even perpetual, exploitability of that IP. And further, in the blanket use of storytelling as a virtue and an idiom, is the new fungibility of media, neither wedded to theaters, particular screens, or any defined form. We are not in the movie business, we are not in the television business, we are certainly not in the publishing business (Time Warner jettisoned its magazine company \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 in 2014). It\u2019s analog, it\u2019s digital, it\u2019s news, it\u2019s docudrama, it\u2019s fantasy, it\u2019s games, it\u2019s a podcast, it\u2019s a series. That is, content \u2014 that mulch of video, audio, digital, and written culture \u2014 with storytelling the newer, softer word. And we \u2014 WBD \u2014 are the biggest producers of it. And the best at it (four Apple TV+ hits are produced by Warner Bros. \u2014 Bad Monkey, Shrinking, Ted Lasso, and Presumed Innocent \u2014 notes Zaslav, making the point that the tech community lacks serious creative chops). \u201cAnd in the end, that\u2019s what wins, the best content.\u201d But best in media-business language does not necessarily mean best in a creative sense \u2014 rather, it is closer to most, and all things to all people , and hits . \u201cWe have the greatest writers and storytellers \u2014 Chuck Lorre, J. J. Abrams, Bill Lawrence, Mindy Kaling \u2014 we have 80 of those people,\u201d says Zaslav, as though to add them like weapons to his soldiers on the field. This is the up-to-the-minute media dream to supply content anywhere, anytime, on any device. That\u2019s the central Zaslav proposition, to make Max a must-have worldwide streamer and with him \u2014 deeply committed to the lore and thrall of the media business but at the same time a hard-hearted bottom-line executive \u2014 the man to do it. This has so far involved, \u201con our Max journey,\u201d as J. B. Perrette, WBD\u2019s streaming chief who has worked with Zas for 25 years, calls it, a two-year platform build-out \u2014 which can also be read as being waylaid and stalled for two years \u2014 an international dealmaking spree, and a deep investment in big new franchises. It has also involved an industry sense that this has come at the expense of HBO, a downgrade in its stature and resources. (\u201cThey entirely misunderstood the HBO brand,\u201d says one former studio executive. \u201cThey thought it stood for linear-subscription TV while it stood for the highest quality of television available.\u201d) Zaslav seems pained by this but resigned: This is the breaking-eggs phase. And by the way, even if HBO and its vast success and sui generis place in modern entertainment may be part of the linear-television past, in fact, \u201cHBO has never been bigger or more successful,\u201d says Zas. Its longtime management team is still largely in place, and the company vigorously argues for HBO\u2019s continued quality: The Penguin , Hacks , The Last of Us (which was the biggest HBO series since the last season of Game of Thrones ), Succession , and, indeed, The White Lotus , which might reasonably claim to be the moment\u2019s true Zeitgeist hit \u2014 its recent finale was 50 percent bigger than the season before. But at the same time, while HBO might yet be the gold standard, in its mixed messaging, Max (an incomprehensible elevation of the company\u2019s also-ran\u2013never-was Cinemax brand) is the future-looking (and Hail Mary) reboot. On this, the company\u2019s position is wholly bullish: In the past six months, Zaslav says, Max has added 20 million subscribers (it\u2019s actually 19 million) \u2014 \u201cgrowing, accelerating, and profitable and will generate more profit every quarter,\u201d Zaslav emphatically makes the point \u2014 bringing it to a worldwide 117 million yet being in only half of the markets that Netflix, with its 300 million subscribers, is in. Max is growing at a rate that, if sustained (a big if), as it reaches 100 percent penetration will overtake Netflix. And this is before a series of big new franchise investments has come online. The recent announcement of its quarterly results showed nearly $700 million in profits from streaming and direct to consumer. The company\u2019s estimate of $1 billion in 2025 was raised to $1.3 billion. Management has been feverishly circulating a column in Puck \u2014 often a gossipy thorn in Zaslav\u2019s side \u2014 by William Cohan arguing the company has turned the corner by paying down debt and increasing its streaming cash flow. Cohan, echoing the WBD message, extolled the Zaslav strategy of \u201cinternationalizing\u201d Max. And, indeed, it is a certain leap out in front of the loud chorus of the past few years that predicted nothing but a doom spiral. The ceiling, though, may already be fixed. Max\u2019s best hope, if all its dreams come true, may be only to become the sixth streaming service, behind Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, and YouTube. That is better than all the other also-ran streamers but not necessarily good enough to stand alone. It\u2019s in danger, in other words, of becoming no more than another piece on the board, waiting for future media asset builders to determine its future. Even a truly over-the-top success for Max might not do it. The streaming business, which great tech companies can afford to support, at its best produces 20 percent margins, which hardly replace cable\u2019s 45 percent margins that media investors \u2014 like John Malone \u2014 have come to expect. How do you support streaming while keeping investors happy? Can streaming, even with increased subscribers, higher prices, and international reach, ever perform at the level of the old network mass-reach and mass-advertising model or the cable bundle, dual subscriber, and ad-rev stream? Indeed, how do you hold investors\u2019 belief in the very idea of a media company? Well, there is no answer. There is no model \u2014 with the possible exception of Disney with, uniquely, its theme parks; its Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm franchises; and dominance in the family market \u2014 of a media company that can, at this point in delivery-system time, promise sustainable growth. David Zaslav may be looking forward to a streaming afterlife and a place at the table among the streaming giants, but he is still, alas, and even principally, in the ShitCo. cable business. And yet \u2026 the trick of the ever\u2013transitioning media business has always been to manage decline while you pray for better days. Technology companies only exist as of today; the media business is a tension between past, present, and future. The past doesn\u2019t ever go away, television didn\u2019t wipe out radio, cable didn\u2019t wipe out network, streaming won\u2019t wipe out terrestrial \u2014 you just have to be fast enough and ruthless enough to adjust your management of it. While Zaslav may from a certain angle look like a parody of a wannabe media mogul, and not necessarily a very good parody, there is at the same time a view that Zaslav, fairly rare among the mogul set, possesses a level of business self-awareness, an understanding that, together with his mogul dreams, his day job is being a real nuts-and-bolts guy on a tight timetable. His circle, even without prodding, notes his prodigious work ethic \u2014 \u201cpragmatic, straightforward, straight shooting,\u201d says Zas\u2019s friend Bobby Kotick, the gaming billionaire, delegated to offer an encomium \u2014 while brushing past his episodes of ostentation and glamour grabs. \u201cHe really is not an asshole,\u201d defends another friend. As Zaslav works his present streaming strategy, seeking to talk about nothing else but, he is, too, less publicly, deeply attentive to the cable past. For one thing, cable\u2019s profits, while bleak in the future, are still strong in the present, and Zaslav\u2019s astute management of them has, in a surprise to the industry, helped bring down what seemed to be WBD\u2019s unsustainable debt to quite reasonable levels. What\u2019s more, ShitCo. may now present quite an opportunity. The FCC has had under Obama and Biden an antagonistic view of media mergers. The Trump age opens the possibility of creating a big industry utility of shit \u2014 a massive combination of cable properties to maximize efficiencies, margins, and leverage with cable providers. It may obviously seem to be a competitive disadvantage that, while the technology business builds the future, the media business is more often than not surprised by it. Yet that, in a way, is the nature of media \u2014 of the Zeitgeist, of a hit, and of show business. If you can\u2019t roll with it, you shouldn\u2019t be on the boat (\u201cGetting to the other side of the river\u201d is how a weary-sounding Casey Bloys, the 20-year HBO veteran, now CEO, puts it). The future, in the traditional media model, always holds unknown fortune, whether that be the conversion to DVDs that supported a generation or the wild margins in the cable bundle or \u2026 WBD\u2019s Harry Potter series, which the company is massively investing in and is billing as the biggest launch in streaming history. Or its other big number, Superman (the first of a dozen superheroish movies slated over the next ten years to try to turn Warner\u2019s ownership of DC Comics into something like Disney\u2019s gift-that-keeps-giving Marvel and make the studio, just like Disney, a repeat franchise machine). Zaslav is putting a lot of hope in Harry Potter and Superman \u2014 oh, and Cat in the Hat as a central piece of its kids\u2019 build-out \u2014 as both part of the branding makeover for Max (not your father\u2019s HBO) and wishes for an endless franchise future. Hits, at least temporarily, solve all problems. This may seem like a slim reed, but in the past, it has always worked for somebody. Why not Zas? And it\u2019s not as though anyone else has a better plan. Media mogul is not necessarily a job too many people want anymore and not necessarily a job that truly exists (even if the paychecks still do). It\u2019s a cautious industry now and a stripped-down one. What is a media mogul compared with Musk, Zuckerberg, or Bezos? (In the case of David Ellison, who is buying Paramount Global with his father Larry Ellison\u2019s multi-hundred-billion-dollar fortune, what is a media mogul compared with the coddled child of a tech titan?) But Zaslav wants the job, arguably may appear to want it too much, and believes in it, which, given how many people seem to want nothing to do with it, is quite a significant stake in the ground. In our conversation in his New York office \u2014 leather couch, re-created exposed-brick walls, and pictures of the Beatles and Hendrix \u2014 Zas is vastly more earnest than flashy, concentrating hard on the details of how he\u2019s going to lead his business over its complicated hurdles. This may seem like his more natural place: David Zaslav, the office guy. He works earnestly, if somewhat less convincingly, at trying to be the other thing, too \u2014 power broker, nabob, kahuna. But he is still the office guy who, miraculously, found himself sitting in the seat, and can\u2019t believe it, and certainly doesn\u2019t want to get out of it \u2014 its existential condition be damned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be doing this stuff if I were him, but guess what, he loves it!\u201d says his friend Blankfein. Moguldom, even if Zas is an unlikely mogul, is what he\u2019s trying to preserve and restore. And he is playing the part \u2014 or learning it. (In the new Apple+ series The Studio, Seth Rogen says he modeled the studio overlord, a rapacious moron played by Bryan Cranston, on Zaslav.) Indeed, every studio, including Warner, had passed on Zoom-call member Nick Pileggi\u2019s script about Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, The Alto Knights. Pileggi is a beloved figure in the entertainment business by virtue of his contributions to the industry-staple organized-crime drama and mythmaking and his marriage to Nora Ephron. In today\u2019s fraught world, where any green-light demands consensus, Zaslav \u2014 in an example of old-school mogul behavior not seen in many years \u2014 proudly pushed the film into production. Peculiarly or meaningfully, the project has been in development since 1974. Irwin Winkler was the producer then with Michael Cimino signed on as director and James Toback as screenwriter \u2014 but then, in a footnote of ancient Hollywood history, it was put into turnaround when Alan Ladd Jr. took over the Twentieth Century Fox film division. Irwin Winkler, at 93, is still the film\u2019s producer, recruiting in his long, heroic effort to make the film for his 92-year-old writer, Pileggi; Barry Levinson, at 82, is the director; and Robert De Niro, at 81, is the star, playing both Costello and Genovese. Prior to the film\u2019s disastrous $3 million opening last month, the green-light decision was being touted by some in the industry as both Zaslav\u2019s boldness over committee caution and a return to the great age of Hollywood dramas. Now, in similar mogul fashion, blame is being spread around, with Zaslav disclaiming responsibility and with the expectation that heads, though not Zas\u2019s, will roll. Now The Alto Knight s just confirms the Zaslav strategy: Film drama is dead, and building franchises is film\u2019s future. A Minecraft Movie, in which Warner has a 75 percent interest (Legendary has 25 percent) opened in early April bigger than Barbie \u2014 the biggest movie of the year so far! This too is a key mogul skill: surviving flops. That\u2019s show business (said with a shrug). And who knows? Fifty years from now, someone may pull out the Zaslav desk. And a coda. What about \u2026 Trump? In the endless cascade of existential variables in the media business, now Trump! Even if you can will hits into being, and somehow hold together broken business models and achieve new global breakthroughs, now you have to deal with, at some very personal mogul level, Trump. While much of the tech world has decided to meet the Trump phenomenon with obsequiousness, and other media companies are making ignominious deals (at ABC, at CBS), and Comcast, doubtlessly, has a sense of relief that their ShitCo. spinoff includes the lefty MSNBC, David Zaslav remains, uncomfortably, the owner of CNN, Trump\u2019s longtime and consistently most hated media target. This is a confusing place for Zaslav to be because nothing about his career would indicate an interest in news. Nor, in the grand scheme, does CNN seem to be a particularly integral part of his vision for WBD (Zaslav insists it is). In one of his few direct expressions, John Malone has even opined about his distaste for the polarization of cable news, which, awkwardly, is cable news\u2019 bread and butter. One of Zaslav\u2019s earliest decisions in the takeover of Warner Media was not to support CNN chief Jeff Zucker, a Zaslav friend from the NBC days (Zucker was also a Jack Welch favorite). In the interregnum period during the deal with AT&T to take control of Warner, Zucker, accused of a corporate infraction for not reporting his relationship of many years\u2019 standing with a colleague, was ousted in apparent political payback by AT&T enemies. Zaslav\u2019s choice not to save the high-flying Zucker may reasonably be read as an effort to downgrade CNN\u2019s profile and importance. His subsequent appointment of Chris Licht, quite a lightweight, to take over one of the key spots in American news happened without a real search, and Licht\u2019s rule collapsed in about a year. Then Zaslav, again without much of a search, turned to Mark Thompson, the retired CEO of the New York Times, for his reputation as an adult in the room with keen corporate acumen who might be counted on to understand the nuances of the moment. But Zaslav is still stuck not only with a fast-declining business and what can seem like the day-by-day erosion of one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands and all the negative media attention that brings, but because of CNN, he now has Trump as a Damocles potentially threatening the entire WBD business. This is too against the background that Time Warner, in its modern history, has been one of the great liberal-bulwark companies, the true home of the New York and L.A. media elite. Trump might have noticed, or surely will, that one of Zas\u2019s key lieutenants is Robert Gibbs, Obama\u2019s former press secretary. What\u2019s more, everyone on Zaslav\u2019s Zoom call is a liberal Democrat, with a required part of their conversation, after their close reading of the New York Times and the Washington Post, about the daily depredations of Donald Trump. Zaslav, a card-carrying G5 liberal, has sought, as everyone in his circle has, Manhattan cred \u2014 among other things, that has previously included prodigious support for Democrats. And now, as he and John Malone look to trade their way out of the tight spots of the business, they may need Donald Trump. WBD confirmed that a company representative recently reached out to the Trump orbit seeking advice about how the company might advantageously interact with the White House and improve its Trump-age odor. The reported message was to look at the example of Amazon and Jeff Bezos paying Melania Trump $40 million to participate in a documentary about herself. Don Jr. might like a hunting and fishing show on the Discovery Channel, they were told. And that CNN could have more pro-Trump voices \u2014 suggestion provided. Zaslav, who was notably photographed at the U.S. Open in September with Elon Musk , does not, to say the least, seem like a man for a moment that may require a face-off with this president. Zaslav\u2019s neutral, largely meaningless comments about CNN \u2014 \u201cThe most important thing to me \u2026 the metric that is most important to me \u2026 is how trusted is a brand is CNN \u2026 We believe in journalism \u2026 Journalism is fighting for the best version of the truth, as Carl Bernstein would say,\u201d invoking Christiane Amanpour and the tanks rolling into Moscow in 1991 \u2014 may seem to indicate that he is rightly not looking forward to that moment\u2019s coming. Which it will. One Great Story: A Nightly Newsletter for the Best of New York The one story you shouldn\u2019t miss today, selected by New York \u2019s editors.

The solution lies in external devices that unlock advanced features such as YouTube, Netflix, and app access through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto\u2014all without requiring a jailbreak. These devices offer a seamless way to enhance your in-car entertainment system while preserving your vehicle\u2019s original functionality. The video below from HotshotTek explores how these devices work, their features, and why they are a practical choice for upgrading your driving experience. Watch this video on YouTube . Understanding External Devices for In-Car Entertainment External devices designed for in-car entertainment come in two primary categories, each offering unique benefits: Android-based devices: These devices provide full Android functionality, allowing access to apps like YouTube, Netflix, and the Google Play Store directly on your car\u2019s infotainment screen. They essentially transform your car\u2019s system into a smart device. Wireless CarPlay adapters: These adapters are designed to convert wired CarPlay systems into wireless ones. In addition to eliminating the need for cables, they often include features like streaming capabilities and enhanced audio performance. Both types of devices are compatible with vehicles that support wired CarPlay, making them an accessible and cost-effective solution for drivers looking to expand their car\u2019s multimedia capabilities without replacing the head unit. Features and Benefits of External Devices These devices bring a wealth of functionality to your car\u2019s infotainment system, transforming it into a versatile multimedia hub. Key features include: Streaming access: Enjoy popular platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Apple Music directly from your car\u2019s display. App downloads: With Google Play Store support, you can install additional apps to suit your preferences. Connectivity options: Many devices offer built-in LTE connectivity via a SIM card or mobile hotspot, making sure uninterrupted streaming on the go. Cross-platform compatibility: These devices work seamlessly with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay systems, catering to a wide range of users. Mobile gaming support: While console streaming isn\u2019t available, some devices allow for casual gaming, adding another layer of entertainment. Whether you\u2019re embarking on a long road trip or navigating your daily commute, these features can significantly enhance your driving experience by providing entertainment and convenience. Preserving Your OEM System One of the standout advantages of these external devices is their ability to retain your car\u2019s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) system. Unlike aftermarket head units, which can be costly and may disrupt your car\u2019s settings, these devices integrate seamlessly with your existing setup. By keeping the OEM system intact, you benefit from: Preserved car settings: Features like climate controls, ambient lighting, and other factory settings remain unaffected. High-quality displays and audio: OEM systems often offer superior resolution and sound quality compared to aftermarket alternatives. Full compatibility: These devices work harmoniously with your car\u2019s built-in features, making sure a smooth user experience. This makes them particularly appealing for older vehicles, where replacing the head unit might not be practical or cost-effective. By opting for an external device, you can enjoy modern entertainment features without compromising your car\u2019s original design. Considerations and Limitations While these devices offer numerous advantages, it\u2019s important to be aware of their limitations to make an informed decision: Vehicle compatibility: These devices are only compatible with cars that support wired CarPlay, limiting their use in some models. Variable audio quality: The sound performance may differ depending on the specific device you choose, so research is essential. Data usage: Streaming relies on cellular data, which could lead to increased costs if not monitored carefully. Despite these challenges, the benefits of these devices often outweigh the drawbacks, especially for drivers seeking a cost-effective way to upgrade their car\u2019s entertainment system. Who Benefits the Most? These devices are particularly advantageous for specific groups of drivers, including: Owners of older vehicles: Drivers with older models, such as those equipped with Ford Sync 3 or earlier Kia systems, can modernize their infotainment experience without replacing the head unit. Road trip enthusiasts: Long journeys become more enjoyable with access to streaming platforms and other entertainment options. Audio-focused users: Those who prioritize sound quality can benefit from devices designed to enhance audio performance. If you fall into any of these categories, these devices can provide a significant upgrade to your in-car experience, making every drive more enjoyable and engaging. The Future of In-Car Entertainment The landscape of in-car entertainment is evolving rapidly. There is growing speculation that Apple and Google may eventually integrate streaming platforms like YouTube directly into CarPlay and Android Auto. Some automakers, including BMW, Tesla, and Mercedes, have already introduced built-in YouTube functionality in their infotainment systems. However, until these features become standard across all vehicles, external devices remain the most practical and accessible option for enhancing your car\u2019s entertainment capabilities without altering its original design. External devices offer a straightforward and effective way to unlock advanced features like YouTube and streaming apps on your car\u2019s infotainment system. By retaining your OEM setup, they provide a seamless and cost-efficient solution for improving in-car entertainment, particularly for older vehicles. Whether you\u2019re planning a road trip or simply looking to make your daily commute more enjoyable, these devices can transform your driving experience into something far more engaging and convenient.

Photo Tiffany Sage, BFA.com/National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution In Amy Sherald \u2019s unique visual language, muted yet commanding Black subjects are set against bold color fields. These eye-catching portraits reward longer looking. Her subjects, donning carefully selected garments, face audiences directly with quiet dignity, their skin painted in shades of gray. Sherald\u2019s elegant compositions celebrate various American visual traditions, from fashion spreads and clothing advertisements to historical painting from John Singer Sargent\u2019s intimate society portraits and Grant Wood\u2019s distinctly American regionalism to Kehinde Wiley\u2019s contemporary reframing of historical portraiture, though hers are refracted through a lens that subtly questions these traditions even as it engages them. Related Articles Fondation Louis Vuitton Makes a Big Splash with David Hockney's Largest Exhibition Ever Karyn Olivier's Elusive Art Bears Witness to Hidden Histories Bringing together some 40 portraits across nearly two decades of her career, Sherald\u2019s current survey at Whitney Museum in New York (through August 10) invites us to see how the artist, who rose to international acclaim after painting Michelle Obama in 2018, has reimagined portraiture while posing deeper questions about identity and American mythology. These tensions\u2014between beauty and complexity\u2014remind us that reimagining national identity requires not just new images, but new ways of seeing. Visitors will likely recognize Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (2018), the 6-foot-tall painting in which the former First Lady appears monumental yet approachable in her geometric patterned dress against a soft blue backdrop. While the Michelle Smith\u2013designed dress has been compared to Piet Mondrian\u2019s spare, primary-color compositions, Sherald has said that in the bold, patchwork-like geometry she sees echoes of the visual language of the Gee\u2019s Bend quilters, the cohort of Black women from rural Alabama whose work merges abstraction, utility, and ancestral memory. This overlooked reference subtly re-centers Black vernacular creativity as a foundational influence, challenging dominant narratives in fashion and design while anchoring the painting within a deeper, more nuanced cultural zeitgeist. The painting\u2019s loan from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., speaks to its significance, while its placement\u2014on its own wall facing a bench for contemplation\u2014in Sherald\u2019s retrospective reinforces how it simultaneously builds on the artist\u2019s earlier work and points toward to her more recent direction. Amy Sherald, They Call Me Redbone, but I\u2019d Rather Be Strawberry Shortcake , 2009. Photo Ryan Stevenson/\u00a9Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth/National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C. The exhibition, which debuted at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art last November, is organized chronologically and includes early works like Hangman (2007) and Well Prepared and Maladjusted (2008), which illustrate Sherald\u2019s style as she was developing it. In these formative pieces, we see the artist experimenting with her now signature technique of grayscaling skin tones, though with more tentative color relationships and less refined compositional strategies. The latter work, for example, highlights her emerging interest in how clothing communicates identity. The female subject, wearing a pink gingham shirt, her hair styled in a neat updo, stands against a muddy blue background overlaid in parts with a spongey pink cheetah print that forecasts the more assertive color juxtapositions of Sherald\u2019s later works. In They Call Me Redbone, but I\u2019d Rather Be Strawberry Shortcake (2009), the artist\u2019s visual approach has fully formed. Here, Sherald\u2019s take on clothing, color, and posture as they relate to identity lies front and center in this portrait of a woman in a yellow dress, her hands in her pockets and her head tilted inquisitively. The title, like many Sherald chooses, adds complexity to the calm visual presentation. Strawberry Shortcake asserts her chosen name, amplified by a strawberry pattern on the bodice of her dress and the nearly solid strawberry pink background. She dares you to call her Redbone. The portraitist\u2019s more recent large-scale paintings, on the other hand, demonstrate how her take on size and composition have evolved. In A Midsummer Afternoon Dream (2020), a woman in a blue dress stands beside a white bicycle, gently occupying the space in front of a bright green lawn with a white picket fence; the scene deliberately recalls, and then revises, mid-century American domestic ideals. At 8.8 by 8.4 feet, the work translates portraiture into its own environment entirely, immersing the viewer in Sherald\u2019s vision of Black leisure and belonging in spaces historically coded as white. Amy Sherald, A Midsummer Afternoon Dream , 2021. Photo Joseph Hyde/\u00a9Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth/Private Collection That depiction of a mid-century Americana that now includes Black people is further evident in a work from a year later, As American as apple pie (2021). In this double portrait, a couple stand in front of a yellow house and vintage car, the woman wearing a pink skirt and matching \u201cBarbie\u201d T-shirt, and the man in sand-colored chinos, a white T-shirt, and a vibrant denim jacket. Sherald\u2019s growing interest in subverting American iconography not only questions the historical exclusion of Black Americans but also aims to normalize Black presence within the visual canon through a restrained aesthetic. Even the title\u2019s reference to that classic dessert amplifies the narrative, inserting Black subjects into the visual language of American identity. A God Blessed Land (Empire of Dirt ), from 2022, similarly expands this purview, showing a Black man on a green John Deere tractor against a clear sky. The painting reconfigures American farming imagery, placing Black presence in the mythic landscape of American agriculture, a realm from which Black Americans have been systematically pushed out. That he stands atop this piece of machinery, as if further proof of his victory over the land, adds to this narrative of reclamation against a history of enslavement and forced manual labor. The subject\u2019s confident pose and direct gaze make viewers reconsider who belongs in this quintessentially American scene. Amy Sherald, A God Blessed Land (Empire of Dirt) , 2022, installation view, at Whitney Museum, 2025. Photo Tiffany Sage, BFA.com/\u00a9Amy Sherald Smaller works, like 2020\u2019s A bucket full of treasures (Papa gave me sunshine to put in my pockets\u2026) , show a more intimate side of Sherald\u2019s practice. The portrait depicts a young man in a white shirt embroidered with a yellow sun and red lobster; the pale-yellow background hinting at innocence and affection. The title suggests personal memory and family connection, themes that run throughout the exhibition but feel especially moving in the artist\u2019s depictions of children and young adults, like in Innocent You, Innocent Me (2016) of a teen boy holding an ice cream cone and wearing a camo Marvel T-shirt. It\u2019s worth noting that the exhibition title, \u201cAmerican Sublime,\u201d intentionally places Sherald\u2019s work both within and against art historical tradition. Sherald offers a different vision of sublimity from the overwhelming natural phenomena that inspire awe or terror that we are used to. Rather than vast landscapes or dramatic scenes, her sublime comes through in the daily experiences of ordinary people, their gazes steady and self-assured\u2014set against backgrounds so uniform they risk quieting the very individuality her portraits aim to elevate. This points to a significant reimagining of a concept that, in Western art history, has rarely centered the Black experience. Amy Sherald, What\u2019s precious inside of him does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence (All American) , 2017. Photo Joseph Hyde/\u00a9Amy Sherald/Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth/Private Collection, Courtesy Monique Meloche Gallery While Sherald\u2019s painting skill and compositional strength are evident, her aesthetic choices also raise important questions. Her signature rendering of Black skin in gray tones, meant to transcend racial categorization, creates a beautiful but potentially problematic distance. In removing the specificity of skin tone, Sherald risks aestheticizing Blackness in ways that might accidentally sanitize the lived realities of racial experience. The cool, composed manner of her subjects, while dignified, sometimes feels detached in ways that might unintentionally reinforce rather than challenge the flattening of Black identity. To this end, although Sherald\u2019s use of American visual motifs questions dominant narratives of national identity, her consistently calm, controlled visual interpretation sometimes works against the complex, varied nature of the Black American experience. Though visually striking, the artist\u2019s stately style at times contradicts what her work otherwise suggests: that Blackness and Black people aren\u2019t monolithic. The similar emotional tone across her portraits\u2014consistent across age, gender, or setting\u2014offers stunning coherence but occasionally limits her subjects\u2019 expressive range. That said, these tensions don\u2019t diminish Sherald\u2019s contribution; overall, they reflect the built-in challenges of making work that functions as celebration, critique, and revision of American visual culture all at once. In Sherald\u2019s hands, the American sublime is not found in the vastness of nature or the spectacle of power, but a space where individual humanity becomes transcendent.

And that\u2019s a\u2014 [ Music .] Yasmin Tayag: A perfect age. Brennan: A perfect age. My friends keep doing this bit that no matter how old I turn, they keep saying a perfect age for a woman , so it was like 27, the perfect age for a woman , and then I turned 28, the perfect age. Now once again, somehow I\u2019ve turned the perfect age for a woman. But I always remember thinking like, 28, for some reason, really stood out to me as the time that I thought I, like, thought a lot of my life would be together. And now that I\u2019m past that age, it\u2019s so funny to me to think that I thought that everything would magically be figured out at that time. But I find myself now just being like, 34 . Tayag: [ Laughs .] Brennan: It\u2019s gonna work out for me by 34 . Which I know, then I\u2019m gonna turn 34 and laugh at that and be like, what I thought was 34 is actually 42. Tayag: Well, I\u2019m 37, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s funny\u2014when I was a kid, I thought 37, you know, like my parents, I would have it all together. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Brennan: We\u2019re still just us at every single age. It\u2019s just going to be me at every age. Tayag: Yeah, but there\u2019s something comforting in that. To think that like, Oh, nobody really has it together at any age! They\u2019re all\u2014everyone\u2019s just figuring it out as they go along . Tayag: I\u2019m Yasmin Tayag, a staff writer with The Atlantic. Brennan: And I\u2019m Natalie Brennan, producer at The Atlantic. Tayag: This is How to Age Up . [ Music .] Brennan: I\u2019m very aware of the fact that 20s, 30s aren\u2019t the typical zone that people think of when they think of aging. [ Laughs. ] But we are all always aging, right? Tayag: We\u2019re always aging. Brennan: And at different life stages, some of us are thinking about it more than others. Like there\u2019s this big cultural hype around turning 30, and you know, I\u2019m a girl who spends a lot of time on the internet. And let me just say: The internet is not usually a space that promotes positive ideas of aging for young women. Tayag: Really? Brennan: Yeah, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m reporting it live. But I mean, I\u2019m thinking about even last year, the fashion trends revolved around bows; everything leaned very coquette in aesthetic. That in some ways \u2026 does promote an infantilization of women. Tayag: I totally agree, but I do actually think there\u2019s been a recent shift happening in terms of how we think about aging. You know, I wasn\u2019t excited about my 30s when I was growing up. Everyone I admired in pop culture was in their early 20s, max. And now, we\u2019re seeing celebrities who rose to fame in their 20s become even more sexy and powerful as they turn 30 or 40 or 50, like Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Alexa Chung, even Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 they\u2019re just owning their age, and they\u2019re modeling that getting older can still be sexy and powerful. Brennan: Extremely. Tayag: When I turned 30, the big thing I noticed was that, like, Oh, I like myself more. I\u2019m more comfortable in my skin. [ Music .] Brennan: And I\u2019m really grateful that in my personal life, I have so many amazing models of, yeah, people in my life who are in their 30s. Who just, yeah, seem to be more confident and more sure of themselves. Tayag: I hope I\u2019m one of those people. Brennan: One thousand percent one of those people. Tayag : Natalie, you know, as I\u2019m approaching my 40s I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how I\u2019m about to enter a new stage of life. So I can help you through 20s and 30s\u2014but I\u2019m looking for someone to help me through my 40s, and my 50s, and beyond! Brennan: And does that feel exciting, or does it feel scary? Tayag: Well, I\u2019m hoping to go into it with a positive mindset! Especially the perimenopause of it all. And someone, for me, who has really reframed what getting older can look like is Dr. Karen Adams. Dr. Adams is an ob-gyn, and she\u2019s the director of the Stanford Program in Menopause & Healthy Aging. [ Music .] Tayag: Dr. Adams, tell me how you describe your profession to someone at a cocktail party. Karen Adams: Well, I used to say that I deliver babies, but I don\u2019t do that anymore. And actually people are much more interested when I tell them that I was recruited about two years ago to create and lead a program in menopause and healthy aging. And people\u2019s eyes light up. I mean, everyone wants to age in a healthy way. And of course, you\u2019d have to be living under a rock to not know that menopause is having not even a moment\u2014it\u2019s a movement. People are very interested in perimenopause and menopause. Before I went to Stanford, I was in charge of training all of the OB-GYN residents at Oregon Health and Science University. And one of the requirements for the training was that they get trained in care of what was called then older women . And they were coming out of training really well, well-versed in delivering babies and operating and contraception and all these different things, but they actually weren\u2019t learning how to take care of women over 40. And so I established this clinic that we called the \u201cOver-40 Clinic\u201d; I\u2019m doing air quotes now. Now we know menopause can happen really at almost any age, through premature ovarian failure or insufficiency or early menopause. So it isn\u2019t really age dependent. It\u2019s been 20\u201325 years ago that I established that clinic, and it just became more and more my clinical focus. Tayag: It\u2019s shocking to hear how little focus there was in medical schools on menopause. And, like, if there\u2019s a knowledge deficit in doctors , it must be even greater culturally, just with the general public. Adams: It\u2019s one of the huge issues right now. That people with ovaries\u2014not everyone identifies as a woman , but I\u2019ll use that term as we\u2019re talking, simply because that\u2019s what the terms are in the research and such have been used\u2014but right, you know, that women are becoming much more educated about this sometimes than their providers are. There was a lot of fear around being on hormones 20 years ago because this big study came out and said, Wow, it increases the risk of heart attack and stroke and blood clots and breast cancer and all these thing s. And people freaked out, and everybody went off their hormones\u2014and we\u2019re still working to undo those messages. And medical students, residents, people who were in training for about 15 years didn\u2019t get taught about hormones or menopause, so there is some catching up to do. Tayag: Okay, so I want to come back to the specifics of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study on hormone therapy. But first I\u2019m hoping to talk to you more about the misconceptions about menopause on the whole that you\u2019re hearing these days? Adams: Oh, probably most often that it is the end of something. And that people feel mournful about the process, and they feel like it means their best years are behind them. And the reality is, there is a thing called menopausal zest . And it is a real thing. And I\u2019m here to tell you that your mother and your grandmother are pretty much having a good time. It\u2019s the transition that\u2019s hard. You know, perimenopause is hard, because you\u2019re going through a lot of changes, and what is your normal is now different. And so that transition is challenging. But oh my goodness\u2014once you get through it, women rate that they are happier at their work, in their relationships, with their partners, in their overall well-being, their feeling of knowing who they are and being comfortable with that. You know, what\u2019s funny is: Do you know the decade of life when people are the most unhappy? What age would you think that would be? Tayag: Fifties? Adams: Twenties. Tayag: Wow. Adams: Twenties. Teens and 20s. And then people get happier in their 30s and kind of early 40s, and then there\u2019s kind of a little dip\u2014late 40s to mid-50s, people kind of are struggling a little bit\u2014and then people just get happier and happier. Sixties, people are happier; 70s, people are even happier. So, you know, as long as you\u2019ve made the kind of choices that you want to make to really age in a healthy way. Now certainly, some of it is our genetics. Some of it, we have to play the cards we\u2019re dealt. But our lifestyle choices have so much impact on how healthy we are in our 70s and 80s. And there\u2019s a real correlation between our health with our overall happiness and well-being. Tayag: I mean, I\u2019m in my late 30s, and I\u2019m starting to come across quite a bit of menopause content on social media. But a lot of it still seems to focus on the negative stuff. Hot flushes and mood swings will happen. Brain fog, sleep challenges, anxiety. And, you know, that\u2019s the stuff people hear, and that gets all the attention. But what I would love to hear from you is: What is good about menopause that we\u2019re missing? Adams: It\u2019s really, really a part of the story that deserves a little more attention\u2014that it really is so wonderful in so many ways. And menopause literally is one day in your life. It\u2019s that day when you have not had a period for a year. And then, for the whole rest of your life, you are postmenopausal. But that doesn\u2019t happen like flipping a light switch, right? It\u2019s not like you just have your periods every month, and then all of a sudden they stop. So there\u2019s this period of time called the perimenopause , which is where things are changing, and your periods become less predictable and less regular. And then you begin to space them out, and then you start getting some symptoms. And eventually you\u2019ve had no period for a year. When your periods go away, all the symptoms associated with your periods go away. So, buh-bye PMS, buh-bye pelvic pain or cramping; some people get menstrual migraines. Endometriosis is another example of a condition that is very cyclic and very related to your monthly cycles. Once your periods are gone, those tend to go away. So that\u2019s a huge benefit that we don\u2019t talk about very much. You know, because your periods have gone away, you\u2019re not worried about getting pregnant, and people\u2019s sex lives often improve because they\u2019re just\u2014they just enjoy that freedom. Maybe you end up not needing to think about your diaphragm or your cervical cap, counting your cycles if you\u2019re doing natural family planning. It\u2019s just freeing to not be thinking so much about contraception. Tayag: So is it just that the symptoms of menstruation suddenly lift, and that\u2019s what leads to the menopausal zest? Or is there something more that\u2019s gained? Adams: It\u2019s just a time in a woman\u2019s life when there\u2019s some just stepping into your power: that sense of I know who I am . And I really had a lot of the experiences and life learnings that got me to this point. And hey, you know, I\u2019ve got half of my life still ahead of me. What am I gonna do with it now? My kids are almost raised; they\u2019re in college. It\u2019s great. You know, I can have sex in the kitchen if I want to\u2014which is what one of my friends said when I said, \u201cWell, your last kid\u2019s going to college. What are you gonna do?\u201d And she said, \u201cHave sex in the kitchen.\u201d Tayag: Amazing. Adams: And that is menopausal zest. Tayag: Hey, go wild. Adams: Why not, right? Sex is supposed to be adult play. It\u2019s supposed to be fun. It\u2019s not supposed to be a burden. You\u2019re not supposed to feel guilty that you\u2019re a crummy partner and you wish you wanted it and you don\u2019t. Sex is for us, as our own well-being. You release endorphins. You feel happier. Pain becomes less intense. It\u2019s a great way to manage pain. I talk to my patients about embracing themselves as a sexual being and trying to get back in touch with what I call your erotica menu. Everyone has an erotica menu of things they like, right? Some people like porn. Some people like a back rub. Some people like erotic literature. My point when I talk about that with my patients is: Remember who you are, remember what you like, and stop thinking so much about what you wish you were giving to your partner. Instead, ask for what you want. Think about what works for you. Now, I\u2019m not at all saying that someone can\u2019t have menopausal zest and have a thrilling, wonderful second half of your life and not be sexually active. That\u2019s fine. Some people are fine not having sex. I\u2019m not worried about anyone\u2019s sex life unless it\u2019s an issue for them. But the majority of my patients over age 70 are sexually active, and they are having sex with no difficulty, no pain, no problems. Tayag: That\u2019s so incredible. Adams: Mm-hmm. [ Music .] Brennan: Yasmin, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how our beliefs about aging are often tangled up with our beliefs about appearance. Tayag: I can say for myself\u2014those two things feel pretty intertwined. Brennan: And for me, too. And you know, we don\u2019t talk that much culturally about sex in older age maybe because we are just inundated with this problematic idea that, as you age, your sexual importance decreases. Like: I\u2019m even thinking about how beauty products are literally being marketed as \u201canti-aging,\u201d which perpetuates this false dichotomy between aging and desirability. Like you must not age so you can stay \u2026 desirable. Tayag: Right. I mean, the messaging right now is: How can you freeze your body in place for as long as possible to keep looking the same age forever? It reminds me of this story I wrote for The Atlantic about baby Botox. Brennan: Which, to clarify, is not babies getting Botox, but refers to the amount of Botox that people are getting, which is a baby dose. Tayag: Yes. Like, baby Botox is this idea that you start getting small doses of Botox early on, when you\u2019re very young and don\u2019t have any wrinkles, and you can kind of freeze yourself in place. When I was in college, my side gig was working in a doctor\u2019s office who did Botox. And I would see all of these moms come in with their teenage daughters in tow. The idea is that if you never move the muscles that give you wrinkles, you\u2019ll never get the wrinkles. Brennan: Right. Tayag: I wrote about this last year, and apparently the number of 20-somethings who got Botox or other injectables jumped 71 percent from 2019 to 2022. Brennan: That is a huge jump. Tayag: Yeah. And full stop\u2014if it works for you, amazing. That\u2019s your choice. But this conversation with Dr. Adams has had me thinking that when we try to freeze our bodies or faces or what have you in a particular period of time, what benefits are we missing out on? You know, are there benefits to looking older? I remember being in my 20s starting out in my first job, and, you know, just kind of being dismissed for looking so young and naive. I remember once an older man told me that he, like, looked at me and said, \u201cOne day when your face has more gravitas, you\u2019d make an excellent news anchor.\u201d Brennan: What? Tayag: Looking back, it was a weird thing to say. I wasn\u2019t offended at the time\u2014I had taken it as a compliment, he was saying that I was pretty enough to be in front of the camera someday. But now I can see how he also suggested I didn\u2019t look serious enough to deliver news, because I was pretty and young. Brennan: I \u2026 hate that. And unfortunately\u2014I think so many of us can relate to that, right? This sense that if you\u2019re young and attractive, you can\u2019t be a serious person. But once you become older and serious-looking, there\u2019s a flip side, that you aren\u2019t seen as attractive. And, of course, it can be very gendered\u2014young men aren\u2019t dismissed as easily. Tayag: Nope. Brennan: And I think it comes from women largely being seen as sexual objects, until they\u2019re not. Tayag: Right. On some level, I imagine it would be liberating to reach an age where we aren\u2019t being evaluated primarily for our looks. Brennan: But I don\u2019t know. It feels like you\u2019re either too sexualized, or you\u2019re not seen as a sexual being. I think both can feel really loaded. Tayag: Totally. And that tension is something that Dr. Adams and I spoke a lot about. [ Music .] Adams: It\u2019s so funny, right? We\u2019re either too young, or we\u2019re too old. If we have been valued for our appearance and our external attributes, it can be really challenging to age and to find that part of ourselves changing. And I think we have to avoid internalizing those messages; it\u2019s the work of a lifetime. And I remember being a young OB-GYN surgeon, and I went into the holding area to meet my patient that morning to see her, because we were getting ready to do her hysterectomy. And I met her husband for the first time, and we talked. And I said, \u201cOkay, this is what\u2019s going to happen. Do you have any more questions before we go back?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes. When are we going to meet the surgeon?\u201d And I said, \u201cThat would be me.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou, you\u2019re going to do the surgery?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And his wife was so embarrassed. She was like, \u201cOh, my gosh, I told you.\u201d Now, I like looking older because people think I know more, right? \u2019Cause I\u2019m a doctor. So it\u2019s like, you want your doctor to be experienced, and all of that. But boy, if I were an actress or if I were something where it\u2019s all about your physical appearance, that would be tough. But, I think all of the messages that we get have to be shifted a little bit. We should be working out to be strong, not to be thin. And focus on how the choices that you make will promote your physical and emotional well-being. And if we\u2019re lucky, we have parents that teach us to listen to ourselves and trust ourselves. And we learned that from an early age. I think we\u2019re teaching people more to trust themselves. And it\u2019ll be interesting to see how that changes the experience of aging for your kids, you know, because I think people are much more aware of the importance of that than we used to be. Tayag: After the break: Menopausal zest sounds awesome, but what about the symptoms so many women struggle with during the transition? [ Music .] Tayag: Dr. Adams, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the benefits of menopausal zest, but I\u2019m curious about the transition through. It is a transition, right? Adams: Oh, absolutely. It\u2019s really unmistakable, because it\u2019s physical. You know, there are physical changes happening. And so sometimes we go through emotional changes and transitions, but boy, menopause is a physical one. It is something that ushers in this new era of your life. But I think that one of the keys for menopausal quality of life is having good health care, so that you\u2019re not suffering with hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, mood disturbance, joint pain, brain fog, vaginal dryness. And that\u2019s one of my huge missions at Stanford, in our Program in Menopause & Healthy Aging, is teaching other providers how to take care of these folks, because a lot of people were not trained. Women deserve high-quality health care, and the state of the current situation is shameful. We can\u2019t blame people for not knowing things they were not taught. But it behooves those of us who do have that expertise to share it. And one of the best resources is through an organization called the Menopause Society, which is an organization that certifies menopause experts. So you can go on their website and put in your zip code, and a whole bunch of providers who have been certified in menopause will come up. And you can find someone in your area who can help you get through this, because this is not something you want to do without a road map. You need a road map. Tayag: Okay, so what does that road map actually look like? What are some practical things people can do to manage what they are going through? Adams: Right, right, right. Well, I can take people\u2019s hot flushes and night sweats away in about three weeks with some estrogen. So if that, if it\u2019s related to menopause, it\u2019s highly, highly, highly treatable. And the only people who shouldn\u2019t take estrogen are people who themselves have had a heart attack or a stroke, people who\u2019ve had breast cancer with certain types of hormone receptors, possibly people who\u2019ve had a blood clot in their leg or their lung or their brain, some types of hormone-sensitive cancers. But most people can be on hormone therapy, and that\u2019s estrogen\u2014and if you have a uterus, you\u2019re on progesterone as well. Night sweats are part of the reason that people have difficulty with sleeping, but some of it is because of anxieties. And so we talk to our patients about some techniques for mindfulness, for mindful breathing, some different things to help you get out of your head and be able to get back to sleep. There\u2019s a thing called cognitive behavior therapy that is the most beneficial for sleep disturbance and mood disturbance in menopause. And it can also decrease the bother of hot flushes. Everyone should do it. It is such a powerful tool for dealing with all the stresses of life. And so that\u2019s something I talk to all my menopausal patients about\u2014is find some cognitive behavior therapy resources. It will really, really help. Tayag: Okay, so I want to go back to hormone therapy, because there\u2019s still a lot of misunderstanding about what it can do and the risks involved. So what happened with the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, and what does it mean for the number of women on hormone treatment today? Adams: So less than 2 percent of people who are candidates for hormone therapy are actually on hormone therapy. Which is so awful. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative was the biggest trial in women\u2019s health, at that time, and I believe to date it was 165,000 women. And it\u2019s not that it was a bad study or that it was harmful. What the Women\u2019s Health Initiative did was, they enrolled people between the ages of 50 and 79 and started them all on hormones. They had not been on hormones before. And lo and behold, what we found is the people over 70 were the ones who had heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, etc. And the people between the ages of 50 and 60 actually had benefits. And now we have 20 years of follow-up data, and we found that those people have not died of heart disease more than people who were not on hormones, nor have we had increased numbers of deaths of breast cancer. So that is the part of the message that we really have to be clear on. When you\u2019re under 60 and you don\u2019t have any of those absolute contraindications, it\u2019s really a window of opportunity. And the risk of breast cancer with it is like eight extra cases per 10,000 women; the risk of breast cancer is greater with a sedentary lifestyle or alcohol intake more than one glass of wine a night, or being obese. And people worry so much about hormones when they don\u2019t even think about the fact that they\u2019re sedentary and they\u2019re overweight. Those are much bigger risks for breast cancer. So we do talk to folks now if they\u2019re under age 60 or less than 10 years out from menopause: They\u2019re going to get tremendous benefits being on hormones. And we\u2019re working hard to get that message out. Tayag: Are you worried at all that as people realize hormone therapy could be safe for them that there\u2019s a risk that it starts to be seen as a cure-all? We see that so often in the wellness space. Adams: We recognize we have so much control over our health, and that rather than looking for the answer in a supplement or some pill that you take\u2014although there are certainly value, values to taking pills, and I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t value to that\u2014but when people come to me, and they say, \u201cIf I go on hormones, will I prevent dementia? My mother had dementia. I don\u2019t want it. If I go on hormones, will it prevent me from getting dementia?\u201d I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d We know there\u2019s some benefit in the brain when people are on hormones. But we do know what decreases the risk of dementia. And it is: Don\u2019t smoke, minimize your alcohol intake, exercise, eat mostly plants. Manage any chronic health conditions you have, like high blood pressure, diabetes, things like that. And stay connected to your family and friends and your community. Brennan: Yas, you know, it\u2019s really amazing to hear this conversation about women embracing rather than defying aging, because so much of what we hear about right now in the longevity space is focused on trying to eradicate aging all together. And I do wonder if there is something about a very physical transition like menopause that almost forces women to reckon with aging\u2014like, you can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s happening to your body when it hits you all at once. It\u2019s not something you can compartmentalize or ration yourself out of. It\u2019s a part of your everyday. And maybe people who don\u2019t go through such a sudden shift miss out on that. Tayag: Yeah, I mean, men go through changes too, as they age. They experience things like a lack of energy, weight gain, sleep problems, sexual issues. And there\u2019s been some effort to classify these changes as menopause. The male version of menopause. But there\u2019s a lot of pushback on this idea, because it\u2019s just not the same thing. What men go through isn\u2019t caused by a sudden shift in hormone levels that leads to huge transformations in their bodies. It\u2019s not like their testosterone suddenly nose-dives the way estrogen does. It decreases a little, but very gradually over a long period of time. So, there may not be a moment or a life period that marks or reinforces aging in the same visceral way. Brennan: Right. I mean, I cannot see \u201cmanopause\u201d going over very well right now in the current cultural zeitgeist. But, regardless, I think one thing that might be important to remember right now is all of these internalized ideas that Dr. Adams has been talking about in regards to aging: They affect all of us. People of all genders. So recognizing them, unpacking them, working through them\u2014that\u2019s more of a call to everyone. [ Music .] Tayag: You know, throughout this conversation, I couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019ve said \u201cwe know now\u201d so many times\u2014which is amazing, because it means \u201cYes, we know now, menopause can be awesome.\u201d So why are we so stuck on this narrative? Adams: Why are we? And I have to tell you, I would rather be 66 as I am now than pregnant. No question. No question. I wouldn\u2019t be 35 again for anything. You\u2019re trying to figure out your career. You\u2019re trying to figure out your partner. You\u2019re trying to figure out where you\u2019re going to live. You\u2019re trying to figure out\u2014are you going to have kids? Where are you going to raise them? What are you going to do? There\u2019s so much going on in our 20s and 30s that is challenging and hard, and physically we\u2019re not getting much sleep, and we\u2019re trying to progress in our careers and all of that. It\u2019s challenging. And so much of that is resolved when you\u2019re in your 50s and 60s. It\u2019s so great. It\u2019s so great. Tayag: Dr. Adams, thank you for the absolutely enlightening conversation. I am excited to enter my next decade in a way that I wasn\u2019t before we talked. So thank you. Adams: I\u2019m so glad. I\u2019m so glad. Come on in. The water is fine. [ Music .] Tayag: Natalie, as you know, I just adored this conversation with Dr. Adams. Brennan: We are two huge fans. Tayag: And, you know, a thing I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about is that, intellectually, I understand the benefits of aging. I get that it can be great in all these ways. But emotionally, it\u2019s hard to undo all those assumptions. And I find it hard to trust that I, too, am going to feel as awesome as she does at that age. Brennan: Yeah; I really can relate to that. But we can\u2019t know how we are going to feel in this life stage that we\u2019re not in yet. What we do know is that we have this testimony and affirmation from older women who do know, and I do find that really comforting. Tayag: Right. Brennan: You know, there\u2019s this poem by Mary Ruefle that this conversation really reminds me of in this way of acknowledging from where you and I are at right now. We can\u2019t even yet really understand where we\u2019re gonna land, because we haven\u2019t gone through it yet. And maybe that persists throughout your life. I remember sending the poem to my mom around the time she was going through menopause, and we both really love it and keep coming back to it. Tayag: Hmm, that\u2019s really sweet. Brennan: And, you know, maybe it could be another point of reference for you too. I\u2019m going to read you the end of this poem. Tayag: I\u2019m going to cry. [ Laughs. ] Brennan: If you are young and you are reading this, perhaps you will understand the gleam in the eye of any woman who is sixty, seventy, eighty, or ninety: they cannot take you seriously (sorry) for you are just a girl to them, despite your babies and shoes and lovemaking and all of that. You are just a girl playing at life. You\u2019re just a girl on the edge of a great forest. You should be frightened but instead you are eating a lovely meal, you are cooking one, or you are running to the florist, or you are opening a box of flowers that has just arrived at your door, and none of these things are done in the great spirit that they will later be done in. You haven\u2019t even begun. You must pause first, the way one must pause before a great endeavor, if only to take a good breath. Happy old age is coming on bare feet. Bringing with it grace and gentle words and ways which grim youth have never known. [ Music. ] Tayag: That\u2019s all for this episode of How to Age Up .

Written by David Delima | Updated: 14 April 2025 14:20 IST Photo Credit: Meta Meta's Orion smart glasses prototype was unveiled in September 2024 Highlights Apple's CEO is reportedly focused on AR glasses development The firm is looking to beat Meta, which currently offers cheaper devices Apple has yet to officially reveal any plans to make a new AR wearable Advertisement Apple CEO Tim Cook has reportedly made the development of true augmented reality (AR) glasses a \"top priority\" for the company, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman writes in his weekly Power On newsletter. The company has yet to officially confirm plans to work on a pair of AR glasses, while rivals like Google, Meta, and Snapchat have showcased prototypes of smart glasses that resemble a pair of spectacles. Unlike larger (and heavier) mixed reality headsets, AR glasses require advanced technology that must be made affordable in order to appeal to customers. Apple Debating Whether to Allow AR Glasses to Capture Media Citing an source, Gurman states that Cook is focused on developing an \"industry-leading product\" before Meta, and has been spending a lot of time on the purported AR glasses. Meta has already showcased an AR glasses prototype dubbed 'Orion', and a commercial version of the device is expected to debut in the coming years. The Facebook parent firm currently offers the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which do not include an AR component that displays text and other information. However, these glasses allow users to capture images using a camera and microphone. According to Gurman, Apple has also been working on similar wearables, but it is \"actively debating\" whether the smart glasses should be allowed to capture media. Apple Reportedly Facing These Challenges While Developing Its AR Glasses While it's unclear whether Apple will launch camera-equipped spectacles like the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, previous reports indicate that the company is working on equipping other wearables with cameras \u2014 like the Apple Watch. If Apple is successful in developing true AR glasses, the company will have to compete with other firms like Google, Meta, and Snapchat. Last week, Google showed off an XR glasses prototype at TED 2025 that can scan text and offers a 'Memory' feature. It could debut as a Samsung product by next year. Snapchat Spectacles Get GPS-Powered AR Lenses, New Hand Tracking Features Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be in Development With This Notable Upgrade Apple Said to Stop Development of AR Glasses for Mac Computers Apple's AR Glasses to Come With New Version of visionOS: Report Meta also showcased a pair of smart glasses that is referred to as 'Orion', and the company is expected to launch a commercial version (codenamed Artemis) by 2027. Snap's fifth-generation AR glasses or Spectacles were unveiled in 2024 , but there's no word on when availability will be expanded from developers to customers.

[via press release from FOX Nation] FOX NATION TO DEBUT \"GREG GUTFELD'S WHAT DID I MISS?\" IN MAY Gutfeld Tests Contestants on Real Versus Fake Headlines from the First 90 Days of Trump Administration After a Three-Month Isolation Period NEW YORK - April 14, 2025 - Greg Gutfeld, host of the eponymous number one late night show Gutfeld! and co-host of cable's most-watched program The Five, will helm a three-part game show series for FOX Nation entitled \"Greg Gutfeld's What Did I Miss?\" The first of three episodes will drop on Monday, May 12th followed by episode two and three dropping on May 13th & 14th respectively. From January 20th through April 13th of this year, four contestants were in complete isolation in upstate New York, with no contact to the outside world - no phones, internet, television, or social media. Upon their return to society, the contestants compete in an epic showdown as they are tasked with figuring out what actually happened during their seclusion. Gutfeld will present dozens of scenarios, and the contestants must separate real headlines from fake ones. With a prize of $50,000 on the line, their instincts and senses of humor will be put to the test in front of a live audience and a panel featuring Gutfeld! regulars Kat Timpf and Jamie Lissow. In making the announcement, FOX Nation President Lauren Petterson said, \"Truth can be stranger than fiction and who better to help isolated Americans catch up on the headlines they missed during an unprecedented news cycle than Greg Gutfeld. We are excited for FOX Nation subscribers to have exclusive access to America's most-watched late night host's game show debut as he informs contestants about what really happened while they were completely off the grid and isolated from the outside world.\" Gutfeld added, \"For these four contestants to learn what really happened while they were living in isolation, they'll have to get through me first. Lucky them.\" Gutfeld! (10-11 PM/ET) just delivered its highest-rated quarter in the program's four-year history with 3.3 million viewers, 453,000 in the 25-54 demo and 287,000 in the 18-49 demo. The hit show outpaced all broadcast and late-night television, including CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, NBC's The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS' After Midnight and Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In addition to his late-night role, Gutfeld serves as co-host of cable's highest-rated program The Five (5-6 PM/ET) which averaged 4.6 million viewers in 1Q '25 and topped all programs on cable for the last 14 consecutive quarters. As one of the five original hosts when the program launched in 2011, Gutfeld and the ensemble, which includes Harold Ford Jr., Dana Perino, Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov and Jesse Watters, discuss news stories, controversies, and issues of the day in spirited and spontaneous format which has become appointment viewing on cable.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Everything You Need to Know", "content": "How Accurate Is iPhone Battery Health? - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer The accuracy of iPhone battery health metrics has become a topic of growing interest and concern among users and experts alike. Apple provides tools designed to help you monitor your battery\u2019s condition, but questions about the reliability of these metrics persist. If you rely on your iPhone for daily activities, understanding how battery health is measured and its implications is essential for maintaining your device\u2019s performance and longevity. The video below from iReviews gives us more details about iPhone battery health. Watch this video on YouTube . Are Battery Health Metrics Reliable? Apple\u2019s battery health feature, accessible through the settings menu, aims to provide a clear snapshot of your battery\u2019s condition. However, many users have reported discrepancies between the battery health percentage displayed and their device\u2019s actual performance. For instance, your iPhone might indicate a high battery health percentage, yet you could still experience slower performance, reduced efficiency, or even unexpected shutdowns. These inconsistencies can create confusion, leaving you uncertain about the true state of your battery. The reliability of these metrics is further complicated by the fact that battery health is influenced by multiple factors, such as usage patterns, environmental conditions, and the natural aging process of lithium-ion batteries. While Apple\u2019s system provides a general guideline, it may not always reflect the full picture of your battery\u2019s performance. Understanding Battery Cycles and Their Role A battery cycle is defined as one complete charge and discharge cycle, and Apple states that iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 cycles. This specification is intended to give you a benchmark for when your battery might start to degrade noticeably. However, some users have observed discrepancies between the reported cycle count and their device\u2019s actual performance. For example, your iPhone might report fewer cycles than expected for its age, yet still exhibit signs of reduced battery capacity, such as shorter usage times or slower responsiveness. These mismatches can make it challenging to determine when maintenance or replacement is necessary. Understanding battery cycles is crucial because they directly impact your device\u2019s ability to hold a charge and perform efficiently over time. How Battery Degradation Affects Performance As your battery health declines, particularly below the 80% threshold, you may begin to notice significant performance issues. These can include slower app loading times, reduced responsiveness, and even unexpected shutdowns during tasks that require higher power. While Apple\u2019s battery health feature is designed to warn you when your battery\u2019s capacity has diminished, these performance issues can sometimes occur even when the reported health percentage appears acceptable. For older devices, the combination of aging hardware and a deteriorating battery can exacerbate these problems. This can lead to a frustrating user experience, as your iPhone may struggle to keep up with everyday tasks. If you encounter these symptoms, replacing the battery is often the most effective way to restore your device\u2019s performance and extend its usability. Third-Party Monitoring Tools: Helpful or Misleading? To gain additional insights into their battery\u2019s condition, some users turn to third-party monitoring tools or shortcuts that analyze analytics data. These tools can provide information such as cycle counts, capacity estimates, and other metrics not readily available through Apple\u2019s settings. However, the data provided by these tools is not always consistent with Apple\u2019s metrics, leading to further confusion. For example, a third-party tool might report a lower battery capacity or a higher cycle count than what your iPhone displays. This lack of uniformity highlights the challenges of accurately assessing battery health, even with external tools. While these tools can be helpful in some cases, it\u2019s important to approach their results with caution and use them as supplementary information rather than definitive evidence. When Should You Replace Your Battery? If your iPhone\u2019s performance has noticeably declined and the battery health metrics seem unreliable, replacing the battery is often the best solution. A new battery can significantly improve your device\u2019s speed, responsiveness, and overall usability. Apple offers battery replacement services, but there are also third-party options available. When choosing a replacement service, it is crucial to ensure that the technician is qualified and uses genuine parts. Using counterfeit or low-quality batteries can lead to further issues, including safety risks and reduced performance. Replacing your battery at the right time can extend your iPhone\u2019s lifespan and help you avoid the need for a full device upgrade. How to Stay Ahead of Battery Issues To maintain your iPhone\u2019s performance and avoid unexpected battery-related problems, consider taking the following steps: Regularly monitor your battery health through the settings menu to stay informed about its condition. Pay attention to performance changes, such as slower app response times, shorter battery life, or unexpected shutdowns. Use third-party monitoring tools cautiously, as their data may not always align with Apple\u2019s metrics and could lead to confusion. Replace your battery when performance issues become significant, especially if your device is older or the battery health percentage drops below 80%. Adopt good charging habits, such as avoiding extreme temperatures and overcharging, to prolong your battery\u2019s lifespan. Why Understanding Battery Health Matters The accuracy and reliability of iPhone battery health metrics are critical for making sure your device remains functional and efficient. While Apple\u2019s tools provide a useful starting point, they are not without limitations. By staying informed about how battery health is measured, recognizing the signs of degradation, and taking proactive steps to address issues, you can maximize your iPhone\u2019s performance and longevity. Whether through regular monitoring, cautious use of third-party tools, or timely battery replacement, understanding battery health enables you to make informed decisions and keep your device running smoothly.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . The S&P 500 plunged over 10% before rebounding 9.5% after tariff changes. Despite volatility, financial advisors urge clients to stay calm and stick to investment plans. Advisors highlight tax-loss harvesting and IRA conversions as strategies during volatility. It's been a busy week and a half for financial advisors, as their clients' portfolios have seen historic moves. The S&P 500's 10.5% plunge from April 3 to 4 was among the steepest two-day drops ever recorded in market history. The skyrocketing comeback on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump lifted his excess tariffs for most countries, brought the largest point increases in a single session for the three major indexes. By Thursday, the selling had resumed in a big way. These ground-shaking market moves spooked investors into reaching out to their advisors, according to professionals in the industry who spoke to Business Insider. \"We are taking a lot of client phone calls, for sure,\" said Tyler Meyer, a certified financial planner and the founder of Retire to Abundance. Amid the volatility, the advisors said they are stressing to clients not to panic and to stick to a pre-decided plan \u2014 which will be different for each investor. Here are some other ways the money managers are guiding their clients through all of the mayhem. Communicating early A common theme was the importance of being available to clients \u2014 whether that means sending out email blasts or being responsive to calls. Chris Hernandez at Strategic Capital Powered by Waterloo said he's calling clients himself before they reach out. \"During times like this, we really try to be proactive versus reactive and send a lot of communications out via email,\" he said. \"For our clients that we know like higher touch points, we're just kind of calling them and reminding them of the strategies we put into place.\" Keeping an eye out for tax advantages A sell-off is a good opportunity to save money on taxes going forward, according to Tyler Meyer, the founder of Retire to Abundance. Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know He said he's been guiding clients through potential tax-loss-harvesting opportunities, for example. When an investor has a stock position that is down, they can sell it at a loss and discount that loss from their total taxable income the following year. After selling, they can buy the investment back after 30 days. A market correction could also be a good opportunity to convert a traditional IRA or a 401(k) \u2014 which are taxed upon withdrawals \u2014 to a Roth IRA. The latter is taxed up front instead of when withdrawals are made. When the market is down, the tax bill that results from the conversion would naturally be lower than it would when gains are at their highest. Explaining the macroeconomic landscape Bryan Kuderna, founder of Kuderna Financial Team, sent a letter to clients on April 4 providing an overview of the macroeconomic picture, including a lesson on tariffs, what the best and worst-case scenarios would be for investors, his personal outlook, and the risks of buying and selling in this market. \"My goal is to bring you up to speed, add some clarity during unclear times, and offer some peace of mind,\" he wrote in the letter. Reminding clients of prior downturns It can be easy to forget the feeling of panic that emerges during a slide in prices because there are often years between major sell-offs. \"People forget in good times how ugly and volatile things can get,\" said Melissa Cox, the owner of Future-Focused Wealth. But it's important to remember that the market eventually recovers, and sometimes quite quickly \u2014 which investors don't want to miss out on, said Chris Chen of Insight Financial Strategists. \"In 1987 it dropped 22%\" in a single day, he pointed out. \"And then it bounced back up immediately.\" He added: \"I think it's really dangerous to be out of the market right now.\" Taking profits and preserving clients' peace of mind Hernandez works with many Apple employees. As shares of the smartphone producer have gotten hammered by 23% thanks to tariffs, Hernandez has helped his clients execute a plan to sleep a little better at night. Many of his clients have built up a stockpile of shares in the company over many years, and he said some of them have decided to cut their positions by 15-20% to take a portion of their profits off the table. \"I always say money is both logical and emotional, so logically maybe they feel like they should hold onto the stock, but it's keeping them up at night,\" he said.

Five units will be put into service at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Terminal 1, ferrying customers from gate G1 at the main terminal building to gate C1 at the satellite terminal. The service complements the usual shuttle bus transfer and mirrors the one offered by Malaysia Airlines for its Business Class, utilising the Mercedes-Benz EQS500 and S580e to ply the same route. The shuttles are necessary because the airport\u2019s aerotrains are still in the midst of being replaced, having been delayed once again from the planned January completion date. It was last reported that the trains are due to begin service in the current quarter, per Malay Mail . \u201cTravel should be effortless, and at Batik Air, we believe our Business Class guests deserve nothing less,\u201d said Batik Air CEO Chandran Rama Muthy. \u201cThis VIP Transfer Service isn\u2019t just about moving between terminals\u2014it\u2019s about redefining the journey with innovation, care and a touch of exclusivity.\u201d Stellantis ASEAN managing director Isaac Yeo added: \u201cThe Leapmotor C10 redefines premium travel, delivering unparalleled comfort and sophistication for discerning passengers. This exceptional electric SUV embodies our vision for environmentally responsible mobility while offering a seamless and refined experience\u2014both on the road and beyond the airport tarmac.\u201d The C10 is the first local offering from Chinese brand Leapmotor, priced at RM159,700 on-the-road without insurance.

AI image: Midjourney/Cult of Mac After the U.S. government seemed to exempt iPhones, Macs and other electronics from hefty tariffs Friday, a clarification issued Sunday by President Donald Trump revealed that\u2019s not the case. Trump said on Truth Social that his administration did not announce a tariff exemption Friday. Instead, the \u201cexisting 20% Fentanyl Tariffs\u201d will still apply to electronics \u2014 with higher tariffs possibly coming soon. Nope, Trump did not exempt iPhones and Macs from reciprocal tariffs Since taking office, President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all major manufacturing countries with heavy import tariffs. True to his word, he announced a significant increase in import tariffs last week on goods imported from major Asian manufacturing hubs. The president eventually backtracked, suspending the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. China was the only exception, being hit with a hefty 145% tariff. Then, late Friday, the Trump administration announced what seemed like a tariff exemption for electronic items and semiconductors imported from China. However \u2014 as with so much of the craziness surrounding Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 that didn\u2019t last long. In a Sunday post on Truth Social , the president clarified that no country is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for its unfair trade practices. More importantly, he said his administration did not provide tariff exemptions Friday. Electronics, TVs, semiconductors and flash drives will continue to face a 20% tariff aimed at punishing countries Trump accuses of exporting the deadly drug fentanyl into the United States. The U.S. government is simply moving these products to a \u201cdifferent Tariff \u2018bucket,'\u201d Trump wrote. Providing further clarification, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government provided certain electronics items with only temporary exemptions. These items will become subject to \u201csemiconductor tariffs\u201d set to take effect within a month or two. \u201cAll those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they\u2019re going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\u201d Lutnick said Sunday on ABC News show This Week. \u201cWe need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can\u2019t be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\u201d Apple devices are safe from tariffs \u2026 for now For now, iPhones, Macs and other electronic devices remain safe from the 10% global tariffs implemented by Trump. However, this will change in the future as the U.S. government decides on a \u201cspecial focus\u201d tariff for semiconductors. Apple reportedly stockpiled iPhones before implementation of the proposed tariffs , which would have gone into effect last week. It could do the same over the next one or two months as the Trump administration finalizes its new semiconductor tariff.

Learn more. Mobile The first foldable iPhone could copy a polarizing Samsung feature Do you want an under-display camera on the foldable iPhone? Well, Apple is apparently going ahead anyway. By Hadlee Simons \u2022 Published on April 14, 2025 \u2022 0 \u2022 Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority TL;DR Apple\u2019s foldable iPhone will apparently have an under-display camera on the folding screen. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices have offered this feature since 2021. This camera is nearly invisible but has noticeably inferior image quality compared to a conventional selfie camera. Apple is widely tipped to launch its first foldable iPhone next year, and we\u2019ve already seen a few rumors about this device. Now, it sounds like this new foldable phone could adopt a rather interesting camera borrowed from Samsung. Frequent tipster Digital Chat Station has claimed on Weibo that Apple\u2019s upcoming foldable phone will feature an under-display selfie camera on the folding screen. Meanwhile, the cover display is said to have a camera in a cutout. Weibo/Digital Chat Station In other words, Apple would be copying Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices by adopting an under-display selfie camera for the folding display. 2021\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 3 was the first foldable with this camera and last year\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 6 maintained this feature. Under-display cameras hide under the screen and are nearly invisible, making for a more immersive screen viewing experience. However, these cameras have poor image quality compared to conventional selfie cameras. This is because the display blocks a lot of light from hitting the camera sensor. So you really shouldn\u2019t expect this camera to take great photos on Apple\u2019s foldable. For what it\u2019s worth, we thought the under-display shooter on the Z Fold 6 was only good for video calls and that the cover display camera was better. Digital Chat Station reiterated that the foldable iPhone will have a 7.76-inch folding screen and a 5.49-inch cover display. However, they also revealed that the folding screen would have a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution while the cover display is poised to have a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution. Either way, it sounds like Apple is adopting a squat form factor like the original Pixel Fold and OPPO Find N2 rather than the tall and narrow form factor adopted by Samsung. Got a tip? Talk to us!

This report looks at the different procurement methods companies can use when adopting renewable energy. Over 400 of the world's largest companies have committed to transition fully to renewable electricity, with 278 of these aiming to achieve their target on or before 2030. There are multiple ways companies can buy renewable energy. Each comes with its own challenges, and some can leave corporate buyers open to accusations of greenwashing. Key Highlights On-site generation is the most robust procurement method but has extremely high upfront costs. On-site generation refers to producing energy at the site where it will be consumed. This is an expensive procurement method, as it has high upfront and maintenance costs, but it guarantees 100% renewable energy (RE100) for a company's facilities. This method is best suited for companies with a low number of facilities or large corporations with the capital to invest in new power plants. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming more popular. PPAs are long-term contracts between a clean electricity generator and a customer. PPAs may last up to 25 years, during which time the buyer purchases energy at a pre-negotiated price. High credit requirements make PPAs most appropriate for companies that can guarantee continuous energy demand over a long period of time. Supply contracts are the more suitable option for smaller enterprises without the opportunity for on-site generation. This report analyzes renewable energy procurement methods, including on-site renewable generation, power purchase agreements (PPAs), supply contracts, and energy attribute certificates (EACs).It also evaluates the main challenges to renewable energy procurement, including oversupply, price pressures, and skyrocketing demand. Understand why companies need to adopt renewable energy. Access the different methods of renewable energy procurement. Identify which energy procurement method is most appropriate for your company.

Upon arrival at a selected petrol station, the car automatically detects it. The driver can then enter the pump number and verify the gasoline station by launching the app on the car's screen.

Washington, United States: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining the market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Home News You are here The one to take on the Galaxy S26 and iPhone 18 will probably pack a 7,000 mAh battery By Sebastian Pier Published: Apr 14, 2025, 3:09 AM 0 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Apple Xiaomi Galaxy S Series iPhone Up Next: The Galaxy S25 and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro for reference. | Image credit \u2013 PhoneArena Come 2026, the phone industry will meet the Galaxy S26 and the iPhone 18 \u2013 unless both Samsung and Apple go with different monikers \u2013 and these two flagships will have to deal with a phone that could arrive with a mind-boggling battery. It's the Xiaomi 16 that is rumored to pack a 7,000 mAh battery next year, when it materializes. The popular Weibo (a large Chinese social media platform) tipster by the nickname of Smart Pikachu is the one who predicts it: Image source \u2013 Weibo In these current times of ours, rumors about a phone with such a massive battery is certainly not that much of a surprise. After all, Honor might be unveiling a handset with a massive 8,000 mAh capacity cell under the hood. We're now entering Android's Big Battery Era , as my colleague Alan underscored the other day. Some tipsters say Android flagships from the recent future could reach battery capacities of up to 7,500 mAh. The Red Magic 10 Pro, for example, already features a 7,050 mAh battery, and rumors suggest the OnePlus 14 may come with a 7000 mAh battery (the OnePlus 13 has a 6,000 mAh cell). Receive the latest Samsung news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . What's notable about the possibility of the Xiaomi 16 to pack a 7,000 mAh battery is that the phone could be \"compact\", at least in the flagship category\u2026 and if Xiaomi keeps the dimensions of the Xiaomi 15 , a 6.36-inch phone. Battery technology advancements are super cool: it's not just owners of tile-sized phones that can enjoy superb battery life. Those among us who cherish compact devices will not be left behind, and this is the kind of news that gives a nice start to the week. Xiaomi 16 is still too ahead in time to be discussed in detail, but we're about to meet another compact flagship with a massive battery real soon: the OnePlus 13T. This flagship killer is expected to launch with a 6,200 mAh battery (for reference, the Galaxy S25 Ultra packs a 5,000 mAh capacity cell) and the maxed-out Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It's also rumored to be under 189 grams, thanks to its \"Glacier battery\", developed with battery giant CATL a year ago. Designed to stay cool under pressure, the cell technology helps improve both battery life and performance. Compact phones often overheat during gaming while charging, leading to a poor experience, so keeping the battery cool is crucial. Did you enjoy reading this article?

However, it seems that there is a slight twist, and the tax relief will only be short-lived. According to the Trump administration, the 125 percent reciprocal tariff relief is only temporary, and the taxes will continue to be applied to smartphones, laptops, and more in the coming \"month or two.\" Apple's exemption from the 'reciprocal' tariff is only temporary, as the Trump administration will announce a new solution in a month or two We have previously reported that US Customs and Border Protection published exclusions from the list of imports that are bound to follow Trump's new 125 percent reciprocal tariff on China along with the base 10 percent global tariff. As mentioned, the exclusions revolved around \u201csmartphones, laptop computers, hard drives, computer processors, and memory chips.\u201d Related Story Apple Uses New Tech That Compares Synthetic Data With Real Emails To Train AI Models, Then Applies Embeddings And Privacy Tools To Improve Text Output Quality Apple would have adhered to a total tariff of 145 percent, which includes the 125 percent reciprocal tax and 20 percent fentanyl tax, which President Trump emphasized in a post on Truth Social today. Currently, it is capped at 20 percent, and based on the information, the relaxation is temporary as the exemption from the reciprocal tariff is not a \"permanent sort of exemption,\" according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik. Lutnik stated in an interview with ABC News that the tech sector would receive a \"special focus type of tariff \" (via The Verge ), emphasizing that the social tariff would include products like the iPhone. President Donald Trump's remarks on Truth Social were quite similar, as he also claimed that the administration would take a closer look at semiconductors and the \"whole electronics supply chain\" in the forthcoming tariff investigation. We can safely presume that the Trump administration would announce a special tax for the tech industry at a later date, possibly in a month or two, as per the officials. The tariff could be less than the current 125 percent reciprocal tax but could be higher than it was before. For Apple, it means that reliance on China for components and semiconductors would no longer be a long-term solution, as it would seek imports from India and Vietnam. The company could also ramp up its investments in the regions and compel its suppliers to do the same as well. Currently, Apple does manufacture its products in Vietnam, which includes the new M4 MacBook Air and M3 Ultra Mac Studio, but the supply is quite limited compared to China's vast manufacturing facilities. We will keep you posted on the latest, so do stick around for more details.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that smartphones, computer monitors, and various electronic components are among the exempted items. This means Apple has dodged another bullet \u2014 again. This news is clearly good for Apple and for us as customers in the short term. However, it\u2019s also a flashing red warning for the future. Apple currently assembles over 90% of its iPhones in China. That represents an enormous concentration of risk in one country. That\u2019s too much for any company, and certainly too much for a company shipping hundreds of millions of devices annually to customers worldwide. I fully acknowledge that moving iPhone manufacturing out of China isn\u2019t as simple as flipping a switch. Apple has spent decades meticulously building that supply chain, a masterpiece of logistics and precision manufacturing. But global trade dynamics are evolving rapidly, and Apple can\u2019t afford to stand still. This isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about resilience. Apple has executed Herculean efforts before. Now is another moment when they must rise to the occasion. Diversifying their manufacturing base might be the single most critical long-term move they can make right now. (That sentence was difficult to write because I also believe they need to fix their Siri/AI issues.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201c How People Pay: Budgeting Anxiety Drives Debit Card Usage \u201d shed light on the nuanced decision making behind payment method selection in brick-and-mortar stores and across digital channels. The report, a comprehensive survey of 2,552 U.S. consumers conducted in August, uncovered a fundamental tension between consumers seeking to manage their spending and those prioritizing financial incentives. This dichotomy played out differently depending on the shopping environment. For in-store purchases, debit cards and cash were favored by those focused on budgeting and convenience, with 14% of debit card users and 20% of cash users citing budget management as a key reason for their choice. Conversely, credit card use in-store was predominantly driven by the desire for rewards or cash back, cited by 40% of users. Security concerns also factored into in-store choices, with cash being the preferred method for consumers prioritizing payment security. The online landscape presented a slightly different picture, although the underlying themes of budgeting and incentives persisted. Budget-minded online shoppers gravitated toward debit cards, with roughly a quarter highlighting the ease of tracking payments and 14% emphasizing budget control. Security became a more prominent factor in online transactions, with 8.3% of credit card users citing better security compared to 4.8% of debit card users. Despite this, the primary driver for online credit card use remained rewards, attracting one-third of users. Digital wallets emerged as a strong contender for online convenience, with 55% of users citing them as their main reason, higher than debit or credit cards. Trust in the provider played a larger role for PayPal users compared to those using Google Pay or Apple Pay . Other key findings from the report: Forty percent of consumers using credit cards in-store were motivated by rewards or cash back. This highlighted the continued power of incentive programs in driving credit card adoption for physical purchases. Convenience was the top motivator for online debit card use, cited by 44% of users. This underscored the importance of seamless transaction experiences in the digital realm for debit card holders. Fifty-five percent of online digital wallet users prioritized convenience. This demonstrated the growing appeal of digital wallets for their ease and efficiency in eCommerce . Beyond these key takeaways, the report delved into other compelling aspects of consumer payment behavior. For instance, it explored the motivations behind digital wallet use in physical stores, where convenience was also the leading factor, albeit by a smaller margin compared to online transactions. The report also differentiated between various digital wallet providers, noting the importance of brand trust for PayPal users.

By learning how to optimize these features, you can maximize your device\u2019s efficiency, extend its lifespan, and ensure a smoother user experience. In the video below, iReviews explores ten common mistakes and provides actionable tips to help you make the most of your iPhone. Watch this video on YouTube . 1. Misusing the App Switcher Many users believe that frequently closing apps in the app switcher conserves battery life, but this practice can have the opposite effect. When you force-close an app, your iPhone must reload it entirely the next time you open it, consuming more energy and system resources. Instead, allow iOS to manage background apps automatically\u2014it is designed to optimize memory and battery usage efficiently. Trusting the system to handle this process can improve your device\u2019s overall performance and reduce unnecessary strain. 2. Overusing Wireless Charging Wireless charging offers unparalleled convenience, but excessive reliance on it can lead to overheating, which gradually degrades your iPhone\u2019s battery health. To mitigate this, alternate between wireless and wired charging methods. Additionally, ensure your wireless charging pad is certified and placed in a well-ventilated area to prevent heat buildup. By taking these precautions, you can maintain your battery\u2019s longevity and avoid unnecessary wear. 3. Allowing Heat Exposure Heat is one of the most significant threats to your iPhone\u2019s internal components. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures\u2014such as leaving your device in direct sunlight or using bulky cases during intensive tasks like gaming or charging\u2014can cause permanent damage. If your iPhone feels hot, remove the case and allow it to cool naturally. Avoid placing your device in environments prone to extreme heat, such as car dashboards or outdoor surfaces, to protect its hardware and performance. 4. Mismanaging Location Services Location services are essential for apps like navigation and weather, but leaving them enabled for all apps can drain your battery and compromise your privacy. To optimize this feature, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Location Services and enable it only for apps that genuinely require it. Whenever possible, select the \u201cWhile Using the App\u201d option to limit unnecessary tracking. This simple adjustment can significantly improve battery life and enhance your privacy. 5. Ignoring Auto-Lock Settings Failing to configure the auto-lock feature can lead to unnecessary battery drain and increase the risk of unauthorized access to your device. To safeguard your iPhone, set it to lock automatically after a short period of inactivity. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and choose a one- or two-minute interval. This setting not only conserves energy but also enhances the security of your personal data. 6. Leaving AirDrop Always On AirDrop is a convenient tool for sharing files, but keeping it enabled at all times can drain your battery and expose your device to potential security vulnerabilities. When not in use, disable AirDrop by swiping down to access the Control Center, tapping AirDrop, and selecting \u201cReceiving Off.\u201d Enable it only when you need to transfer files. This small habit can improve battery efficiency and reduce the risk of unauthorized file sharing. 7. Using Cellular Data Instead of Wi-Fi Relying on cellular data instead of Wi-Fi consumes significantly more battery power. Whenever possible, connect to a secure Wi-Fi network to reduce energy usage and improve connection stability. Additionally, you can disable cellular data for apps that don\u2019t require it by going to Settings > Cellular and toggling off unnecessary apps. This not only conserves battery life but also helps you manage your data usage more effectively. 8. Overloading iCloud Storage iCloud is a powerful tool for syncing and backing up data, but allowing too many apps to access it can result in excessive background activity and storage issues. To manage this, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud and review which apps have access. Disable iCloud syncing for apps that don\u2019t need it to free up storage space and reduce unnecessary activity. This ensures your iPhone operates more efficiently while keeping your cloud storage organized. 9. Skipping Software Updates Outdated software can leave your iPhone vulnerable to bugs, glitches, and security threats. Regular updates not only fix these issues but also introduce new features and performance improvements. To streamline this process, enable automatic updates by going to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates. Keeping your device up-to-date ensures it remains secure and operates at peak efficiency without requiring constant manual intervention. 10. Neglecting Regular Reboots Restarting your iPhone periodically can refresh system processes, resolve minor glitches, and enhance overall performance. This simple habit ensures smoother operation and helps your device run more efficiently. To reboot your iPhone, press and hold the power button, then follow the on-screen instructions. Incorporating this practice into your routine can prevent small issues from escalating and keep your device running optimally. By addressing these common mistakes, you can significantly improve your iPhone\u2019s performance, battery life, and security. Small adjustments\u2014such as managing location services, alternating charging methods, and rebooting regularly\u2014can make a noticeable difference in how efficiently your device operates. Take control of your iPhone\u2019s features today to enjoy a more reliable and seamless user experience.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Zak Doffman writes about security, surveillance and privacy. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 03:54am EDT Share Save Comment All change for Gmail. NurPhoto via Getty Images Interesting times for Gmail. Google has confirmed that its two new headline upgrades don\u2019t actually work together, raising awkward questions for its 3 billion users. And so all those users now must grapple with a new upgrade decision, one with major implications for the future direction of the platform and for what Google does next. We\u2019re talking AI, security and privacy. The two upgrades that clash are a kind of quasi end-to-end encryption and an AI-fueled search alternative that promises a markedly different quality of results. Unfortunately, Google can\u2019t see your fully encrypted emails (rightly so), and must exclude those emails from its AI search results. This will not be a one-off situation. Cloud-based AI features and device-based security do not work well together, leaving users with some tough decisions to make. Apple had seemed to resolve this with its Private Cloud Compute, but then its disastrous Apple Intelligence delays made all that somewhat academic for the time being at least. Forbes Google\u2019s Messages Update Just Made Android More Like iPhone By Zak Doffman Newsweek has now neatly framed the decision facing Gmail users: \u201cAllow Gmail to use AI-driven tools by enabling \u2018smart features\u2019 and data sharing, [or] MORE FOR YOU Netflix\u2019s Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic Score Fed Official Confirms Trump Tariff Bailout Is Ready Amid $30 Trillion Market \u2018Panic\u2019 Warning Gmail And Microsoft 2FA Security Bypass \u2014 Take Action Now, Users Told decline the use of AI tools, which limits certain features but offers stronger data privacy.\u201d But this isn\u2019t a simple yes or no. Gmail and other email platforms are driving towards an AI future and it won\u2019t be that easy to disable all the AI settings. Remember, Google has access to all your content anyway in its cloud servers. The only real opt-out (bar changing a bunch of admin settings) is to fully secure your emails. And on that, the caveats and qualifiers around Gmail\u2019s end-to-end encryption highlight how difficult a medium email is to fully secure. Even with Advanced Data Protection enabled, Apple Mail is one of the only exceptions to what can be end-to-end encrypted on iPhone. As Apple explains, \u201ciCloud Mail does not use end-to-end encryption because of the need to interoperate with the global email system,\u201d albeit \u201call native Apple email clients support optional S/MIME for message encryption.\u201d Beyond email, this new AI decision is not specific to Gmail. You will see variations from multiple other platforms in the coming months. WhatsApp\u2019s new Advanced Chat Privacy stops users exporting entire chats or saving media to their phone gallery \u2014 easily bypassed of course, but also stops engagement with Meta AI within a chat. Ask yourself why. Again, new AI updates and security and privacy don\u2019t work well together. Forbes U.S. iPhone, Android Users At Risk From New Chinese Attacks By Zak Doffman Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u201c will now remember your old conversations ,\u201d which sounds great until you consider the privacy implications of all that personal data being stored in a readily accessible way. In all likelihood nothing has changed from a data standpoint, except the optics. But even as Sam Altman posted his excitement at \u201cAI systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized,\u201d the move unsurprisingly \u201c sparked privacy concerns .\u201d Users can choose to opt out of ChatGPT\u2019s update, but just as with Gmail, there is no sensible level of user education and understanding. What are the risks and trade-offs? What happens to your data and how is it secured and safeguarded? Is there even a common syntax to explain this choice across platforms? Specifically on Gmail \u2014 yes, you must decide whether you want AI marauding across your data, but you also need to be clear on the pros and cons of email itself. It\u2019s not a fully secure platform and is open to malware, phishing and spam. All of that will also get worse as the trickle of AI attacks becomes a tidal wave. In reality, there\u2019s a much larger rethink required. My recommendation is to keep all that in mind as you decide. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

The US President, 78, has put tariffs up to 145 percent on Chinese goods whilst announcing a 90-day tariff pause for most other countries. This includes a 10 percent baseline on most imports. And then just last week (11 April), the US Customs and Border Protection looked to have revealed a long list of tech products that would be exempt from tariffs. This included products like smartphones, laptops and TVs. Advert Tariff exemptions would have been welcomed by tech firms, such as Apple , who rely on China to manufacture a reported 80 percent of its products and 90 percent of their iPhones . When talking to ABC News, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said such exemptions would only be temporary as they would be part of the tariffs yet to come 'in a month or two'. However, Trump insisted last night (13 April) that 'nobody is getting off the hook' with tariff exemptions. Taking to his social media platform, Truth Social, he wrote in a lengthy post that 'NOBODY is getting 'off the hook' for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!' Advert He explained that 'there was no tariff exception announced on Friday', as the products were 'just moving to a different Tariff bucket'. \"The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,\" Trump added. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. Donald Trump insisted that 'nobody is getting off the hook' with tariff exemptions (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) \"What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. Advert \"We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!\" The businessman promised to provide 'more and better paying jobs, making products in our nation, and treating other countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.' This comes after Trump was asked in a press conference if he would consider putting the tariffs up if a deal wasn't met with other countries. Trump has issued somewhat of a u-turn (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) \"Well, that's what would happen,\" he said. \"I mean, if we can't make the deal that we want to make or we have to make or that's good for both parties - and it's got to be good for both parties - then we go back to where we were. Advert \"We'll have to see what happens at that time.\" Meanwhile, China has raised tariffs on US goods to 125 percent after Chinese president Xi Jinping warned that 'there are no winners in a tariff war'. During a recent broadcast, he said: \u201cFor more than 70 years, China has always relied on itself and hard work for development, never relying on favours from anyone, and not fearing any unreasonable suppression.\u201d Featured Image Credit: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Topics: Politics , Donald Trump Anish Vij Anish is a Journalist at LADbible Group and is a GG2 Young Journalist of the Year 2025.

They have carefully enriched the digital experience, contributing to multi-billion dollar success. Thousands of banks and Fintechs try to tap into the same principles. In this article, we\u2019ll uncover 13 iconic UX innovations from the world\u2019s top tech giants\u2014and show you exactly how to adapt these brilliant insights for financial services. Because if a single tap can revolutionize e-commerce, just think what it could do for your financial brand. Let\u2019s dive in. Of course, the rise of AI is transforming the world and the way we interact with digital services, making its integration into future banking solutions all but inevitable. Yet, many banks and financial institutions still haven\u2019t adopted the very digital innovations that have already proven their worth in the world\u2019s largest tech companies. You will likely recognize the 13 user experience (UX) innovations featured in this article; most of us use them daily. These innovations were central to the success of multi-billion-dollar tech corporations\u2014yet they\u2019re surprisingly underutilized in financial services. How can banks and Fintechs leverage these proven UX strategies to transform generic copycut products into unique experiences that increase user engagement, build trust and increase key business metrics? Historically, the banking industry has struggled with a reputation for complexity and formality. However, today\u2019s consumers expect the same frictionless and rich experiences they enjoy in e-commerce and digital entertainment. Advanced banks and Fintechs are discovering that even small design tweaks can translate into major gains in customer satisfaction and revenue. Applying 13 Iconic UX Innovations to Financial Services Below are 13 widely cited examples of interface adjustments\u2014such as refining a single button or streamlining the onboarding process\u2014that drove significant improvements in both business outcomes and user experience. While they may appear modest, these best practices solve pressing user needs and have already become the standard across digital products in multiple industries. At UXDA we refer to this with our \u201cdopamine banking\u201d approach: using UX design to create micro-rewards and positive emotional triggers that keep users engaged, satisfied and returning to digital financial service. The core idea is that seemingly minor updates to enrich user experience can deliver remarkable returns in customer adoption, engagement and gained revenue. Dopamine, frequently called the \u201cfeel-good\u201d neurotransmitter, is released when users perceive rewards or positive outcomes. By aligning UX choices with these reward mechanisms, financial institutions can guide user behavior while raising overall satisfaction. Because these UX techniques have gained amazing results in the world's top digital services, a lack of them can place your product at a competitive disadvantage. Let\u2019s explore how these small but powerful interface design enhancements can generate unexpectedly large benefits for financial services: 1. One-Tap Actions Example: Amazon\u2019s \u201cOne-Click\u201d Checkout Instead of requiring users to fill in shipping and payment details repeatedly, Amazon introduced a single-click purchase flow once the user\u2019s information was saved. Drastically reduced cart abandonment by removing friction. Demonstrated how investing in a single, streamlined flow could transform the entire experience. \u201cOne-Click\u201d became one of Amazon\u2019s competitive advantages, credited with boosting conversion and recurring orders. Why It Matters: Eliminates friction: Streamlined workflows for common banking transactions (e.g., paying bills or sending peer-to-peer transfers) reduce dropout rates. Boosts engagement: Customers who see banking as fast and convenient are more likely to open and use the app frequently. Creates loyalty: By removing repetitive tasks, banks can delight users with near-instant, secure transactions. Implementation Tips: After user identity verification (via Face ID or a PIN), provide a single-button action: \u201cPay This Bill\u201d or \u201cSend $50 to John.\u201d Offer a short confirmation step for high-value transactions to reassure users. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Gratification: When users pay a bill or send money with a single tap, they receive immediate feedback (\u201cPayment successful!\u201d), which provides a quick sense of accomplishment. That momentary success can release dopamine as the brain recognizes a goal was achieved with minimal effort. Reduced Friction: Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for friction, which can dampen positive emotion. The simpler the flow, the clearer the reward path. Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and in control because they accomplished a meaningful task (paying a bill, making a transfer) with little friction. This positive emotional signal can reinforce future usage. 2. Minimalist First Screen Example: Google Search\u2019s Simplified Homepage From the earliest days, Google maintained a minimalist homepage, focusing on a single search bar and little else. Over the years, they\u2019ve retained that simplicity, carefully avoiding clutter. The clean, simple interface helped users find what they needed faster, becoming a hallmark of Google\u2019s brand. Lightning-quick load times enhanced user satisfaction, keeping Google as the world\u2019s leading search engine. This design choice arguably paved the way for \u201cless is more\u201d in modern UI design. Why It Matters: Reduces cognitive load: Users can find critical information (e.g., balances, upcoming payments) at a glance. Improves speed and learning curve: A clean screen with fewer elements typically loads faster, which boosts app performance ratings and is more intuitive for newcomers. Enhances brand clarity: Simple design conveys confidence and modernity, often associated with trust and authority. Implementation Tips: Make the landing screen highly focused: show only key balances, upcoming payments and a primary action (e.g., \u201cSend Money\u201d or \u201cPay Bill\u201d). Hide or tuck away secondary features, ensuring the main page remains uncluttered. Dopamine Trigger: Visual Clarity and Calm: Overly cluttered dashboards can trigger anxiety and reduce attention, blocking the potential release of dopamine associated with navigating something clear and intuitive. Sense of Mastery: A minimalist dashboard that focuses on top tasks gives users a sense that they know exactly where to go\u2014mastery itself can be rewarding and can produce small dopamine hits. Emotional Effect: Users feel relieved and confident rather than overwhelmed. This sense of calm clarity helps them trust the app, making them more open to exploring other features. 3. Personalized Suggestions Example: Netflix\u2019s Seamless Auto-Play and Personalization Netflix introduced auto-play of previews and next episodes, along with a dynamic UI that personalizes title images and recommendations for each viewer. Substantially increased viewer engagement and watch time by reducing friction (no more manual browsing). Encouraged binge-watching behaviors, driving up retention and subscription renewals. Reinforced Netflix\u2019s image as a data-driven, user-centered streaming platform. Why It Matters: Creates relevant user journeys: Contextual nudges like \u201cYou could save $X by refinancing\u201d or \u201cTry our new savings plan\u201d resonate more when tailored to the user\u2019s financial profile. Increases product uptake: Users are more inclined to explore new features or products when prompted with concrete, personalized benefits. Builds advisory value: Over time, customers see the bank as a trusted advisor rather than a mere transaction processor. Implementation Tips: Provide contextual offers: \u201cBased on your spending behavior, you could save $X per month if you\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou have $Y available in savings\u2014would you like to explore investing?\u201d Use spending patterns or deposit trends to offer personalized suggestions. Employ simple infographics or progress bars to explain how each recommendation can benefit the user. Dopamine Trigger: Personal Relevance and Novelty: Unexpected or relevant suggestions (\u201cYou can earn 2% more interest!\u201d) provide a pleasant surprise, stimulating dopamine through novelty and perceived reward potential. Timely Interventions: Well-timed prompts (e.g., \u201cYou have $300 left this month\u2014why not set aside $50 in savings?\u201d) give the user a sense of immediate reward for taking a beneficial action. Emotional Effect: Users feel cared for by the bank, experiencing positive emotions from receiving relevant, seemingly tailor-made tips or deals. The bank shifts from a faceless institution to a helpful advisor. 4. High-Quality Visuals Example: Airbnb\u2019s Emphasis on High-Quality Photos Early on, Airbnb discovered that better photos drove more bookings. They made photo quality a prominent part of their listing creation and updated the platform UI to feature large, appealing images. Listings with professional photos earned more views and significantly higher booking rates. Simplified the user journey: travelers could more easily judge the property, which boosted trust and conversions. This visual-first approach became a core design principle for Airbnb, helping them scale globally. Why It Matters: Conveys professionalism: Clean, high-resolution images, intuitive icons and well-structured graphs reinforce the bank\u2019s credibility. Enhances feature adoption: Users are more likely to try budgeting tools, investment products or robo-advisory solutions if the interfaces look polished and easy to understand. Humanizes the brand: Featuring real customer support avatars or representative photos can reassure users that people are behind the scenes. Implementation Tips: Make all your service interfaces aesthetically pleasing, modern and consistently authentic to your brand identity. Replace generic stock images and icons with consistent, authentic illustrations and icons that reflect your brand identity. Ensure all charts and dashboards use clear color coding and labeling for quick comprehension. Use clear, confidence-inspiring illustrations and real images of your representatives or customer support teams. Provide visual dashboards for spending, savings goals or investment performance to reinforce transparency. Dopamine Trigger: Aesthetic Pleasure: Attractive, cohesive visuals can spark aesthetic appreciation, a subtle dopamine release when encountering good design. Emotional Safety: Seeing modern, clean dashboards and friendly illustrations can reduce stress and create a welcoming environment, making it easier for users to feel a small emotional \u201clift.\u201d Emotional Effect: Users experience greater trust and comfort, which is critical in finance. This emotional security can heighten positive user experiences and keep them coming back. 5. Streamlined Onboarding Example: Basecamp\u2019s Simplified Signup Flow The team behind Basecamp is famous for minimalist designs. One change they cite repeatedly is removing unnecessary fields in the signup process and clarifying each step of the workflow. Lowered the barrier to entry, leading to a jump in completed signups. Reinforced the brand\u2019s commitment to frictionless user experiences. Provided a template for many SaaS products that copied the \u201cless friction, more clarity\u201d signup ethos. Why It Matters: Shortens time to value: The faster users can open an account or apply for a loan, the sooner they\u2019ll start engaging with your services. Reduces abandonment: Fewer forms and clearer step-by-step instructions mean less friction and dropout. Enhances perception of modernity: Smooth digital onboarding sets your bank apart from clunky, time-consuming competitors. Implementation Tips: Use progressive forms: show only what\u2019s needed at each step (e.g., personal info, then ID verification, then income details). Integrate real-time validation to catch errors on the spot (e.g., incorrect ID format). Remove extraneous fields or combine them smartly. Dopamine Trigger: Progress Feedback and Small Wins: Breaking down account creation into manageable steps (with real-time feedback) gives the user multiple mini \u201cwins,\u201d each capable of sparking a dopamine release. Reduced Anxiety: A simpler process means less cognitive load, so users can be more receptive to the small emotional highs of completion. Emotional Effect: Users feel accomplished at each step instead of stressed or frustrated. This sense of steady progress encourages them to finish onboarding and remain engaged afterward. 6. Referral Prompts Example: Dropbox\u2019s \u201cGet Space\u201d Referral Prompt Dropbox made a small tweak to highlight their referral program\u2014offering extra storage if you invite friends\u2014more prominently within the app UI. Skyrocketed referral-driven account signups, becoming a core viral loop for Dropbox\u2019s early growth. Simple, unobtrusive calls to action resulted in widespread brand advocacy at a very low cost. Became a legendary example of how product-led growth can hinge on a few well-placed nudges. Why It Matters: Accelerates user acquisition: Referral programs encourage organic word-of-mouth expansion with minimal marketing spend. Increases loyalty: Existing customers get a \u201cwin\u201d when they successfully refer friends or family. Validates trust: People are more likely to trust a bank recommended by someone they know, which can amplify your brand\u2019s reputation. Implementation Tips: Make sharing easy: a simple banner or button in the app that lets users send a unique referral link or code. Offer tangible incentives like cash rewards, waived fees or bonus interest for both parties. Offer a simple in-app invite (\u201cRefer a friend to open a checking account and you both get $XX\u201d). Make the referral prompt a friendly, unobtrusive banner on the homepage or in user settings. Dopamine Trigger: Social Validation and Reward: Getting a bonus for referring a friend\u2014and knowing the friend also benefits\u2014creates a win-win scenario that triggers dopamine both through social approval and the tangible reward (like cash or bonus points). Positive Anticipation: Waiting to see if the referral converts is itself a mini thrill, and receiving the reward spikes dopamine upon success. Emotional Effect: Users feel valued by the bank and take pride in sharing a good product with friends. The reward structure cements loyalty and fosters a community feeling. 7. Progress Bar Example: LinkedIn\u2019s Progress Bar for Profile Completion Adding a visual progress bar and step-by-step guidance encouraged users to complete their profiles or any other applications. More complete profiles led to better matches and increased recruiter engagement and user satisfaction. Significantly boosted LinkedIn\u2019s key metric: time spent on the platform and networking success. Set a precedent for gamified \u201conboarding journeys\u201d now found in countless apps and services. Why It Matters: Encourages thorough KYC: Seeing a profile progress bar can nudge users to verify their address, upload identification or add income details. Improves overall service: A fully updated profile unlocks faster loan decisions, personalized advice and lower compliance risk. Adds a gamification element: Users experience a sense of reward when reaching 100% completion, increasing the likelihood they\u2019ll continue exploring the app. Implementation Tips: Introduce a visual tracker that shows how much of the user\u2019s profile is complete (e.g., address, ID documents, phone verification, etc.). Provide incentives: \u201cComplete your profile to unlock faster loan approvals or instant transfers.\u201d Show clear benefits at each milestone: \u201cAdd your employer to boost credit limit possibilities.\u201d Use celebratory micro-animations or badges when users reach a new completion level. Dopamine Trigger: Gamification and Achievement: Each incremental fill in the progress bar is a mini-achievement, which can consistently trigger small amounts of dopamine as the user edges closer to 100%. Clear Goals and Feedback: The brain loves clear goals with visible feedback loops\u2014hitting them translates into tangible reward signals. Emotional Effect: Users feel rewarded and motivated to complete their profile (or KYC steps), associating the banking app with a sense of accomplishment rather than dread. 8. One-Tap Feedback Example: Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d Button (and Reactions) Initially, adding the simple \u201cLike\u201d button offered a low-effort way to acknowledge posts. Later, other reactions (e.g., love, angry, sad, etc.) were introduced for more nuanced engagement. \u201cLikes\u201d quickly became a core social metric, encouraging users to engage with content. Reactions gave Facebook deeper data on user preferences and emotional responses. The small tweak of going from zero to multiple \u201creactions\u201d changed the way users share feedback, spurring increased interaction. Why It Matters: Ensures continuous improvement: Quick feedback loop helps the bank measure customer satisfaction on-the-go \u201cthumbs up or down\u201d or a 1\u20135 star rating. Customer-centered culture: Creates a culture of continuous improvement, powered by data-driven insights on customer satisfaction. Builds customer trust: Users see the bank is genuinely interested in their experience, not just the transaction. Implementation Tips: After a chat or call with customer support, show a one-tap feedback mechanism (like a thumbs up or 1\u20135 stars). Provide optional expanded reactions for more nuanced feedback (e.g., \u201cfast response,\u201d \u201cfriendly agent,\u201d \u201cissue not resolved\u201d). Instant experience rate request with optional fields for more details: \u201cPlease tell us why\u201d if the user gives a low rating. Sum up feedback in dashboards to identify trends and training opportunities. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Sense of Contribution: Providing a quick reaction or rating triggers a small psychological reward, as the user feels \u201cheard\u201d by the service. Social Mechanism: Positive feedback loops\u2014like a quick \u201cthumbs up\u201d for a helpful chat\u2014mirror social media\u2019s reaction mechanisms, each delivering micro doses of dopamine for both the user and the service agent (if they see high ratings). Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and believe their feedback matters, building a stronger emotional connection and sense of loyalty to the institution. 9. Biometric One-Tap Payment Example: Apple iPhone\u2019s \u201cApple Pay\u201d One-Tap Checkout Apple seamlessly integrated \u201cApple Pay\u201d into the iPhone\u2019s core experience, allowing users to authorize payments with Face ID or Touch ID in just one tap. Eliminated friction: Removing the need to type credit card details or billing addresses significantly shortened the checkout flow. Boosted adoption: Partnerships with major retailers and apps helped \u201cApple Pay\u201d become a ubiquitous, go-to payment method. Strengthened ecosystem: The convenience factor kept users locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, reinforcing brand loyalty. Why It Matters: Frictionless transactions: One-tap or one-look authentication for financial transactions sets a new bar for quick, secure payments in banking apps. Increased user trust: Apple\u2019s strong privacy and security stance assures users that their sensitive data is protected. Future-proofing: As users grow accustomed to instant payments, banks that fail to offer similarly smooth experiences risk losing relevance. Implementation Tips: Biometric integration: Tie into the device\u2019s biometric security (Face ID, Touch ID) to reduce login friction and confirm transactions seamlessly. Enter Apple ecosystem: Present the Add Card to Apple Pay (or equivalent) button prominently in your app. Dopamine Trigger: Instant gratification: The speed and ease of paying with a tap or glance release small hits of dopamine associated with accomplishing tasks effortlessly. Security + convenience rush: Users get the dual reward of feeling both safe and efficient, reinforcing positive emotions. Emotional Effect: The marriage of security and speed makes users feel their bank is modern and protective, increasing emotional loyalty. 10. Recurring Personalized Discovery Example: Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d Personalized Playlists Spotify pioneered user-specific music recommendations with \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d a curated playlist updated each Monday. High engagement: Users often check the playlist regularly, boosting in-app listening time. Built habit loops: The anticipation of new, tailored songs each week fosters a loyal user base. Industry-defining: It became a blueprint for recommendation systems across music and media platforms. Why It Matters: Contextual insights: Banks can similarly offer spending insights or saving tips based on a customer\u2019s \u201cfinancial habits.\u201d Habit formation: Recurring personalized prompts (like monthly spending reviews) can keep users returning to the app. Deep user bonds: Showing you \u201cknow\u201d your customer\u2019s preferences builds trust and longer-term engagement. Implementation Tips: Weekly or monthly insights: Provide automated \u201cFinancial Snapshot\u201d playlists\u2014like recommended budgeting steps or relevant offers Data-driven personalization: Leverage machine learning on user transaction data to highlight products or services with the highest personal benefit. Easy discovery: Place these personalized recommendations front and center on the home screen or via push notifications. Dopamine Trigger: Novelty and surprise: Finding a new favorite song (or, in banking terms, discovering a new benefit) sparks a dopamine hit. Positive reinforcement: When suggestions prove helpful, users feel validated and look forward to more customized tips. Emotional Effect: Users feel recognized on an individual level, forging an emotional link with your brand. 11. Single-Tap Rides Example: Uber\u2019s One-Tap Ride Request Uber simplified ride-hailing to a single tap, automatically detecting location, matching a driver and processing payment in the background. Revolutionized convenience: Removing the need for phone calls, manual address entry or cash changed urban transport globally. Increased retention: Customers repeatedly chose Uber for the seamless experience over traditional cabs or slower competitor apps. Set user expectations: Ride-hailing is now synonymous with \u201ctap, ride, done.\u201d Why It Matters: Reduced friction = higher usage: In finance, simplifying complex tasks (like requesting a loan or splitting bills) can lead to more frequent user activity. Automation of details: Users appreciate not having to re-enter repeated data points, echoing the convenience of \u201cno-cash, no-hassle\u201d rides. Brand differentiation: A bank offering near-instant processes (e.g., quick loan approvals) stands out in a crowded market. Implementation Tips: Auto-fill data: For repeat transactions, pre-fill as many details as possible so users just confirm. Transparent process: Show real-time status updates (e.g., \u201cYour request is being processed,\u201d \u201cApproved in 10 seconds\u201d). Built-in payments: Keep the payment mechanism seamless within the app rather than redirecting to external portals. Dopamine Trigger: Immediate outcome: One-tap actions that instantly produce a tangible result (like calling a ride) reward the brain with a sense of competence. Predictability and control: Knowing exactly when the \u201ccar\u201d or result will arrive fosters calm satisfaction\u2014tiny dopamine bursts. Emotional Effect: Minimizing complexity helps users feel they\u2019re effortlessly in control of their finances, reducing stress. 12. Live Collaboration Canvas Example: Figma\u2019s Real-Time Collaboration Figma introduced live, multi-user editing in a design tool, allowing teams to collaborate in the same file simultaneously. Eliminated version chaos: No more \u201cv2-final-FINAL\u201d file versions. Everyone sees updates instantly. Supercharged productivity: Designers, developers and stakeholders communicate in one place, reducing the number of back-and-forth emails. Community effect: Shared templates and plug-in ecosystems flourished around real-time features, fueling word-of-mouth growth. Why It Matters: Transparent collaboration: In banking apps, real-time co-browsing with support agents or co-managing finances with family members can build trust. Instant updates: Shared budgeting tools or joint account management can show immediate changes, fostering teamwork. Modern user expectations: People now expect seamless, synchronized experiences\u2014bringing that to finance differentiates you from outdated, siloed systems. Implementation Tips: Multi-user features: Offer \u201cjoint account views\u201d in which spouses or business partners see real-time transaction updates and can add notes. Co-browsing support: Enable support reps to view a user\u2019s screen (with permission) to guide them through complex tasks. Notification system: Keep relevant stakeholders in the loop with instant push alerts or in-app updates on shared financial tasks. Dopamine Trigger: Synchronous collaboration joy: Seeing real-time input from others can be exciting and rewarding, sparking mini-dopamine boosts. Reduced friction in teamwork: A frictionless group experience fosters a positive emotional response and a sense of collective achievement. Emotional Effect: Shared ownership and trust provides real-time transparency to build trust among users and between users and the bank. Feeling \u201cin it together\u201d increases satisfaction. 13. Endless Personalized Feed Example: TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d Infinite Feed TikTok\u2019s vertical feed quickly personalized videos based on watch time, likes and replays, hooking users into continuous viewing. Hyper-engagement: The algorithm\u2019s accuracy and infinite scroll keep users scrolling far longer than they initially intend. Viral content engine: Easy video creation plus mass distribution turned TikTok into a cultural phenomenon. Redefined short-form media: The \u201cFor You Page\u201d is now the gold standard for endless, highly personalized entertainment. Why It Matters: Contextual curation: Banks can adopt similar \u201cinfinite\u201d but curated feed concepts\u2014like continuously updated financial insights. User stickiness: Engaging, snackable content (short tips, quick budgeting wins) can keep users returning daily. Behavioral data: By analyzing user interactions, the bank can refine future recommendations, from loyalty offers to credit advice. Implementation Tips: Short-form updates: Provide quick, scrollable financial tips or \u201cstories\u201d (e.g., daily spending insights, saving challenges). Personalized content feed: Prioritize recommendations based on each user\u2019s spending patterns, goals and previous interactions. Easy shareability: Let users quickly share these insights or achievements with friends, echoing TikTok\u2019s social \u201cduet\u201d effect. Dopamine Trigger: Endless novelty: Rapid-fire personalized content can trigger repeated dopamine surges as each new \u201ccard\u201d or insight might bring value. Micro-rewards: Even a small, useful tip or motivational nudge can feel rewarding, encouraging continued scrolling. Emotional Effect: Users feel a slight \u201cthrill\u201d in checking what will come up next, building habit loops around financial literacy. Presenting financial guidance in an engaging feed reduces intimidation and builds a positive, exploratory mindset. Final Thoughts While banks and Fintechs must navigate strict regulations and prioritize robust security, interface innovations needn\u2019t be complex to succeed. A single button, a strategic piece of microcopy or a well-placed progress bar can guide user behavior, inspire trust and drive meaningful business results. In a digital world in which consumers can switch providers with a few taps, thoughtful design enhancements are paramount. By adapting proven UX patterns from retail, media and tech to the specialized needs of finance, banks and Fintechs can surprise and delight customers, creating enduring loyalty. Even minor changes\u2014like shortening forms or enabling one-step transactions\u2014can reduce user effort and boost satisfaction. Clear, streamlined interfaces also reassure users that their finances are secure. Psychological nudges, such as progress bars, rewards or urgency indicators, can further influence positive user behavior while distinguishing forward-thinking institutions from those clinging to legacy systems. By weaving small, gratifying user experiences into every step of the banking journey, financial institutions can harness the power of dopamine to boost user satisfaction and build deeper loyalty\u2014all while helping customers manage their finances in a more streamlined, empowering way. Whether it\u2019s removing unnecessary steps, adding a single button or surfacing the right information at the right time, these micro-optimizations often become major growth levers\u2014proving that small, thoughtful design changes can have an outsized impact on both user behavior and business metrics. Minimize friction: Just like in e-commerce or media streaming, faster and simpler interactions increase conversion and satisfaction in banking. Use microcopy and visual cues: Subtle text prompts, progress bars and well-chosen animations reassure users about the seriousness and security of financial actions. Personalization matters: Deliver the right suggestions at the right time\u2014be it a savings prompt or a referral link\u2014to dramatically increase uptake of financial services. Build trust: In finance, trust is paramount. High-quality visuals, clear confirmations and frictionless onboarding reinforce user confidence. Balance and Transparency: Overusing urgency tactics or \u201cdark patterns\u201d can erode trust. Ethical design focuses on helpful nudges rather than manipulative tricks. Sustainable Engagement: Dopamine-driven design should improve financial wellness and user satisfaction, not pushing impulsive actions. Long-Term Loyalty: Positive \u201cmicro-rewards\u201d around money management encourage recurring, long-term usage of your platform.

The goal is to manufacture an apparent public \u201cconsensus\u201d for more migration, according to Lopez: coordinated [PR] content creates a sense of consensus \u2014 giving people a familiar framework to fall back on when forming opinions. Repetition isn\u2019t noise; it\u2019s how narratives take hold. \u2026 A well-informed public that sees immigrants as neighbors, workers, and contributors is essential for democracy itself. A public misled by fear will support mass deportations, surveillance, and state-sponsored cruelty \u2014 especially when they\u2019re presented as the only available options. \u2026 Pro-immigrant forces will succeed if they offer an alternative vision of a modern immigration system centered on citizenship and safety that empowers working families and fuels democracy. The article promoted a free video where a veteran criticized Trump\u2019s pro-American policy, saying, \u201chis immigration polices are immoral \u2026 it goes against all the values that I learned in the military.\u201d \u201cThe real issue isn\u2019t policy; it\u2019s communication,\u201d Lopez said in a March 6 post against national solidarity.\u201dIt\u2019s time to go on offense, flood the zone, and make the case for a country that works for all of us.\u201d In reality, the federal government uses a ruthless economic policy of Extraction Migration to grow Wall Street \u2014 and Powell Jobs\u2019 stock wealth \u2014 by importing more consumers, renters, and workers from developing countries, regardless of the massive pocketbook and civic damage to ordinary Americans and the migrants\u2019 own countries. For example, under President Joe Biden\u2019s high-migration policies, 300 million blue-collar and white-collar Americans lost wealth in the labor and housing markets, and the workplace investment, productivity, and training once enabled by employers. Many college graduates also lost career opportunities as his deputies expanded the inflow of white-collar workers, such as H-1B visa workers . FLASHBACK: 1,500 Migrants Surge Across Border into Texas in Six Hours Citizens also lost civic stability to government-imposed social diversity , and hey l cal power to the expanding blocs of ethnic voters who continue to demand more benefits for their imported communities, cultures, and home countries. Americans have also grown disgusted at their government\u2019s migration policy because it used billions of their dollars to extract human resources from poor countries for use in the U.S. economy- while also causing thousands of deaths among migrants and Americans , plus massive civic damage to the sending countries . Many polls show Americans\u2019 growing opposition to migration amid expensive propaganda from Powell Jobs and other billionaires. In February, Lopez used her CatalyzeUS Substack post to claim that Powell Jobs\u2019 pro-migration message is being overpowered by Trump\u2019s pro-enforcement messages. The best message in the world is useless if no one hears it. Republicans understand this , which is why they aren\u2019t just repeating anti-immigrant lies\u2014they\u2019re saturating every platform, every news cycle, and every medium to ensure no other narrative breaks through. Their propaganda isn\u2019t winning on merit; it\u2019s filling a void left by Democratic silence . While the right floods the airwaves with fearmongering, Democrats act as if polling alone will save them, assuming facts will speak for themselves. But facts don\u2019t win battles\u2014feelings do . Yet her pro-migration side has far more lobbyists on the payroll, more friendly media coverage, and far more elite support. For example, Powell Jobs uses her multi-billion inheritance from Apple founder Steve Jobs to push for more economic migration that transfers ordinary Americans\u2019 wages to wealthy investors. Similarly, billionaire Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Pos t, and its migration coverage almost entirely ignores the economic and civic damage done by American communities by Biden\u2019s illegal and legal migrants, such as H-1B workers. Mark Zuckerberg and a truckload of other billionaires helped created the FWD.us lobbying group, which played a huge role in the Biden administration. After the election, its top officials blamed poor messaging for the public\u2019s reaction to the wealth-shifting inflow of roughly 14 million legal and illegal migrants. \u201cThis election was about rebuking the fact that Biden governed on this issue very poorly, and people did not like what they saw, and they were not hearing a coherent policy or messaging answer on what was coming next,\u201d Andrea Flores, the Vice President of Immigration Policy & Campaigns at FWD.us, said in December. Extraction Migration also does huge damage to migrants, but their suffering is ignored by the establishment media when it cannot be used to sway U.S. politics .

Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. WASHINGTON: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining The Market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

By Sankalp Phartiyal, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:45 IST Photo Credit: Apple iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now Highlights The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn's factory Apple will increasingly prioritise iPhones from India for US Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India Advertisement Apple assembled $22 billion (roughly Rs. 1,89,412 crore) worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months ended March, increasing production by nearly 60 percent over the previous year in a sign of continued diversification away from China. The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now makes 20 percent, or one in five, of its prized iPhones in the South Asian country, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information isn't public. The dollar figure represents the devices' estimated factory gate value, rather than the marked-up retail price. The ramp-up suggests the iPhone maker and its suppliers are accelerating a pivot to India from China, a process it began when harsh Covid lockdowns hurt production at Apple's largest plant. The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn Technology Group's factory in southern India. Tata Group's electronics manufacturing arm, which bought Wistron Corp. and controls Pegatron Corp.'s operations, is also a key supplier. Apple, Nvidia Score Relief From US Tariffs With Exemptions Apple did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Of the total India production, Apple exported 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.4 billion) in iPhones from the region in the fiscal year through March 2025, the nation's technology minister said on April 8. Shipments of iPhones from India to the US accelerated after President Donald Trump announced his plans for the so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs in February, the people said. Apple's average India production and exports surged all through the fiscal year to March. Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be in Development With This Notable Upgrade Apple will increasingly prioritize iPhones from the India supply chain for its US customers, Bloomberg News reported previously. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronics goods including smartphones and computers from its reciprocal tariffs. That's good news for companies such as Apple and Nvidia , though the reprieve doesn't appear to extend to Trump's separate 20 percent duty on China, applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl. This also means iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now. Barring the exceptions made Friday, Trump's cumulative levies on China remain at 145 percent and will likely force companies such as Apple to intensify their supply chain shift. But with nearly 200 suppliers and an overwhelming reliance on China, moves to other countries could take years to play out. Despite Trump's ambition to have iPhones made in the US, Apple is unlikely to move production there any time soon due to factors including a shortage of facilities and labor needed to produce the devices. Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has often praised China's high-level of skill in making its marquee devices. In 2022, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated it would take eight years to move just 10 percent of Apple's production capacity out of China. Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India, including the more expensive titanium Pro models . Its manufacturing success in the world's most populous nation is also helped by state subsidies tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to turn the country into a manufacturing hub. Modi is also seeking to widen electronics component manufacturing with $2.7 billion (roughly Rs. 23,246 crore) in new financial incentives, and is focused on advancing its semiconductor ambitions. Apple has a nearly eight percent market share in India's smartphone market, where its sales \u2014 a bulk of those from iPhones \u2014 reached almost $8 billion (roughly Rs. 68,877 crore) in fiscal 2024. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Japan's Nikkei rises as iPhone-related stocks jump \"The market is still swayed by various headlines,\" said Yugo Tsuboi, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. By Reuters Updated - April 14, 2025 at 01:15 PM. File photo: A screen displays the Nikkei 225 Stock Average outside a securities firm in Tokyo, Japan. | Photo Credit: Shoko Takayasu Japan's Nikkei share average ended higher on Monday, as iPhone-related shares jumped after the United States excluded smartphones and other electronics from steep tariffs . The Nikkei gained 1.18 per cent to close at 33,982.36, after gaining as much as 2.22 per cent earlier in the session. The broader Topix rose 0.88 per cent to end at 2,488.51. \"The market is still swayed by various headlines,\" said Yugo Tsuboi, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. \"And none of them are good enough to encourage investors to take their positions confidently.\" U.S. President Donald Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China, providing a big break to tech firms like Apple that rely on imported products. However, both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed in a month or so. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China Trump had announced hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries on April 2, triggering a market rout, but reversed them with a 90-day freeze shortly after they went into effect. A 10 per cent blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports remains in effect. The Nikkei has declined 5 per cent since what Trump called \"Liberation Day\", after posting huge swings last week. The sudden moves underscored investor anxieties as they tried to gauge the fallout from the U.S. trade policy. Still, shares of i Phone suppliers rose on Monday, with Murata Manufacturing gaining 1.65 per cent. TDK jumped 4.27 per cent and Taiyo Yuden surged 6 per cent. Chip-testing equipment maker Advantest jumped 4.92 per cent to provide the biggest boost to the Nikkei. Of more than 1,600 stocks trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's prime market, 80 per cent rose, 16 per cent fell, while 2 per cent traded flat.

It\u2019s supremely versatile, able to act as a laptop replacement for when you need to do office work, and a sketching pad when you don\u2019t. It runs pro-level apps, though the selection is a bit limited, and though iPadOS has its shortcomings compared to a full-blown Mac, if you can work around them it makes an ideal everyday companion.

Buy it if Don't buy it if Also consider TODAY'S BEST DEALS \u00a3299 at Currys \u00a3799 at very.co.uk \u00a3799 at John Lewis The 2025 edition of the iPad Air, in its 13-inch incarnation at least, feels like an iPad Pro. It has the same flat sides, heft in the hand, and speaker grilles that Pac-Man would gobble up as the M1 monster that brought desktop-class chips to tablets, but instead sports an M3. The extra processing grunt means apps like Affinity Photo and the iPad versions of Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve absolutely fly, and the Apple Pencil Pro makes it ideal for sketching too. There's a keyboard case that turns it into a kind of laptop, and the USB-C port means there's no scrabbling around for a compatible charger. It\u2019s not cheap, but with its surprisingly reasonable starting price (though you're going to want to upgrade the base specs, which gets expensive fast), this might be the best tablet for creative s right now \u2013 and it's certainly winging its way to the best iPad for drawing guide. Key specifications (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) Swipe to scroll horizontally CPU: Apple M3 NPU: 16-core Neural Engine Graphics: Integrated, nine cores Memory: 8GB Storage: 128GB - 1TB Screen size: 11 or 13in (version tested) Screen type: LED-backlit IPS touchscreen Resolution: 2,732 x 2,048 (version tested) Refresh rate: 60Hz Colour gamut (claimed): P3 wide colour Brightness (claimed): 600 nits Ports: 1x USB-C (10Gbps) Wireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G eSIM (optional) Dimensions: 281 x 215 x 6mm (13in model) Weight: 616 grams (version tested) Design, build and display (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) Apple makes great tablets. There's no need to say anything else. The 2025 edition of the iPad Air retains the design of the 2024 model, with flat sides and rounded corners. The back has lost the \u2018iPad\u2019 wordmark but the Apple logo remains, and there's a single camera lens to mark the Air out from the better-endowed Pro, but they share the three-dot connector for the Magic Keyboard on the back. Apple iPad Air M3 13 (White) at Currys for \u00a3299 It\u2019s a very restrained design, with all the attention focused instead on the screen. As your main way of interacting with a tablet, this is to be expected, and the rest of the iPAd fades into the background when you\u2019re engrossed in the display. The edges of the iPad Air are broken by the little plastic sections that denote the points at which antennas pass through the metal to get a better signal, and there are four speakers split between top and bottom. The USB-C port sits where you\u2019d expect it to, and there are the usual volume rocker and lock buttons too, the latter doubling as a fingerprint reader. You may like Apple somehow managed to make the iPad line up even stranger The best iPad for graphic design The 12in iPad Air is lighter than a laptop but heavier than some other tablets - though it is quite large, which immediately means it will weigh more, and will require a bag that can fit a thin and light laptop to carry with you. Apple doesn\u2019t say what the glass covering the touchscreen is, but the entire build feels stiff and assured in the hand, though there's no IP rating, so it might be best to keep it dry and clean. \u2022 Sturdy design \u2022 Nothing new Design score: 4/5 Features (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) Most of the iPad Air\u2019s features are software-based, as the tablet itself is bare apart from a single USB-C port that\u2019s not a Thunderbolt. It doesn\u2019t have Face ID for unlocking, relying instead on Touch ID through the lock button, and there's only a single wide-angle camera lens on the back. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, however. All of these things are perfectly acceptable on a tablet - the USB-C port still does video out, and 10Gbps is fast enough for all but the highest resolution images and video files. Using a tablet to take photos is a sub-optimal experience at best, and so extra tele and ultrawide lenses will be largely redundant. The iPad Air is compatible with Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard and both types of Apple Pencil - the Pro model introduces a new twist sensor and a squeeze gesture to make quick changes, as well as having customisable haptic feedback, but costs \u00a350 more. The Magic Keyboard sports a trackpad so it\u2019s possible to use the iPad more like a laptop, and iPadOS has features like Stage Manager to make use of external monitors. The OS itself has improved since it split from iOS . Apple Intelligence is now built in, and of course you get Siri voice control and iCloud for your documents. It still feels like working on an oversized phone rather than a desktop OS, however, which may put some off, but if you\u2019re prepared to operate within its constraints it can do almost anything a laptop can. \u2022 OS improvements \u2022 Only one USB port Feature score: 3/5 Benchmark scores Swipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Header Cell - Column 1 Apple iPad Air M3 GEEKBENCH 6 CPU Single-core: 3029 Row 1 - Cell 0 CPU Multi-core: 11888 Row 2 - Cell 0 GPU Metal: 46023 3D Mark Steel Nomad Light: 2623, 19.4fps Row 4 - Cell 0 Wild Life Extreme: 5638, 33.8fps Row 5 - Cell 0 Solar Bay: 9594, 36.5 fps Performance (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) The M3 was an excellent chip when we first reviewed it in a MacBook Air back in 2024, and it remains so now. The iPad Pro may have made the leap up to M4, but it also costs twice as much. In 3D Mark\u2019s Steel Nomad, a graphics test for high-end mobile devices that scales its 1440p action to the native screen resolution and looks like a modern console game, the M3 Air managed a sliver under 20 FPS, which is just about a playable framerate but not exactly smooth - if scores can be compared across platforms, then the M3 iPad does worse than a PC with a GeForce GTX 1650 card in it. The same is true in Wild Life Extreme, a 4K benchmark that is considered too heavy for most phones and tablets, so the Air is doing well to get 33 FPS on average. In the Geekbench tests, the Air\u2019s score in the multi-core benchmark is just slightly below that of an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, a 12-core desktop processor from 2020. That\u2019s an excellent result for a tablet. As a better comparison, an M1 version of the iPad Pro we had laying around the office scored 3,000 points less than the M3 iPad Air in the multi-core CPU test, a difference of almost 30%. So we\u2019re looking at an excellent processor, that\u2019s slightly weak in the GPU area but no more than most chips that use integrated graphics. The problem with iPadOS for creatives is the software: you\u2019ve got versions (with missing features) of Photoshop , Lightroom and Illustrator, plus the full Affinity suite, DaVinci Resolve, Procreate, Sketchup, Nomad Sculpt, Pixelmator Pro and more, along with GarageBand and Logic Pro. If those are good enough for you, or you\u2019re prepared to learn something new, then Apple has made a productivity powerhouse. If not, then a traditional laptop may be more appealing. Battery life is tricky to evaluate on a tablet, as none of the standardised tests we usually use are available, but Apple claims 10 hours of endurance out of a charge, and that feels a little high but not too far off the mark. It will last all day, but the battery life is down compared to the M1 and M2 models. \u2022 Desktop-class performance \u2022 Software limitations Performance score: 5/5 Price (Image credit: Future / Ian Evenden) The iPad Air base price is deceptive. \u00a3799 for the 13in sounds like a good deal for a tablet of this quality, but once you\u2019ve added the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard it\u2019s suddenly \u00a31,098. Then as you upgrade the storage, the price climbs even higher. You could buy the base model 13in MacBook Air M4 for \u00a3999, and have more RAM, twice the storage, and \u00a3100 back in your pocket, though the laptop doesn\u2019t come with a touchscreen. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra costs a lot more. It means that the iPad can be a tricky recommendation - they make truly excellent creative machines, but the price can be somewhat daunting. Value score: 3/5 Who is it for? \u2022 Creatives and students The iPad Air is hugely versatile, able to be used for sketching as well as word processing and everything in between. Having just one USB port is a definite limitation, so you will need a hub if you\u2019re doing serious work on it, but the possibilities are endless. With a desktop-class CPU at its heart, you\u2019ll never feel slowed down, and with excellent battery life the Air is a great choice for a main or backup machine.

This time-oriented approach emphasizes intentional planning and aligning tasks with your available time, helping you reduce stress and streamline your workflow. By integrating tools like calendars, task managers, and notes apps, the system avoids unnecessary complexity while promoting simplicity and clarity. Here\u2019s how you can adopt this method to enhance your productivity and maintain better control over your responsibilities. Imagine starting your week with a clear plan, knowing exactly what needs your attention and when. No more endless lists or last-minute scrambling\u2014just a focused, intentional way to tackle your responsibilities. The Time Sector System is designed to help you do just that by aligning your tasks with your available time, so you can prioritize what truly matters without overloading yourself. Whether you\u2019re managing work deadlines, personal errands, or long-term goals, this system offers a practical solution to streamline your workflow and create a sense of calm amidst the busyness. TL;DR Key Takeaways : The Time Sector System focuses on managing tasks based on when they need to be done, prioritizing timeframes like \u201cthis week\u201d or \u201cnext week\u201d to reduce overwhelm and improve focus. It emphasizes intentional weekly planning, aligning tasks with calendar commitments and available time to create a realistic and achievable workload. Effective use of tools is key: notes apps for storing project materials, task managers for actionable tasks, and calendars for deadlines and time-specific commitments. Streamlining work and personal tasks into a unified system simplifies workflows, while periodic reviews of long-term tasks help maintain a clutter-free and efficient system. Email tasks are managed by categorizing quick actions and complex tasks separately, while collaborative tools and selective use of deadlines ensure clarity and reduce complexity. Prioritizing Tasks by Time The core principle of the Time Sector System is categorizing tasks based on timeframes, such as \u201cthis week,\u201d \u201cnext week,\u201d or \u201clong-term.\u201d This time-focused structure shifts your attention from overwhelming to-do lists to manageable priorities. By concentrating on what needs to be done within a specific period, you can avoid the stress of juggling too many tasks simultaneously and focus on what truly matters. A critical practice in this system is intentional weekly planning. At the start of each week, you manually assign tasks to the \u201cthis week\u201d category. This ensures your workload aligns with your calendar commitments and available time. By doing so, you prevent overloading your schedule and set yourself up for achievable, focused progress. This deliberate planning process helps you stay proactive rather than reactive, giving you a clear sense of direction for the week ahead. Choosing the Right Tools To implement the Time Sector System effectively, it\u2019s essential to use the right tools in distinct but complementary ways. Each tool plays a specific role in maintaining an organized and efficient workflow: Notes Apps: Use these to store project-related materials, such as emails, documents, and links. Keeping all relevant information in one place ensures it\u2019s easily accessible when you\u2019re working on a task, reducing the time spent searching for resources. Task Managers: Assign actionable tasks to your task manager, linking them to project notes if necessary. This keeps your task list focused, prevents it from becoming overwhelming, and ensures that every task has a clear purpose and context. Calendars: Reserve your calendar for deadlines and time-specific commitments. Treat it as a \u201csacred space\u201d to maintain a clear and uncluttered view of your schedule, making sure that you can easily visualize your time commitments without distractions. By clearly defining the role of each tool, you create a cohesive system that minimizes confusion, eliminates redundancy, and maximizes efficiency. This structured approach ensures that your tools work together seamlessly, supporting your productivity rather than complicating it.

A unified approach simplifies your workflow, reduces the risk of overlooking important responsibilities, and ensures that all aspects of your life are accounted for in one place. However, if your workplace enforces specific policies regarding task management tools, you may need to maintain separate systems for work and personal tasks. In such cases, ensure both systems are easy to manage and do not create unnecessary complexity. Consistency in how you organize and prioritize tasks across systems will help you maintain clarity and avoid confusion. Handling Email Tasks Effectively Emails often contain actionable items, but without a proper system, they can quickly become overwhelming. The Time Sector System offers a straightforward way to manage email-related tasks: Quick Actions: For tasks that require minimal effort, such as brief replies, use an \u201caction this day\u201d email folder to keep them organized and easily accessible. This ensures that small tasks don\u2019t get lost in your inbox. Complex Tasks: For tasks that require more time or effort, transfer them to your task manager. This allows you to prioritize them alongside your other responsibilities and ensures they are addressed in a timely manner. This approach prevents your inbox from becoming a chaotic to-do list and helps you stay on top of email-related tasks. By separating quick actions from more complex tasks, you can manage your email workload more effectively and maintain a clear focus on your priorities. Reviewing Long-Term Tasks Over time, long-term and on-hold tasks can accumulate, creating unnecessary clutter in your system. To maintain a streamlined workflow, schedule periodic reviews\u2014such as quarterly check-ins\u2014to evaluate these tasks. During these reviews, remove items that are no longer relevant and focus on maintaining a manageable list of long-term priorities. Regular reviews ensure that your system remains effective, up-to-date, and aligned with your current goals. This practice also helps you identify opportunities to move long-term tasks into actionable categories, keeping your progress steady and intentional. Collaborating on Shared Tasks For shared responsibilities, such as team projects or household tasks, collaborative tools like Apple Reminders or Microsoft To Do can be highly effective. These apps allow multiple users to update and manage lists in real time, reducing miscommunication and fostering seamless collaboration. By using shared tools, you can ensure that everyone involved has access to the same information and can contribute to the task\u2019s progress. This approach not only improves efficiency but also strengthens accountability within teams or households. Managing Deadlines and Task Dates Deadlines are best managed within your calendar, where they can be visualized alongside other time-specific commitments. Avoid assigning deadlines to tasks in your task manager unless absolutely necessary, as this can create unnecessary complexity and anxiety. Similarly, only assign dates to tasks when they are tied to specific deadlines or review points. This selective approach keeps your system simple, focused, and free from clutter. By reserving your calendar for critical deadlines and commitments, you can maintain a clear overview of your time and avoid overloading your schedule. Gaining Clarity and Control The Time Sector System enables you to take control of your tasks by aligning them with your available time and priorities. Through intentional planning, the strategic use of tools, and a streamlined workflow, you can reduce anxiety, improve efficiency, and maintain a sense of clarity. By adopting this system, you\u2019ll not only stay organized but also gain the confidence to manage your responsibilities effectively. This method offers a practical and sustainable way to balance your workload, making sure that you can focus on what truly matters while staying in control of your time.

By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

Priced at $999, it offers a compelling balance of performance and value, making it an attractive option for a wide range of users. While its design remains familiar, the M4 introduces enhancements that cater to modern needs and elevate the overall user experience. Below is a detailed video from Created Tech of its design, features, performance, and value. Watch this video on YouTube . Design and Key Features The M4 MacBook Air retains the slim, lightweight design introduced with the M2 redesign in 2022, emphasizing portability and elegance. While the overall aesthetic remains consistent, Apple has refreshed the lineup with a new sky-blue color, replacing the space gray option. This subtle yet modern update adds a fresh touch to the minimalist design. Key features of the M4 MacBook Air include: Center Stage Webcam: The upgraded webcam incorporates Center Stage technology, which intelligently adjusts to keep you centered during video calls. This feature enhances the experience for remote work, virtual meetings, and online collaboration. Dual External Monitor Support: Unlike its predecessors, the M4 supports two external monitors without requiring the laptop screen to be closed. This improvement significantly boosts multitasking capabilities and productivity for users managing multiple workflows. These refinements, while not new, enhance usability and align with the demands of modern users, making the M4 a practical choice for both personal and professional use. Performance: Incremental but Meaningful Upgrades The M4 chip introduces modest yet impactful improvements in both CPU and GPU performance. While the differences may not be immediately noticeable for everyday tasks, the M4 includes hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a feature that benefits users engaged in gaming, 3D modeling, or other graphics-intensive workflows. This enhancement enables smoother rendering and more realistic visuals, elevating the device\u2019s capabilities for creative professionals. Additional performance upgrades include: 16 GB Base RAM: The M4 doubles the base RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB, making sure smoother multitasking and better performance with resource-intensive applications. This upgrade also future-proofs the device for evolving software requirements. Faster SSD Speeds: Improved read and write speeds result in quicker file transfers, faster app loading times, and an overall more responsive user experience. For routine activities such as web browsing, media consumption, and document editing, the performance differences between the M1, M2, M3, and M4 are relatively minor. However, the M4\u2019s enhancements make it a more versatile and reliable option for users seeking longevity and adaptability in their devices. Battery Life and Thermal Performance The M4 chip brings a slight improvement in battery efficiency, offering an additional hour or two of usage compared to earlier models. While this increase may not be dramatic, it provides added convenience for users who rely on their laptops for extended periods without access to a power source. Thermal performance remains consistent with previous Apple Silicon MacBook Air models. The passive cooling system effectively manages heat during typical workloads, making sure silent operation. Even under heavy use, the M4 maintains comparable heat levels to its predecessors, with no significant thermal throttling observed. This consistency reinforces the MacBook Air\u2019s reputation for reliability and comfort during prolonged use. Pricing and Value Proposition At $999, the M4 MacBook Air redefines affordability within Apple\u2019s laptop lineup. The inclusion of 16 GB base RAM, faster SSD speeds, and other upgrades makes it a strong contender for users seeking a cost-effective yet capable device. In comparison, the M2 and M3 models launched at higher price points and offered fewer features, making the M4 a more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. For those considering older models, the M1, M2, and M3 remain viable choices, particularly when purchased secondhand at discounted prices. However, these models are best suited for basic tasks and should ideally include 16 GB of RAM to handle modern software demands effectively. The M4, with its enhanced specifications, offers better long-term value and versatility for a broader range of use cases. Who Should Buy the M4 MacBook Air? The M4 MacBook Air is an excellent choice for users seeking a well-rounded laptop that balances price, performance, and features. Its upgrades, such as the 16 GB base RAM, faster SSD, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing, make it suitable for casual users, students, and professionals with moderate computing needs. For those with more demanding workflows, such as video editing, software development, or advanced 3D rendering, a MacBook Pro may be a better fit due to its higher performance capabilities. However, for most users, the M4 MacBook Air offers a versatile and future-proof solution that meets a wide range of requirements. The M4 MacBook Air stands out as a practical and affordable option in Apple\u2019s lineup, delivering meaningful improvements that enhance the user experience without compromising on design or reliability. Whether you\u2019re upgrading from an older model or purchasing your first MacBook, the M4 offers a compelling combination of performance, features, and value.

Samsung slams the brakes on One UI 7 for Galaxy S24 and Z Fold 6 - PhoneArena Google Pixel 9 is discounted here! Home News You are here Shocker! Samsung slams the brakes on One UI 7 for Galaxy S24 and Z Fold 6 By Iskra Petrova Published: Apr 14, 2025, 2:29 AM 4 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Galaxy S Series Up Next: It appears Samsung has halted the One UI 7 push for Galaxy S24 phones. After months and months of delays and plenty of annoyance to Samsung fans, Samsung finally started releasing its Android 15 -based One UI 7 to supported phones, including the Galaxy S24 series. Now, however, Galaxy S24 series owners may be in for a shock, at least in Europe and Korea... as it seems the One UI 7 update has been pulled off the air . The One UI 7 update for the Galaxy S24 Ultra is still online on Samsung's servers, but the update for the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus appears to be gone. In the meantime, reputable tipster IceUniverse has chimed in with what could be the potential reason for the One UI 7 update to be removed from Samsung's servers. The tipster claims that an unexpected bug that is causing some Galaxy devices to not be able to be unlocked normally has made Samsung take dramatic measures. IceUniverse says the bug was found during the update in Korea and its discovery has reportedly halted the push of the update globally. According to the tipster, the bug with unlocking the phone doesn't occur in all cases, but apparently, it occurs enough for Samsung to slam the breaks.

The Galaxy S24 phones were on One UI 7 's beta program for months, and initially, One UI 7 was delayed, despite the Galaxy S25 series arriving with the new software out of the box. It is not known at this time how quickly Samsung will resolve the bug on the S24 series. It also seems the One UI 7 update has also been removed for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 : it's not clear if the same bug is responsible for that, but it's quite likely. This is frankly somewhat of a huge blunder given how long Galaxy S24 and other phone owners have been waiting to get a taste of Android 15 . An unlocking bug seems a pretty big deal though, as if you can't unlock your phone, you basically can't do anything with it. It seems to be the year of software struggle, at least for the big players on the market: Samsung and Apple. Apple has not had real delays with iOS versions, but it's failed to provide the promised Siri features to iPhone users , which is a pretty big deal . Nonetheless, I do hope the situation gets fixed quickly for Samsung so S24 owners can enjoy the new software sooner rather than later. Did you enjoy reading this article?

In 2025, its parent company, Alphabet, is a vast multinational technology conglomerate and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. While much of Alphabet\u2019s growth was internal, it also added to its empire through shrewd acquisitions, including of Android, DoubleClick and YouTube. Since 1998, it has acquired at least 267 companies . Alphabet is a key player in many digital markets, including general search, browsers, online advertising, mobile operating systems and intermediation. Google Search, for example, is now the most widely used general search engine in the world. Globally, its market share has been at least 78% for the past 10 years . Unsurprisingly, antitrust agencies, whose task is to protect competition, have been taking a close look at Google\u2019s conduct and that of other tech giants. While having market power is not illegal if it is the result of a superior product, protecting such a position by means that are not meritorious is.

In 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , the European Commission fined Google over \u20ac8 billion for abusing dominant positions in key markets \u2013 more than any other Big Tech company to date. A fourth investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the advertising technology market , in which the European Commission is likely to request structural changes to Google\u2019s advertising business, is nearing completion. The national competition agencies of the EU member states have also actively enforced EU and national abuse-of-dominance rules. Private antitrust class actions for damages are adding to Google\u2019s woes. In 2022, the EU enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to create an additional tool for intervening against entrenched market power in core platform markets. The DMA regulates the behaviour of so-called gatekeeper companies, aiming to make markets more contestable for competitors and fairer for users. In September 2023, the European Commission designated Alphabet as a gatekeeper in no fewer than eight platform markets for the following services: Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Google Ads, Chrome, YouTube and Google Android. Within days of the DMA\u2019s conduct rules becoming binding on Alphabet in March 2024, the European Commission opened the first noncompliance investigation to assess whether Google Search was continuing to treat Alphabet\u2019s own services more favourably than its rivals\u2019, and whether Google Play prevented app developers from steering consumers to other channels for better offers. For the Trump administration, EU rules amount to non-tariff restrictions The territorial scope of these rules is limited to services offered in Europe. They do not regulate how Google operates in the United States \u2013 this is subject to US antitrust law. Nonetheless, the European Commission\u2019s enforcement actions have provoked the ire of the current US administration. In February 2025, the White House issued a memorandum titled \u201cDefending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties\u201d that takes issue with European antitrust and regulatory measures against US companies. According to the Trump administration, the EU\u2019s rules amount to non-tariff restrictions and unfair exploitation of US companies, and they interfere with American sovereignty. The memorandum stresses that Washington will not hesitate to impose tariffs and other actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States. According to the European Union, such actions would amount to economic coercion and interfere with its legislative sovereignty to decide under what conditions services are offered on European soil. In 2022, likely with the possibility of a second Trump presidency in mind, it enacted the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument , which allows the European Commission to impose a wide range of \u201cresponse measures\u201d, including tariffs and restrictions on imports, exports, intellectual property rights, foreign direct investment, and access to public procurement. Such response measures could be imposed on US digital services. Potential for escalation The situation has the potential to further escalate the risk of a trade war between Europe and the United States. However, the dispute over tech regulation does not appear to be about substantive antitrust principles per se. In 2020, the US House of Representatives issued a bipartisan report stressing the need for the United States to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice subsequently brought antitrust lawsuits against all four companies, most of which are still pending. The Department of Justice filed two separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020 and in 2023 . In the first case, a Washington DC district court in August 2024 found Google guilty of violating section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and established that Google had attempted to protect its monopoly power in the market for general search through anticompetitive means. Judge Amit P. Mehta is now determining appropriate remedies, and the Department of Justice recently reiterated its request that the judge break up Google . The second US case against Google is still pending. The accusations in it are similar to those underlying the European Commission\u2019s ongoing investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the market for advertising technology. While the case was initiated during the Biden administration, it has not (yet) been shut down since Trump returned to power. It\u2019s also worth noting that the new head of the Federal Trade Commission has stressed that Big Tech is a main priority of his agency . There seems to be concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Google has been restricting competition. The crux of the discord, most likely, is that European regulators are telling US companies what to do \u2013 even if on European territory. Europe lacks equivalents to Big Tech The European Commission appears determined to keep enforcing its antitrust rules and the DMA. On March 19, 2025, it informed Alphabet that its preliminary assessment had shown that Google\u2019s behaviour in search and in the Google Play Store was incompatible with the DMA. Also, the first noncompliance decisions against Apple and Meta under the DMA are expected shortly \u2013 even though the fines may well stay below the maximum 10% of a company\u2019s global annual turnover allowed by the act, in view of its novelty. Europe is not an insignificant market for Google and other US tech companies. In 2024, Google reportedly generated 29% of its global revenue, or $100 billion , in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Europe has no equivalents to Google or other Big Tech companies, and the EU today imports 80% of its digital technology . In September 2024, the Draghi Report issued a stark warning to bloc leaders, highlighting waning geopolitical stability and the need for Europe to focus on closing the innovation gap with the US and China in advanced technologies. Less than five months later, the European Commission published the Competitiveness Compass , a roadmap to restoring Europe\u2019s dynamism and boosting economic growth. Strong measures from the White House in retaliation for European antitrust and regulatory enforcement might just give this process additional impetus. President Trump cannot make European tech great again, because it never was great. But his policies may unintentionally help make it so.

Industry Events 2025 Our directory of industry events SHOP Ex-Max, Hulu acquisitions exec Jonathan Melber named head of global licensing at Apple TV+ Apple TV+\u2019s recent original The Studio Apple TV+ has appointed former Hulu and Max acquisitions executive Jonathan Melber as its head of global licensing. California-based Melber has served as a consultant to the tech giant\u2019s streaming platform since September 2023. Until now, Apple TV+\u2019s content library has almost entirely comprised its own original projects, though speculation began to ramp up last year that the streamer was looking to bring more acquired third-party content on to the service to complement its originals, bulk up its overall offering and expand its subscriber base. In November, the company began looking for a head of global licensing. According to the job listing, the Culver City-based position is responsible for leading negotiations to acquire content both exclusively and non-exclusively across multiple regions, including North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. The position also involves ensuring regulatory compliance in all of the global territories where Apple TV+ operates. Melber was previously senior VP of content acquisition at HBO Max, until 2022. Before that, he was VP of content monetisation at Turner Networks and also worked in Hulu\u2019s content acquisition department. Apple TV+\u2019s roster of recent originals includes The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbours, Disclaimer and Severance. Industry trade publication Puck was first to report Melber\u2019s appointment.

With ambitions at hand, Apple is aiming to win the AR race against Meta, as it is a solid contender in the market that designs products with general use cases. Tim Cook is also set to beat Meta in \"industry-leading\" AR glasses, which would expand the company's AR product line. Tim Cook is set to beat Meta in the smart glasses race, but the true AR glasses will take time to be perfected A new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that Apple CEO Tim Cook \"cares about nothing else,\" according to an Apple engineer. However, building AR glasses might take a lot of time, even for a tech giant like Apple. Gurman claims that Apple is working on its own rendition of the smart glasses with AR capabilities, which will be pretty similar to the Meta Ray-Bans, housing cameras, and sensors. While the work is in progress, AR glasses are Tim Cook's \"top priority\" at this stage, indicating that we might see the wearable sooner than expected. Related Story Apple Takes Global Smartphone Crown In Q1 For The First Time, Thanks To iPhone 16e\u2019s Affordable Price And Mass Appeal That Helped It Outsell Every Other Brand Apple will utilize its Apple Intelligence branch, which will ultimately make the AR glasses a lot more useful than Meta's rendition. However, Apple Intelligence still has time to keep up with the industry, as the company has previously delayed one of the major Personalized Siri features until next year. While the delay was announced officially, we have also heard that the company is ramping up the development of the delayed features, which might be available in the fall of this year. The AR glasses from Apple will be built around Siri and its deeper integration with AI, but the company does have privacy concerns, as the wearable will capture media from one of its cameras. The Cupertino tech giant wants to be different from Meta in this regard and could potentially be working on a workaround that would prevent these privacy concerns. While Tim Cook's \"interim solution\" will compete against the likes of Meta, the company is also working on true AR glasses, which will require more time and advanced technologies that are yet to \"be perfected.\" A variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day. Apple also needs to figure out applications that make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. And all this has to be available in large quantities at a price that won\u2019t turn off consumers. Apple could launch smart glasses in the near future to better compete against Meta until it sorts out technologies and the cost associated with it to make it easier for the end user.

We did \u2014 thanks to a comic from the Bhamla Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Since 2020, principal investigator Saad Bhamla has been leading the charge to make science more accessible by publishing comics alongside every paper his lab publishes. Today, he introduces Emily to two of the most popular characters \u2014 Sheriff Sharpshooter and Captain Cicada \u2014 and shares why a comic about butt-flicking insects is a valuable way to take science beyond the lab.

Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab hide caption toggle caption Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab This panel is from the \"Slingshot Spiders\" comic that describes the manuscript \"Ultrafast launch of slingshot spiders using conical silk webs\", published in the journal Current Biology . Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab The Bhamla Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology studies the biomechanics of different organisms. Springtails. Flamingos. Worms. But they don't stop there. The team of biophysicists and bioengineers then shares those discoveries on their gorgeous website along with a companion comic. The comics are the brain child of Saad Bhamla, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and principle investigator of the lab. Since 2020, he's sought to broaden the reach of his lab's research through simple language and colorful illustrations. \"No kid ever would go to Current Biology dot org and actually download and read a research paper. [When I started this], there was this lingering feeling that there has to be a better way to share this beautiful discovery,\" Bhamla told NPR's Short Wave podcast. Sponsor Message The series is called The Curious Zoo of Extraordinary Organisms and has over a dozen comics so far. The series has earned the lab attention throughout the scientific community and is supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER grant . A favorite comic of Bhamla's son describes how an insect \u2014 called the glassy-winged sharpshooter \u2014 uses super propulsion to fling away urine that would otherwise stick to its body. The urine moves through the air 40 times faster than a cheetah accelerates. Enlarge this image The first comic created by the Bhamla Lab was about the slingshot spider. Illustrated by Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab hide caption toggle caption Illustrated by Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab The first comic created by the Bhamla Lab was about the slingshot spider. Illustrated by Lindsey Leigh/Bhamla Lab Studying the organisms is worth more than a few fun facts. Bhamla says researching the biomechanisms of organisms can directly inspire technology for humans. \"We think we can learn a trick or two from the sharpshooter and improve the ability of low power electronics to eject water from tiny crevices and areas, using very minimal energy,\" Bhamla said. At a time when the validity of much scientific research is being called into question, his lab's basic science research is also a helpful connection point with the broader public. Personally, he's bonded with non-scientists over a shared love of animals. The comics are an accessible, joyful touch point. \"I think, sometimes, it takes stepping out of these ivory towers that scientists put themselves in, writing these fancy journals that really exclude, you know, taxpayers, my neighbors who pay for this,\" Bhamla says. \"I think a little bit onus is on us to step out of our comfort zone and not underestimate the average American. I think they're resilient, curious and perhaps sometimes we hold ourselves back.\" Sponsor Message Check out more comics at the Bhamla Lab's website . Want to hear more about nature's superpowers?

Key Updates and Issues - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer Apple\u2019s iOS 18.5 beta 1 introduces a blend of incremental updates and ongoing challenges, reflecting the company\u2019s continuous efforts to refine its software ecosystem. While the release brings some noteworthy enhancements, it also raises questions about stability, performance, and user satisfaction. The video below from Zollotech examines the key features, user feedback, and broader implications of iOS 18.5, alongside updates across Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Watch this video on YouTube . Key Features: What\u2019s New and What\u2019s Not The first beta of iOS 18.5 delivers several minor updates aimed at improving the user experience. These include: Refinements to the Apple Care and Warranty interface, making it easier to access and understand device coverage details. Improved functionality in the Photos app, offering smoother navigation and better organization tools. Enhanced settings in the Mail app, allowing for more customization and streamlined email management. However, persistent issues continue to affect the overall experience. Users have reported: CarPlay connectivity bugs that disrupt seamless integration with vehicles. Micro-stutters during navigation, which detract from the smoothness of the interface. Wallpaper dimming glitches that interfere with visual consistency. Performance inconsistencies, such as occasional lag and battery drain, remain a concern. While beta versions are inherently experimental, these recurring problems highlight areas where Apple\u2019s software development process could improve. The balance between introducing new features and maintaining system stability remains a critical challenge. User Feedback: A Mixed Bag of Experiences Your experience with iOS 18.5 beta 1 may vary depending on your device model and usage patterns. Some users have reported positive changes, such as improved battery life and smoother app performance. Others, however, have encountered significant issues, including: CarPlay failures that disrupt in-car functionality. App refresh problems, leading to delays in retrieving updated content. Random stuttering during general use, affecting the overall fluidity of the system. Inconsistent battery performance remains a common complaint, with some users resorting to frequent device reboots to address slowdowns. While the beta demonstrates potential, these challenges suggest that further refinements are necessary before the official release. Apple\u2019s ability to address these issues will likely influence user satisfaction with the final version. Siri\u2019s Struggles: A Voice Assistant in Transition Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, continues to face scrutiny for its perceived limitations. Lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada allege that Apple overstated Siri\u2019s capabilities, while internal reports suggest a lack of clear direction in its development. Despite these challenges, speculation about iOS 19 hints at potential improvements to Siri, including enhanced stability and functionality. The voice assistant\u2019s struggles highlight a broader issue within Apple\u2019s ecosystem: the need for consistent innovation that meets user expectations. Whether the rumored updates in iOS 19 will address these concerns remains uncertain, but they represent an opportunity for Apple to rebuild confidence in Siri\u2019s capabilities. Expanding the Apple Ecosystem Apple continues to enhance its broader ecosystem with updates that aim to improve usability and accessibility. Recent developments include: Satellite connectivity expansion to New Zealand and Japan, offering improved global communication options for users in remote areas. Apple Maps accessibility on multiple browsers, including Safari, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, allowing greater cross-platform usability. Inclusion of iPhone 16E parts in Apple\u2019s self-service repair program, empowering users to perform their own repairs and reduce reliance on third-party services. These updates reflect Apple\u2019s commitment to broadening its ecosystem while addressing user needs. By focusing on cross-platform compatibility and user empowerment, Apple is positioning itself as a leader in creating a cohesive and versatile digital environment. Third-Party App Updates: WhatsApp and Instagram Third-party apps within Apple\u2019s ecosystem are also evolving to meet user demands. Recent updates include: WhatsApp\u2019s introduction of encrypted chats, improved group chat features, and smoother video calls, prioritizing secure and efficient communication. Instagram\u2019s reported development for iPad, addressing a long-standing user request for a dedicated app, though no official release date has been announced. These updates underscore the growing importance of third-party apps in enhancing the Apple user experience. By supporting app developers and fostering innovation, Apple strengthens its ecosystem and ensures that users have access to innovative tools and features. Performance and Battery Life: Persistent Concerns Battery life remains a critical concern for many users. While iOS 18.4 delivered mixed results, iOS 18.5 beta 1 shows slight thermal improvements but inconsistent battery performance. Benchmarks indicate stable performance overall, yet some users report slowdowns that require reboots to resolve. These issues highlight the need for Apple to optimize power management and system efficiency in future updates. As battery life continues to be a top priority for users, addressing these concerns will be essential for maintaining satisfaction and trust in Apple\u2019s products. Balancing Innovation and Stability As an iOS user, you may have noticed growing concerns about Apple\u2019s software quality. Some argue that Android offers greater stability, prompting calls for Apple to prioritize reliability and transparency. Striking a balance between innovation and stability remains a key challenge for Apple as it seeks to meet user expectations. By addressing persistent issues and focusing on delivering a seamless user experience, Apple can reinforce its reputation as a leader in technology. The company\u2019s ability to navigate this balance will likely shape its future success and influence its standing in the competitive tech landscape.

Despite hopes for deregulation, Trump\u2019s appointees remain committed to scrutinising tech giants. AI companies like Nvidia and Microsoft are also under investigation. Navbharat Times The Trump administration isn't letting up on the tech giants. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission will face off with Meta in court over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. And on April 21, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should force Google to sell its Chrome web browser to limit the power of its search monopoly. Both cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Donald Trump's first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google's ad technology business. Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and setting proactive regulations for tech. But so far, Trump's appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry's hopes. Live Events \"I think that they may not have fully focused on how much the first Trump presidency had to do with setting in motion this reexamination of tech ,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Here's what to know. Who is in charge of antitrust enforcement now? Trump appointed Andrew Ferguson as chair of the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints. \"I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we've got going,\" Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast \"Odd Lots\" this year. The new leader of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Gail Slater, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Trump's first term. She has also pledged to enforce antitrust laws aggressively. \"It's now a bipartisan issue, and there's a consensus around the need for robust antitrust enforcement,\" Slater said at an event hosted this month by Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup accelerator, which has pushed for more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. Where do the major antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants stand? Five government cases accuse tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies, and all are moving through the courts. The companies deny the allegations. The FTC sued Meta in 2020, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 violated the law by using what regulators call a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate its nascent rivals. The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The Justice Department sued Google in 2020 over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a roughly three-week hearing on how to address Google's monopoly. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal. The Justice Department accused Google in 2023 of illegally dominating the advertising technology business. A federal judge heard arguments in that case last year, and a ruling is expected soon. The FTC accused Amazon in a 2023 lawsuit of squeezing small merchants that use its marketplace to sell to consumers. A federal judge rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case last year. It is scheduled to go to trial next year. The Justice Department sued Apple last year over claims that the company's interwoven ecosystem of technology makes it hard for consumers to ditch their iPhones and iPads . Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. What about tech industry mergers and acquisitions? The Biden administration tried and failed to block numerous tech deals, including Meta's purchase of a small virtual reality startup, Within. The push to stop acquisitions outraged investors who back small companies that want to cash out by being acquired by a tech giant. Trump's appointees say they want to get out of the way of acquisitions that don't present a competitive problem. Slater has expressed an openness to companies' proposing settlements -- such as selling off similar assets -- which can help resolve concerns about deals. In late January, the Justice Department sued to block the business software company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper Networks, a networking firm, for $14 billion. It was the first lawsuit to challenge a tech deal in Trump's second term. During the first Trump administration, the Justice Department unsuccessfully challenged AT&T's purchase of Time Warner. What does this mean for the artificial intelligence race? Last year, the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide up responsibility for investigating whether the biggest players in artificial intelligence were violating antitrust laws. The Justice Department started investigating Nvidia , while the FTC took Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI. It is unclear whether those investigations will result in lawsuits. The Trump administration has promised to clear the way for American companies to develop AI, including rescinding a Biden-era executive order that put guardrails on the use of the technology. The administration has solicited the industry's input on how best to move forward with policy around the technology, an opening that companies and investors took to lobby for fewer rules. \"I think it is extremely important that we protect competition in the AI space, but I think it is equally important that the government not race to regulate AI,\" Ferguson said on Bloomberg TV in March.

Photograph: Richard Brooks / AFP via Getty Images Arjun Neil Alim Steff Ch\u00e1vez Mon Apr 14 2025 - 16:20 US stocks gave back early gains on Monday afternoon as markets remained on edge over Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies despite new lenience over the weekend on electronics tariffs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up only slightly, after climbing 1.7 per cent and 2.3 per cent higher in morning trading, respectively. Equities ceded earlier gains as Trump spoke about US border policies and aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia while fielding questions in the Oval Office. \u201cThe markets have been very strong once they got used to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI gave them a little bit of a pause, because, you know, you have to show a little flexibility, but we go back to what we have to do.\u201d READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home New research highlights wealth divide between North and South Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football European stocks made strong gains, as the Trump administration\u2019s proposed tariff exemptions offered investors hope of some relief in the trade war. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 gained 2.7 per cent on Monday, while the UK\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 2.1 per cent. The European rally was broad based, with banking stocks posting the biggest gains. But investors are far from confident that the volatile market moves are over. \u201cGains like today can evaporate quite quickly, so we\u2019re quite cautious,\u201d said Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much longevity I\u2019ll give [the rally],\u201d he added. \u201cWho knows what the next announcement will be.\u201d The gains came after the White House late on Friday excluded smartphones and other consumer electronics from steep tariffs introduced this month. On Sunday, however, administration officials warned that the reprieve would be temporary. Mr Trump\u2019s erratic tariff swerves have driven huge volatility in markets in recent weeks, with his decision last Wednesday to pause \u201creciprocal\u201d levies on most countries other than China sparking a huge rally in US equities. \u201cWhile uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariffs is far from over, we think the pause [on key tech products] indicates a sensitivity to market stress from the administration,\u201d said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. Technology stocks had earlier led the advance, with Apple\u2019s share price jumping 7.5 per cent at the market open in the US, losing some of those gains to trade at 5.3 per cent higher by mid-morning in New York. Mr Trump and Howard Lutnick, US commerce secretary, on Sunday indicated that consumer electronics would instead be subject to a separate duty the White House was preparing for semiconductors. It was unclear what level the chips tariffs would be set at, but other duties the Trump administration has imposed on individual sectors such as steel and aluminium suggest they could be substantially lower than the levies currently imposed on China. The early lift in US markets followed earlier gains in Europe and Asia. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 gained 2.5 per cent by afternoon trading in Europe, while the UK\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 2 per cent. Dutch chipmakers Besi and ASML were up 4.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively by the afternoon in Europe. In comments to journalists on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said his administration would show \u201cflexibility\u201d for some products and signalled that it would be speaking to key companies to discuss the tariffs. Asked what the semiconductor levy rate would be, he told reporters he would \u201cbe announcing it over the next week\u201d. Mr Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, announced at a \u201cliberation day\u201d event this month, unleashed turmoil across financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession. But stocks rallied at the end of the week, after Trump\u2019s decision to put a 90-day pause on big \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for most countries fed optimism that the worst-case trade scenario could be avoided. The prospect of lower tariffs on popular consumer electronics would be a boost for Apple and other tech groups that rely heavily on Chinese factories to make iPhones and other goods. \u201cWe might be past peak tariff fear,\u201d said Michael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, adding that the new exemptions were a \u201creasonably significant backing off\u201d on the level of tariffs expected at the end of last week. Haven assets were steady. Gold touched a fresh record high of just over $3,245 per troy ounce on Monday morning, before giving up its gains. Markets in Asia rebounded, led by Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index up 2.4 per cent, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rising 1.2 per cent and the broad Topix up 0.9 per cent. China\u2019s mainland CSI 300 rose 0.2 per cent as official data showed exports from the world\u2019s second-largest economy leapt last month amid a rush to dispatch shipments before tariffs took effect. Exports rose 12.4 per cent in US dollar terms in March on a year earlier, figures from China\u2019s customs administration showed on Monday, well above expectations and the biggest rise since October. Imports fell 4.3 per cent, a less steep contraction than the 8.4 per cent fall in the January-February period. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Donald Trump US tariffs IN THIS SECTION Zuckerberg says Meta has more competitors than FTC claims New research highlights wealth divide between North and South Why is Ireland-US tourist data going south?

Written by David Delima | Updated: 14 April 2025 12:02 IST Photo Credit: Apple Apple Vision Pro (pictured) was unveiled by the company in 2023 Highlights Apple Vision Pro 2 could be launched with a major change in functionality The company is also said to be working on a more affordable refresh The mixed reality headset may succeed the two-year-old Vision Pro model Advertisement Apple Vision Pro 2 is in the works with support for 'high-end enterprise applications' and low latency connectivity, according to Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman. The Cupertino company is said to be working on the successor to its first generation Vision Pro mixed reality headset that went on sale in the US and other countries last year. Meanwhile, Apple is also reportedly developing a refreshed version of the Vision Pro that will be more affordable and lighter than the first model. Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be Tethered to Mac Computer Unlike the first generation Apple Vision Pro, which is a wireless mixed reality headset, the second generation spatial computer from Apple will be tethered to a Mac computer, Gurman writes in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter. This is likely to be the biggest change in terms of functionality, according to the journalist. The wired connection is said to deliver low latency connectivity that can enable support for advanced enterprise applications, or even stream the contents of a Mac's display on the Vision Pro 2. Apple was previously working on a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses \u2014 also tethered to a Mac computer \u2014 but that project has reportedly been scrapped in favour of the Apple Vision Pro 2. Apple Vision Pro 2 Reportedly Enters Production According to Gurman, Apple is also working on a refreshed version of the first generation Vision Pro model, which is lighter. The company's first mixed reality headset can weigh between 600g and 650g, without the external battery pack. The refreshed model is also expected to be cheaper than the Vision Pro, which costs $3,500 (roughly Rs. 3.01 lakh). Meta's most expensive mixed reality headset costs $500 (roughly Rs. 43,100), which is much lower, and Apple could be working on a cheaper refresh to compete with the Meta Quest 3. Apple Intelligence Comes to Apple Vision Pro With visionOS 2.4 Update Apple Shuffles AI Executive Ranks in Bid to Turn Around Siri Apple Intelligence Features in the Vision Pro Might Arrive by April Earlier this month, a report claimed that Apple would launch the Vision Pro 2 model later this year, and that components for the headset were already in production. Given the lacklustre sales of the first-generation Apple Vision Pro and the ongoing uncertainty related to tariffs, it remains to be seen how Apple keeps up demand for the Vision Pro 2, if it is launched in the coming months.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Taken from CNBC\u2019s Daily Open, our international markets newsletter \u2014 Subscribe today On late Friday, the Trump administration welcomed the weekend in the best way: by announcing that electronics \u2014 such as smartphones, computers and semiconductors \u2014 will be temporarily exempted from his so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs, including the baseline 10% rate on all countries. That means such products imported from China will apparently not be subjected to the 125% tariff U.S. President Donald Trump slapped on Beijing (a 20% tariff will remain). Apple CEO Tim Cook must be heaving a sigh of relief: The Cupertino-based company manufactures around 80% of iPads and more than half of Mac computers in China , according to an estimate from Evercore ISI. The news is also a relief for consumers, who desperately need an uplift in mood, based on the findings of the University of Michigan's latest survey . After all, it's not just corporations and importers that are affected by tariffs. Laptop prices have already shot up, according to disgruntled comments on Reddit. The Nintendo Switch 2 preorder was postponed . Perhaps even Trump is keeping in mind the famous Wall Street adage: Don't bet against the U.S. consumer. What you need to know today Tech exempted from tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from his reciprocal tariffs, according to guidance issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday evening. However, Trump and his aides on Sunday suggested those exemptions would be partially or completely reversed in coming weeks, adding to the confusion over abrupt policy changes. U.S. markets rise amid a volatile week U.S. stocks climbed Friday to end the week on a positive note despite heavy market turbulence caused by the Trump administration's tariffs. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 5.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 5% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 7.3%. Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index popped over 2%, leading gains in the region. Japan's Nikkei 225 added more than 1.6%. Consumers in the U.S. are really downcast Consumer sentiment in April sank further , according to the University of Michigan 's survey. It posted a mid-month reading of 50.8 \u2014 the lowest since June 2022 and the second lowest in the survey's history going back to 1952 \u2014 below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 54.6. At the same time, respondents' expectation for inflation a year from now leaped to 6.7%, the highest level since November 1981 and up from 5% in March. 'Very close' to a recession BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday told CNBC that he thinks \" we're very close, if not in, a recession now .\" However, Fink said he did not think the U.S. was in a financial crisis and expects \"megatrends\" like artificial intelligence would persist.

Transcript of Interview with Tara Cremin Joanna: Tara Cremin is the director of Kobo Writing Life, Kobo's independent publishing platform. Welcome back to the show, Tara. Tara: Thanks, Jo. Thanks for having me. Joanna: Oh, it is great to have you back on the show. It's actually been four years, which is crazy. Tara: I can't believe it. Joanna: I know. So I thought we'd go back to the beginning. Tell us a bit more about you. When did you get into the book business, and what are some of the changes you've seen for authors since then? Tara: Sure. So I've been working for Kobo since 2012, which feels like a lifetime. When I started, the company had created some great, but kind of relatively simple, eReaders. They were just starting to dip their toe into really expanding what physical devices could do. Then you fast forward to 2025, and we're the second largest manufacturer of eReaders , after our friends in Seattle. So part of the work that I do on Kobo Writing Life, I've been working on it basically since day one. Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform for authors who wanted to publish directly to Kobo readers. So I've been kind of working on that. The biggest change on the author side that I can really think of is just the expansion of the tools. I think it's easy to not always think back to 2012 because things move so quickly. I'll be like, \u201cOh, that was ages ago,\u201d but it'll be like four years ago. When you're actually thinking about 2012, authors were uploading a Word doc and publishing their ebook, and then that was it. There wasn't a lot of different things available or more opportunities. Now, authors can really easily create accessible and like really beautifully designed ePubs with tools like Vellum and Atticus . They can publish audiobooks to Kobo, they can reach libraries, join subscription programs, and take advantage of all the promotional tools that are available. So I think the biggest change is just that there's more opportunities now for authors than when I started working in the book business. Joanna: Oh, and\u2014 What about the growth of Kobo for indies? I mean, we've heard before some of the stats around the number of self-published books on the Kobo platform. That's grown as well, hasn't it? Tara: It has. I have some stats for you. When we look at self-publishing on Kobo, it makes up about 25% of the units for single copy sales . Then if we think about the subscription reading, it makes up about 60% of English language subscription reading is all self-published content. It's huge . Joanna: Wow, that's incredible. So indie authors are important to Kobo, I guess we could say. Tara: Yes, and it started with somebody wanting to email a Word doc and get it published, which is why Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform. We've really been able to expand it and add additional features. Kobo has always taken a global stance of the digital book market, and I think we realized pretty early that the indie authors were really integral to that. Something that I don't think we talk about a lot because I'm primarily focused on the English language side, but we also have a portal that's just for users in Japan that's very self-contained in Japanese. Last year, we actually localized in traditional and simplified Chinese for our friends in Taiwan and Hong Kong. So the Kobo Writing Life platform is now available in eight languages. So we know how integral the independent authors are to the global book business. Joanna: Kobo originally was Canadian, right? Then it was bought by a Japanese company. Tara: Yes, so we're still headquartered in Toronto. We have a global presence, where we have offices in Taiwan, in Tokyo, Darmstadt and Dublin, and with a generous sprinkling of people throughout Europe. We were acquired by Rakuten, maybe prior to me joining, 2010, 2011, and we've been sort of their digital book area of that ever since then. So having this enormous company backing has been really, really helpful, but we do maintain quite a Canadian-centric grassroots focus with the HQ being here in Toronto . Joanna: Absolutely. So one of the changes you mentioned has been the subscription model. As you mentioned, our friends in Seattle have one that's quite famous that is an exclusive program. Kobo Plus is not exclusive, so people can be in that as well as selling their ebooks elsewhere, which I love. How does Kobo Plus subscription compare to some of the other subscription models for ebooks and audiobooks? Like, what is it for readers and listeners? Tara: Sure, I think it's maybe important to see why people have gone down the subscription route, for people that are potentially a little bit hesitant of that. So when we're thinking about the book business as a whole, or Kobo's history, I think in about 2015 we could see that there was a whole generation of consumers that were coming that were consuming most of their media by not purchasing it once at a time, and they were signing up for subscriptions . Whether this be music or movies or TV shows, I think we knew that books and audiobooks were going to go this way. As a retailer that was really doing a great job at selling books one at a time, we wanted to reach this subscription consumer without disrupting the business we had built and doing it in a way that benefited us, the publishers, the authors, but also the readers who were looking for this. So we tested this in a contained market. So it was launched back in 2017 in the Netherlands. This is because we had a really great market share there. A strong, willing partner, Bol, who wanted to test this out. One of the also key factors was that there's some of the biggest piracy rates in Europe were found in the Netherlands. So we wanted to see if we could convert those users who were already sometimes using Kobo devices. They're reading, they're just not paying for the reading. So we wanted to see if we could make this very easy, self-contained platform, could we convert them to paying users? Then what we found from that is that it really didn't cannibalize the a la carte sales. We had new customers signing up, and we could kind of see where they were coming from. Some of them were coming over from Kindle Unlimited, some of them coming from piracy. Some of them had been maybe just library users that had been moved into this kind of easier one click model. Some of them had never read an ebook before, but used it as a way to step their toe into the digital reading. What we found is that \u2014 Publishers and authors, they all earned more as a result of the new readers [on subscription]. So what we looked at with these findings was\u2014gosh, it'll be almost 10 years now, which is wild. Time doesn't exist anymore, Joanna\u2014but with the findings from the Netherlands, we've been able to expand Kobo Plus. As of this recording, we are currently in 23 countries , which is including all of our core markets. There'll be more to come, probably shortly after this comes out, actually, but I can't quite say where. So 23 countries right now. Like you've mentioned, we're not the only subscription model out there, but what makes us a little bit different is the focus on the importance of the authors and wanting to give them flexibility, while also trying to reach this subscription reader. So it was really important to us that we didn't lock any authors into exclusivity. Our ethos around KWL is really trying to encourage authors to publish widely on as many platforms as they can, to reach as many readers as they can. We just want to make sure that the Kobo experience of you publishing widely is really easy and that you're not spending too much time on it because you're balancing all of these other platforms. So we built this out so authors can pick and choose the country. They can choose all of them if they want, which is what I would always recommend. If you're a wide author that's publishing globally, I don't know why you wouldn't put your books in, but perhaps you didn't want to hit up your main markets, like the US or Canada. You do have the option of like excluding those, or you can select all of them. What's a cool way about selecting all of them is that it actually includes future territories. So as we've been rapidly expanding Kobo Plus, you don't have to do anything. Your books are already there when we add to new places. So that's been pretty cool. We're not locking authors into any timed period. You can put your books in, and you can take them out if you're not happy with it. I always encourage people to leave them in, to really try to reach that readership. Again, we wanted to give authors as much control as possible, and really just get authors to try it out. Like try out an older series, maybe try it out in the Netherlands, where you haven't really thought about selling books before, and eventually get really comfortable adding their catalog to Kobo plus. So for us, it was really all about building author trust over time when it comes to subscriptions . I feel people are more comfortable with it now than before, and I think it's easy to get people comfortable when the revenue is increasing, I think. Joanna: So all my books that are on Kobo are in Kobo Plus . I also agree, I think there's a group of readers for whom\u2014readers and listeners, we should say\u2014because this is audiobooks as well, right? Tara: Yes, it is. Depending on the territory, but primarily they all have ebooks and audiobooks. So from a customer perspective, you can either pay for all you can read for a month, all you can listen for a month, or all you can read and listen. So those are the options. Joanna: Exactly. So this is the thing, I think as authors, we have to think about different groups of readers. So even as we record this, I've got a Kickstarter happening. There is an ebook, there is an audiobook, which will eventually be on Kobo, but for now, they're just on Kickstarter. Then there's a gorgeous hardback with foil and ribbon and all of that kind of thing, which Kobo doesn't sell beautiful hardbacks, right? I mean, and neither does Amazon, neither does Apple. [The special hardback vs subscription.] They're different audiences. It's a completely different audience, someone who's going to buy that hardback to someone who's going to borrow the audiobook in the Netherlands. Tara: Yes. I mean, I love seeing what authors are doing with these. That must be so satisfying for you to get that copy of this beautiful book. So, yes, we really wanted to just focus on the digital experience, especially when it comes to our devices as well. We make some of the best e-reading devices\u2014I mean, I would say they are the best\u2014but like, we're making the best eReaders that are available. We launched our first color eReaders last year, and the reception to them was just tremendous. So our eReaders have integration with ebooks and audiobooks . You can connect via Bluetooth to speakers or headphones. We also have Overdrive capabilities, like Overdrive is built into the e reader, so you can access the library from within Kobo. One of the things that we've been doing, l think we've just launched it maybe last year. You can tell I don't work on the device side, I'm not quite as sharp with my dates. It's always been very important for us to have it be this open platform. So having users be able to just use the eReader to read books, and if we can make it easy for them to purchase books with subscriptions and convert them to paying users, that's awesome, but we do have integration with Dropbox. With our newer eReaders, you can actually write notes with the Kobo Stylist, and you can mark up the files themselves, and there's integration within that. We've recently added Google Drive integration, which is super easy. I just used it the other day when I was giving a presentation, and I had my notes that I was able to convert over and read from my Kobo, which was really helpful. I was actually able to mark up and make changes as I'm going along on the Kobo eReader itself, which is pretty cool. Joanna: Of course, if people buy my ebook from the Kickstarter, they can read that on Kobo because it doesn't have to be like DRMed into \u2014that's too technical. It doesn't have to be a specifically Kobo ebook is what you're saying. Tara: No, no, no. We always just use the ePub standard. Actually, I shouldn't be saying that because you can also add PDFs and things like that. So, no, it's not a locked system. Joanna: I think that's really good too. So let's get into some of the other things. I mean, like we mentioned, the gorgeous hardbacks that are the current trend in the indie community. I mean, they really are kind of all people are talking about. You and I were talking about doing this episode because at the end of the day \u2014 The bread and butter income for most indie authors is still digital. It's like, we move on to the sexiest thing. In 2012 ebooks were pretty sexy, right? I mean, they were like, \u201cOh, we can do this, and we can do this.\u201d Then it was audiobooks and print-on-demand and all of that, and now it's gorgeous hardbacks. So let's just go back in to the sort of bread and butter. What are your tips for maximizing income from ebooks and audiobooks on Kobo? I know that's a massive question, but let's pick a few things. Tara: I think it's still really important to make beautiful books, even if it's digital . I mean because authors are primarily digital first. A lot of publishers are not. They're still really focused on the print. So I think it's really important to think about making a really great digital file, which, like I mentioned, it's just easier than ever now. You actually don't even have to think about it that much, the tools just do it for you. I think it's important to have a file that can be read easily because the last thing we want to do is have some sort of technical glitch that is interrupting somebody's hard won reading time. We really just want the person to be always trying to get the next book, so making sure the file itself is beautiful and working perfectly, I think is really important. I think it's important to consider making accessible files so that everyone can read your book . Digital reading opens up a world to people that might have limitations around physical book reading. There are a number of people that can only read digitally, and it just allows for a more inclusive reading experience. So something to be mindful of as well. Joanna: Just on that\u2014 Is there something special we need to do for accessibility for an ebook? Tara: So I have a book recommendation for everyone called Content For Everyone , by Jeff Adams and Michele Lucchini. We had them on the Kobo Writing Life Podcast, and it was just a great conversation. I would say to check out their book because it has a lot of practical advice for authors on making accessible content. So not even just the ebooks themselves, but also author websites and newsletters. It's really full of actionable tips. They are far more versed in this than I would be to try and reiterate some of their stuff. Joanna: Jeff's been on this show, and we talked about it then . I got the impression that if you use, let's say, Vellum or Atticus for your ebook publishing, that does cover the content, at least, of an ebook. Tara: Yes, yes, perfect. Joanna: Okay, great. So just to be clear, there wasn't anything extra we were missing. Tara: No, no. Just to make sure that that is kind of being done, and you're not creating files that are inaccessible. Joanna: Which, to me, it means that Kobo is still getting a ton of badly formatted files, which I thought we were way past that. Tara: It's not that it's badly formatted, I think you have to consider the millions of books that exist, and especially the older catalog. So newer books might be accessible, but the older books that you've created back in 2012 might not be. So a lot of the work we're doing is just an education around making sure that your book files are of the best content or the best quality that they can be, like before vellum existed. Joanna: Oh, yes. I used to use Scrivener back in the day. I know some people still do, but Scrivener, I used to get errors all the time. I love Scrivener for writing, but for listeners, I would say Vellum or Atticus is the best in class these days. Okay, back on to maximizing income. Tara: So I would say that \u2014 For Kobo, box sets are super popular. So when you're thinking about selling books one at a time, and authors primarily are writing in series, or that's sort of the trend that we see through Kobo Writing Life, you definitely want to bundle your books. Something to remember is that on Kobo, we don't have a higher price cap . So you can go over $9.99, and still earn 70% on each sale. So with the box sets, again, you want to make sure that you have an easy to navigate table of contents because this is a larger file that readers are browsing through. So you want to make sure that they're able to do that with ease. Which I'm sure, again, these tools can kind of easily create this for you, but just something to be mindful of when you're bundling the books together. Joanna: Yes. I think bringing up box sets is really good because the KWL promotion tab i s great. I go in every three weeks, and I apply for as much as I can get. Although, just so everyone knows, I don't get every promotion. Like nobody gets every promotion, right? You just have to apply for a ton of them. There are always box set promotions going on. Tara: Yes, we rotate around pretty regularly with them because our readers are just so interested in having box sets. It's funny because I think we think about box sets as like a discounted opportunity to have these books, but that's not really how readers are taking them. They're taking them as like this is a convenient way to have this one series in this one book . So I'd always recommend pricing them for their value and just making sure that they're available for the reader who doesn't want to like click on books one by one, and just have this bigger box set. Something to keep in mind with the covers is that we do accept the 3D box sets with the plain white backgrounds, but if you're thinking about promotions or applying to promotions, we might be a little bit less inclined to accept those, just because it makes your cover really small and it makes it harder to read. You already have limited space on a website in terms of a cover, so I really like to \u2014 Think of box set covers as they're almost as an ad for your series. So you can kind of use it as an opportunity to encapsulate the theme of your series within your box set cover. Joanna: Then just on that, just on Kobo Plus, we didn't say\u2014So a lot of authors are used to the \u2018pages read' idea. How is that done on Kobo Plus for reading and listening? Tara: The biggest difference, I guess, between Kobo Plus and some of the other platforms is that we base our payment on\u2014well, it's a very similar revenue share model\u2014but it's based on the minutes that your book has been read versus the page reads. This allows us to treat ebooks and audiobooks the same, and it kind of reduces a little bit of the gamification that we've seen on some other platforms . So we're really taking into account the time that somebody is spending on your book. Joanna: Yes, because some people were able to game other systems by sort of getting bots or paying people to click through pages and stuff like that. Oh, but it's funny, isn't it? I mean, whenever humans can find a way to game a system, they will. Tara: We're very clever people. Joanna: We are. We are very clever people. Okay, so\u2014 What about some other ways of maximizing income? Tara: So I would say with audiobooks that we're talking about, so you can publish audiobooks to Kobo as well, through Kobo Writing Life. You may not see the tab right away, and actually the same with the promotions tab, but you just have to send the team an email to enable this for you. If you email writinglife@kobo.com you can ask for audiobooks and for promotions. Just as we were talking about the box set covers there, I think something to keep in mind with audiobooks, we will crop the cover for you. If you want to make sure that you're making the best cover, audiobooks are square and not rectangular, so sometimes we do see kind of like a really squished cover. That would just be something to be a bit mindful of when you're publishing audiobooks, to just make sure that you're selling the book because we are unfortunately always judging books by their covers. Joanna: Yes, absolutely. I guess\u2014 One of the things I've noticed with Kobo is that the vast majority of my Kobo income is fiction rather than nonfiction. Is there a split like that? Tara: There probably is, but I feel like the nonfiction market for us is definitely growing, especially with our new devices. We've done a lot of work to try to cater to the nonfiction reader, and what we call like an immersive reading experience. You can see this with the writing within the book itself. There's easy ways to flip back and forth between the pages. We basically have the digital version of like a thumb in the side of the pages, so you don't lose your spot, but you can actually flip through the book and then flip back again. So it's definitely growing, but I think what we see, especially on Kobo Writing Life, it would be fiction that would be primarily what people are reading right now . Joanna: Well, I'll put another sort of ask in for the promotional tab, which is mainly fiction focused, I find. I do always look for nonfiction promotions there. To be clear, again, for people listening, I do think to sell books on Kobo, it is good to be part of the promotional opportunities . You can really get in front of new readers that way. So that would be one of the things I would like to see, is more nonfiction and memoir promotional opportunities. Tara: For sure. I will take this to the team. Joanna: Yes. Take the feedback! Let's talk about libraries because some authors are worried about libraries. I mean, obviously authors want libraries to have their ebooks and audiobooks, but they're also worried about the money. If an author goes with the library and Overdrive, how do they get paid for that? Tara: So it's really easy to opt your books in. It's part of the publication process, so it's in the rights and distribution section. So you just have to set a price in USD, and that'll be your library price for the book . The general rule of thumb is roughly around the same as a mass market paperback. You just want to make sure that you're not putting the same price as your just straight up digital book because of the loaning factor when it comes to the library books. Sometimes we have authors that want to appeal to libraries by putting it in at a lower price, and I always kind of remind them that the librarians have two ways of purchasing the books through Kobo Writing Life. So they can publish on a one copy, one user. This is kind of like when you think of a traditional book, that we have this one book and that can be loaned out multiple times. So that's why you want to increase the price because you want to cover the loans that are happening with that. They also have the opportunity to buy your book on a cost per checkout option, and that's for a one-time loan for 10% of the price. So if your library book is $19.99, they could also just buy your book for a one-time loan for $1.99. So that can really appeal to them. We have a lot of the library sales that are demand driven, so it's people actually going in and asking for your book. So it's really great to be able to offer to a librarian, like actually, you can buy it just this one time, and maybe you'll buy it a few times for the lower price. Then if it's really popular, then you'll buy it for the higher price again. So we see that happening quite a lot. Authors that distribute to Overdrive through Kobo, they earn 50% of any sale that happens. Joanna: Yes. So just to put people's mind at ease \u2014 You can support libraries and get paid. So this is one of the ways you can say to people, you can listen or read my books for free. Just ask the librarian to stock them, or just go to your library app. I think that's a good one. I wanted to come on to the authors who do really well on KWL. What are the commonalities that you see amongst top selling authors? What do you see working that we can model? Tara: Well, like you've mentioned, the promotions tool that we have. I was trying to think about instances of authors that have moved widely in the past couple of years and are finding success on Kobo, and they're honestly the ones that have leveraged their promotions. It can take a little while to build a Kobo audience , and I just always recommend applying to the promotions that are relevant to your books and applying regularly. I like to think about it as, like, the worst case scenario is that you're putting your books in front of the right eyes. It can just be quite competitive because there's a lot of people applying, but it's our merchandising team that are going through them. So I definitely would say the ones that are building the audience and finding success on Kobo are really leveraging the promotions with us. Then also, that's audio and library promotions that we have too. I think if you're publishing audiobooks, and I know this can be really tricky to balance, but if you can make sure that you're publishing your ebook and your audiobook on the same day and do those same releases, I think that's really important to building sales. We found authors that have kind of reported that it's a bigger impact for their audio when they do that versus when they release it at a later date or anything. So you can try and line them up as the one book release. Joanna: Well, then that brings me on to something, having obviously done audiobooks for many years. Sometimes I narrate them myself, sometimes I have paid people, but recently, and in fact, my Death Valley audiobook \u2014I haven't told you this\u2014but it is narrated by my voice clone, my AI voice clone . Today, as we record this, I put a couple of chapters up on The Creative Penn Podcast, so people can have a listen. I've already had comments that say, \u201cI would not have known this was an AI. It sounds exactly like you.\u201d This will be, I think, the first time in however long I've been doing this now, 2007, I've been able to publish ebook and audiobook on the same day. Tara: Oh, wow. Joanna: Because, as you said, it is incredibly hard to do that because most of us, in the past, we've maybe sold the ebook first, made some money, then eventually been able to pay for the audiobook. Before Kobo, when you could put it up there, you put them on another platform, they never went live on the same day. There was a long time we couldn't do preorders. So, I guess we're coming onto the AI discussion because AI-narrated audiobooks, certainly for me, ElevenLabs, the difference in the amount of work and pain for me as an audiobook narrator is incredible. So I don't know if I'm ever going to human-narrate again. I mean, it literally is fantastic. So let's come on to AI. What is Kobo's stance on AI-assisted ebooks, AI-narrated audiobooks, AI-created covers? I know this is a tough question, but we have to cover it. Tara: AI is definitely the biggest thing that is disrupting the book industry at the moment. When it comes to us at Kobo, we kind of go back to the core principles of what makes a reader's life worse, and can we avoid it? And what makes a reader's life better, and can we take advantage of it? So AI, we know, will open the floodgates to lots of books being published that are like purely machine generated, which really impacts organic discovery, especially for indies. Part of the upside of this is that it becomes a curation problem, and that's something that we're here for . We're here to solve that problem. So with Kobo Writing Life specifically, we accept AI audiobooks, and we just ask that they're clearly labeled that it's machine read. It's really just a customer expectation or just have something that's mentioning that it's a machine read audiobook. We do discourage the publication of ebooks that are solely generated by AI, and this is just trying to root out the bad actors . We're not trying to root out any authors who are serious about making a career with their works, but we're just trying to discourage the people that are bad actors within this space. So when we think about it from an indie author perspective, I think it's good practice to include disclosure, which I think is something that you do, Joanna. I think of you as like a leader in the best practices in this space. Joanna: I do try. Just on the audiobook, so I have a button, like a yellow button, that says \u201cdigitally narrated.\u201d It's so funny because I see now in the traditional publishing industry they're saying, \u201cOh, we need labeling,\u201d and I'm like, I've been labeling my books for years. I mean, come on. Like before it was required, I ticked all the boxes and talked about it. Also, I don't have an issue with that. I think honesty is really important. Also, I feel like all these things make my work better. I'm not doing it to try to scam anyone or be worse. I'm trying to be better. I do think, though, we are in a transition period. I think this will be so pervasive within a year or two that it won't make that much difference. For now, I guess, as you say, it's marking this. So I will be filling in whatever I need to fill in. Tara: Yes, I think it's good practice. I mean, it is a personal decision, and I think you just have to think about the reader. You just don't want to disappoint the person that is buying your book. Like, that's what it ultimately comes down to for us. Then we also know that it's okay to use AI as a tool, especially with indie authors who have to balance writing with the entire business of also being your own publisher. So whether you're using it as a tool to create you a calendar or spreadsheet that makes sure that you're hitting all your preorder dates. There's things that can make your life easier because you have to wear so many hats. So we understand that as well. So when I think about AI, like from a book selling perspective, I think the interesting opportunity comes in how we can leverage AI in some of our recommendations, like summarizations and curation . So I can't really go into too much detail on what we're working on yet, but we're really excited about better recommendations and curation that really benefit us all. We just want to keep people's attention on long form reading by putting really good stuff in front of them, and we can do this without using books as training data inside an LLM. So, yes, we're excited about this. Any Kobo Writing Life authors that are listening, you can expect some changes for to the Kobo Writing Life terms to come. I hope that things aren't seen as anything that's too scary. We're really trying to just support some new initiatives and be really, really clear about what we're asking for. We're not interested in making new content. We don't want to make things from books that authors entrust us with. What we do want to do is make reading better and keep people reading more and for longer. We're trying to earn a space in reading amongst everything else that's going on in the digital world, and we really believe that we can do this. Joanna: Yes, I like that. It's interesting, though, because you mentioned there about\u2014and this is obviously important\u2014that you're not going to just upload everyone's books to some big LLM and do stuff with it. You're not going to do that. It's funny because for many, many years, I've said, \u2018why is the book itself not the metadata?' So we've had to come up with categories, keywords. We've had to have genre-specific covers. The thing is, if I have a book, say Death Valley \u2014it's like 70,000 words, it's a full length thriller\u2014and I have to write a sales description, which is\u2014well, in fact, Claude writes my sales descriptions now\u2014but it's not long enough. What you want with some kind of AI curation recommendation engine is the emotional promise of this, the characters in this, the feeling you get by reading this, matches these books over here, which just will not be surfaced in a normal book recommendation engine. In fact, for the last year or so\u2014 I've been using ChatGPT as my main book recommendation engine because it can do this much more nuanced search. I found really some quite old books as well have come up. So is that something that\u2014I know you're not going to read everything in\u2014but what do you think about that? Tara: I think you're spot on in the kind of way that the book recommendations can be going and can be leveraged. We just want to make more thoughtful recommendations. It's interesting that you're saying that it's older books too, because that's something that we see with the subscription with Kobo Plus when I look at some of the top read books. They're often coming from like 2017, 2018. So there's ways to resurface things that exist that people want to read . We can do this in a thoughtful way and an easier way than us having to rely on metadata that's been provided. If I want to be able to find a list of like Canadian authors, it's not as easy as potentially it can be. There's instances like that. It's all about, again, trying to find the right book for the right reader and just keeping them reading . That's what we're focused on. Joanna: At the end of the day, I mean, we're book people, and it kind of drives me up the wall when authors get annoyed with other authors. I'm like, look, let's get upset about how much time people spend gaming or how much time people to spend on TV. We just want everyone to read. Whatever they read is good. We just want people to read books. I know, obviously, that's what Kobo wants as well. Tara: I think it was like on Threads or a meme or something that I read recently, where it was like, reading is almost radical now . In a time where we just want faster content and we're consuming things faster, it's a bit radical to be like, actually, I'm going to sit down for two hours and just be immersed in this world and really think about myself and expand my thoughts on other things because I'm not going to be distracted by four things at once. It must have been some meme that, ironically, grabbed my attention for this radical thought process. Joanna: That's ironic. Tara: I know, but I was just like, that's right. It's something that we don't do. I mean, it's, I guess, comparable to going to the movies and like actually sitting there and not being distracted. It's the same sort of thing where it's radical to take that time for yourself, and we want people to be able to do that. Joanna: We're almost out of time, but I just wanted us to mention the Kobo Writing Life Podcast. Since this is a podcast, people might enjoy the KWL Show, and that has been going for many years now. What can people find over on the KWL Podcast if they want to click over and have a listen? Tara: We just released episode 366, which is wild. So you can find us anywhere where you listen to podcasts . We release an episode every week, but we rotate between new interviews, and then we've been resurfacing some of our great content from our backlist with a little thing we're calling the Kobo Rewriting Life Podcast. So there'll be a new episode, a Rewriting Life new episode, and so on and so forth. There's a wealth of really good information. We focus on the craft and business of writing. It's a mix of traditional authors and indies. Jo, you've been a guest, and we'd love to have you back. I think you're going to come on soon. Joanna: Yes, at some point. Tara: I think for anyone that is interested in Kobo, or maybe you're new to what we do, at the end of 2024 we released an interview with Michael Tamblyn, who is our CEO. He is probably a little bit more eloquent than me in explaining the things that we've just talked about. He really gives a great outline of Kobo, Kobo Writing Life, and I just really like being able to spotlight that because it really informs the fact that Kobo is a book company, and we're being led by a book guy. I think that's something to be celebrated, and just kind of shows our overall focus into the reading space. Joanna: Well, we should also remind people what Kobo is an acronym for. Tara: Literally, it's the word \u2018book.' Joanna: I feel like we forget to say that because we know it, but there might be people listening who didn't know. Tara: I worked there for years before I realized that it was actually an anagram of the word book. I think I was definitely three years in before it hit me. I was like, oh, right. Joanna: Oh, yes, that's what it is. Michael Tamblyn is\u2014I've been at London Book Fair\u2014and he's often the very best speaker in publishing. I mean, he really is very entertaining and very positive about indie authors, which I really appreciate. I've heard him defend indie authors to the publishing industry. So I love that, and I'm obviously a happy KWL user. So Tara\u2014 Where can people find the Kobo Writing Life team if they want to connect? Tara: So you can email us at writinglife@kobo.com . We're on most of the socials. We haven't quite ventured into TikTok yet, but you can find us on Facebook and Instagram and Threads and YouTube. If you are interested in creating an account or learning more about it, you can go to Kobo.com/writinglife . Joanna: Brilliant. Thanks so much for your time, Tara. That was great. Tara: Thank you.

Home News You are here No price hike for Samsung Galaxy phones, at least for now By Mariyan Slavov Published: Apr 14, 2025, 2:49 AM 0 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Up Next: Things have been moving at a breakneck speed in the past couple of days regarding the tariff situation. US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most major production hubs in addition to a baseline 10% tariff on all countries. These tariffs went into effect on April 5, with China being hit the hardest with a 54% reciprocal tax on imports (later bumped up to 145%). This made people rush to Apple stores to buy iPhones before any potential price hike, but Samsung and Galaxy phones were also in danger. The Korean company manufactures most of its phones in Vietnam, and that country is now subject to a 46% tariff. After the tariffs went into effect, Trump decided to pause taxing most of the countries (except China) for 90 days after a backlash from more than 75 countries. \"Based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the [US Trade Representative], to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\" - Donald Trump, president of the United States Receive the latest Samsung news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . Now it seems that the President has had another change of heart, as he announced a tariff exemption for key electronics such as smartphones, computers, memory products, and more. So the prices of Samsung Galaxy phones most likely will remain unchanged, and this applies to other big brands as well, such as Apple and Google. OnePlus was one of the first brands to fall victim to the new tariffs , being forced to raise the price of the OnePlus Watch 3 from $329 to $499 without any explanation, but now we expect prices to return to their previous state. With tariff exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other electronics, imports from outside the US will continue to be taxed with the normal 10% flat rate, and it should be business as usual for Samsung, Apple, and the like. Which in turn is good news for customers in the States. There's yet another turn of events that suggest that this exemption for smartphones and other electronics may be only temporary , but we have to wait and see. Things are changing by the hour.

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Exports rose 12.4 per cent compared to March last year, according to official data, a bigger than expected jump that compared to a 2.3 per cent increase in the first two months of the year. The announcement came hours after the White House said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs announced on Friday was only a temporary reprieve. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday that the exempted electronics products would face new tariffs, along with semiconductors, within the next two months READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home New research highlights wealth divide between North and South Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football The US customs and border protection agency on Friday published a list of 20 product categories, including smartphones, laptops and semiconductor devices that would be exempted from the tariff. This meant that such products from China would be subject to a tariff of 20 per cent instead of 145 per cent. Last year, China supplied more than two thirds of the smartphones, laptops and PC monitors imported into the US and the exempted products account for almost 25 per cent of Chinese exports to the country. Beijing noted that this was the second change Trump had made to his tariff regime after he postponed \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on most countries last week. \u201cThis can be seen as a small step toward correcting its erroneous unilateral practice of \u2018reciprocal tariffs\u2019,\u201d China\u2019s commerce ministry said. Mr Trump blamed the media for giving a misleading impression of Friday\u2019s announcement, posting on his Truth Social website that nobody is getting off the hook of tariffs. \u201cWe are taking a look at semiconductors and the whole electronics supply chain in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like China.\u201d Applying a separate, national security tariff to Chinese electronics imports could still represent a reprieve for companies like Apple and Dell if it is set at 25 per cent, as some speculation in Washington suggests. Mr Trump and Mr Lutnick made clear that such products were moving into a separate tariff \u201cbucket\u201d so they would not face the 125 per cent \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d imposed on other Chinese imports, although they would still be subject to a separate, 20 per cent import levy Mr Trump imposed on China earlier this year. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping started a three-country tour of south-east Asia on Monday with a two-day state visit to Vietnam before he moves on to Malaysia and Cambodia. Writing in Vietnam\u2019s Nhan Dan newspaper on Monday, he called for closer co-operation between China and Vietnam on industry and supply chains and in strengthening the multilateral trading system. \u201cThere are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation.

Yes, please! Photo: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac The Vision Pro 2 might pack more upgrades than previously rumored. Instead of a minor spec bump, Apple could make the headset lighter and cheaper. This would address two of the biggest complaints with Apple\u2019s first mixed-reality headset. Vision Pro 2 could pack bigger upgrades than anticipated Despite packing impressive cutting-edge hardware and innovative capabilities, the Vision Pro failed to click with consumers. This is not surprising since the first iteration of the headset seemed to target developers more. Its steep $3,500 price tag, bulky design and limited use cases did not help either. While the Vision Pro did not sell in huge numbers, rumors suggest Apple could refresh the headset later this year. It would seemingly be a minor update, replacing the M1 chip with a faster M5 SoC. However, a new report claims Apple may be planning bigger changes now. Following recent changes to Siri\u2019s leadership team , Apple no longer has a Vision Products Group. Instead, Mike Rockwell \u2014 now also leading the Siri team \u2014 looks after the Vision Pro\u2019s software engineering. Paul Meade and others look after the hardware aspects of the headset, reporting directly to John Ternus. These changes bring the Vision Pro\u2019s development in line with other Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad. The new leadership wants to make bigger changes to the Vision Pro 2 headset than initially planned. In this weekly Power On newsletter , Bloomberg \u2018s Mark Gurman reveals, \u201cthe new plan is to release a model that makes the headset both lighter and cheaper.\u201d However, it\u2019s unclear how the company will achieve this. A lower price could force Apple to use cheaper components on the Vision Pro 2, negatively affecting the overall experience. Tim Cook wants to beat Meta to smart glasses Tim Cook ultimately envisions Apple creating true augmented reality glasses, like the ones Tony Stark wore in some Marvel films.

It\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint,\u201d reveals one of Gurman\u2019s sources. But with true AR glasses still years away, only time will tell if Apple can beat Meta to the finish line. On its part, Meta could launch futuristic smart glasses with a display and hand gestures later this year.

Historically, they have indeed been precious metals. However, they are not the only ones. There are elemental metals that are rarer and more expensive than gold. They have important industrial uses\u2026.and in some cases, they are much more expensive. Learn more about platinum, palladium, and rhodium, the other precious metals, on this episode of Everything Everywhere Daily. I\u2019ve previously done episodes on both gold and silver. Most of you are familiar with gold and silver, and there is a good chance many of you own at least a little in the form of jewelry, coins, or silverware. Silver and gold are two of the seven metals that were known in the ancient world, the others being iron, lead, copper, tin, and mercury. Gold and silver were *the* precious metals for thousands of years. However, starting in the 18th century, scientists began discovering a whole host of new elements, including new metals. In this episode, I\u2019m going to focus on three metals: platinum, palladium, and rhodium. There are other metals which some might consider precious, including rhenium, osmium, and iridium. However, by the end of this episode, you\u2019ll see why I\u2019ve decided to focus on these three elements. I\u2019m guessing that most of you have heard of platinum, some of you have heard of palladium, and most of you probably don\u2019t have a clue what rhodium is. All three of these metals are in the platinum group of elements on the periodic table, along with ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. Before I get into what they have in common and their primary use, I\u2019d like to go through the history of each metal. The first known use of platinum predates European awareness by centuries. Indigenous peoples in pre-Columbian South America, particularly in what is now Colombia and Ecuador, worked with platinum-like alloys as early as 600 BC. Archaeologists have uncovered jewelry and artifacts composed of a naturally occurring mixture of platinum, gold, and other platinum group metals. However, due to platinum\u2019s high melting point and chemical inertness, these ancient artisans did not isolate it but instead used native metal alloys found in alluvial river deposits. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the 16th century, they encountered these mysterious white metals in the rivers of New Granada, or modern-day Colombia. The Spanish called the metal platina , meaning \u201clittle silver,\u201d viewing it as an impurity mixed with gold. They considered it a nuisance and even discarded it. Some records suggest they tried to artificially transmute platinum into gold, unaware of its distinct properties. Platina is the root of the word platinum. Despite this early encounter, platinum remained unappreciated and misunderstood in Europe for nearly two centuries. Platinum entered the scientific consciousness in the 18th century. Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish naval officer and scientist, is often credited with introducing platinum to Europe. In 1735, during a scientific expedition to South America, he observed the metal and brought samples back to Spain. His report, published in 1748, drew the attention of chemists and mineralogists across Europe. In the mid-18th century, William Brownrigg and Charles Wood conducted early studies of platinum in England. They noted its high melting point and resistance to corrosion, key traits that hinted at its future usefulness. In France, chemist Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Chabaneau made significant progress in refining platinum by the 1780s. He was among the first to succeed in producing malleable platinum by painstakingly removing impurities such as iron, gold, and other platinum group metals, allowing it to be shaped and used for practical purposes. In 1803, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston discovered a more efficient method for purifying platinum using aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride. Platinum, along with the other metals in the platinum group, as well as gold, are often called noble metals because they are very resistant to corrosion. Despite its scarcity, platinum gained traction in coinage and jewelry in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Russia, under the reign of Tsar Nicholas I, platinum rubles were minted between 1828 and 1845. These were the first major coins made from platinum, using Russian reserves from the Ural Mountains, where platinum had been discovered in the early 1800s. In the decorative arts, platinum\u2019s bright luster and resistance to tarnish made it a favorite among jewelers, especially in the Edwardian and Art Deco periods. Its strength allows for intricate designs that securely hold gemstones, which makes it highly desirable in high-end jewelry. Platinum is slightly more common in the Earth\u2019s crust than gold, having an abundance of 5 parts per billion. It has the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is silver, dense, malleable, and non-corrosive. As of the recording of this episode, platinum had a spot price of $948.00 USD per ounce, although it has reached as high as $1300 per ounce. Palladium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston the guy who is credited with the discovery of the purification of Platinum. Wollaston was working on refining platinum ore from South America using aqua regia to dissolve the platinum and then chemically separating other elements from the solution. While experimenting, Wollaston identified a new metal with distinct properties. To confirm its novelty and avoid public skepticism, he first anonymously offered samples for sale in a London mineral shop under the name \u201cpalladium,\u201d after the recently discovered asteroid Pallas, which itself had been named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athena. Only later did Wollaston reveal himself as the discoverer. Although initially met with some controversy and disbelief, because the scientific community was suspicious of anonymous claims, the uniqueness of palladium was eventually confirmed. Over time, it was accepted as a new element and added to the growing catalog of metallic elements essential to chemistry and metallurgy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, palladium was occasionally used in jewelry, often alloyed with gold to create \u201cwhite gold.\u201d Its brightness and tarnish resistance made it a preferred material for fine settings and wedding bands. It was used in coinage as well, primarily in commemorative or bullion coins issued by countries like Russia, Canada, and Sierra Leone. Palladium is more plentiful than platinum at 15 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust. It has the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46. Its properties are very similar to those of platinum. As of the recording of this episode, palladium had a spot price of $903 per ounce, with a peak over $3200 per ounce. Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, the year after he discovered Palladium. He discovered it by analyzing the same samples of platinum ore, imported from South America, using the same techniques he used to discover palladium. After removing platinum and palladium from the solution, Wollaston noticed a rose-colored compound remaining in the residue. Through further analysis, he isolated a new, previously unknown element. He named it rhodium, derived from the Greek word rhodon , meaning \u201crose,\u201d in reference to the pinkish color of its chloride salt, rhodium chloride. Rhodium\u2019s chemical symbol is Rh, and its atomic number is 45. It is extremely rare, estimated at about 0.7 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust, rarer than gold or platinum. Rhodium is one of the most reflective metals known, making it ideal for mirrors and coatings. Like the other platinum group metals, it is corrosion-resistant, resisting attacks from most acids and atmospheric elements. It is also not rose colored as it is named, in its base metal form. Rhodium is not mined directly. It is obtained almost exclusively as a byproduct of platinum and nickel mining, which limits its supply. As of the recording of this episode, rhodium has a spot price of $5,250 per ounce, making it one of the most expensive elements regularly used in industry. It has reached prices as high as $27,000 an ounce. All three of these metals have similar properties: they are rare, silvery, and non-corrosive. However, they also share another attribute: they all have catalytic properties. They can accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed. In particular, all three of these rare and expensive metals are used in catalytic converters in automobiles. Catalytic converters are pollution control devices installed in vehicle exhaust systems that transform harmful emissions into less dangerous substances. These devices represent one of the most significant advances in automotive environmental technology since the 1970s. At its core, a catalytic converter functions through chemical reactions that occur when exhaust gases pass through its structure. These reactions don\u2019t happen spontaneously at exhaust temperatures, which is why catalysts are necessary\u2014they enable these chemical transformations without being consumed. The primary reactions occurring within a catalytic converter include oxidation reactions, which add oxygen to molecules like carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and reduction reactions, which remove oxygen from nitrogen oxide compounds. Through oxidation, carbon monoxide becomes carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Through reduction, nitrogen oxides break down into separate nitrogen and oxygen molecules. A catalytic converter\u2019s structure consists of several carefully engineered layers. At the center is the substrate or core, typically made from ceramic material formed into a honeycomb pattern. This design creates thousands of tiny channels through which exhaust gases flow. The honeycomb structure maximizes surface area within a compact space. When all the microscopic pores are considered, a modern catalytic converter can contain a surface area equivalent to several football fields. Some high-performance vehicles use metallic substrates instead, which offer better durability under extreme temperature conditions. The washcoat, a layer approximately 20-150 micrometers thick and composed primarily of aluminum oxide, covers this substrate. This washcoat serves multiple purposes: It increases the surface area even further, provides a suitable surface for catalyst adhesion, and can include additional components that enhance catalytic activity. The rough, porous nature of the washcoat creates an environment where gas molecules and catalytic sites can interact effectively. The actual catalyst materials are embedded within this washcoat. Platinum is an excellent oxidation catalyst, facilitating the conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into less harmful substances. Palladium performs similar functions to platinum and has become increasingly important as platinum prices have fluctuated. Rhodium specializes in the reduction side, helping to break down nitrogen oxides. These precious metals are used in extremely small quantities\u2014typically just a few grams per converter\u2014but their effect is profound. Temperature plays a crucial role in catalytic converter operation. These devices require heat to function properly, generally becoming effective above approximately 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). When a car is just being started, before the converter reaches this temperature, emissions are significantly higher. This has led to various strategies in modern vehicles, including positioning converters closer to the engine, using electric heating elements, or incorporating specialized materials that become active at lower temperatures. Not surprisingly, catalytic converter theft has become a significant and growing problem worldwide due to the high value of the precious metals they contain. These metals can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars per ounce on the black market, making catalytic converters attractive targets for thieves. The devices are relatively easy to remove from vehicles\u2019 undercarriages, often within minutes using basic tools. They also lack traceability, allowing stolen units to be quickly sold to unscrupulous scrap dealers. Hybrid vehicles, trucks, and SUVs are particularly vulnerable because they either contain higher quantities of these metals and/or have elevated frames that make access to the catalytic converters easier. It is possible to buy platinum and palladium bullion and jewelry. Platinum is more common as a metal for these purposes, but both can be found. Rhodium, because of its scarcity and price, is much harder to find, but it is possible if, for whatever reason, you wanted to own some. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium are all rare, expensive, shiny precious metals. However, that isn\u2019t why they are important. It is their unique chemical properties that make the elements in such demand, as they are largely responsible for the reduction in harmful emissions from automobiles.

The company has also provided an estimated selling price for the seven-seat body-on-frame SUV, stating it is expected to go for below RM350k. Previewed at the Kuala Lumpur International Mobility Show (KLIMS) last December, the Tank 500 \u2013 which measures in at 5,070 mm long, 1,934 mm wide and 1,905 mm tall \u2013 will arrive here in its parallel hybrid (non-plug-in) form , similar to how it is offered in Thailand . In this particular configuration, the SUV\u2019s powertrain consists of a 244 PS/380 Nm 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a 106 PS/268 Nm electric motor. Paired with a nine-speed hydraulic automatic transmission (HAT), the system delivers a combined 346 PS and 648 Nm of torque.

There\u2019s also a Body Transparent System, which uses cameras to superimpose the road image under and in front of the vehicle for improved visibility when traversing challenging terrain. As for equipment levels, we can expect to see a similar list to that found on the Thai model, which is available in two variant forms. In that market, standard kit includes automatic LED headlamps, LED daytime running lights, LED fog lamps, LED tail lights, power retractable side steps and 20-inch alloy wheels. You\u2019ll also find a 12.3-inch digital instrument display and 14.6-inch infotainment touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support, paddle shifters, a 12-speaker Infinity sound system, triple-zone climate control, Nappa leather upholstery, powered front seats with both massage and ventilation functions, second-row sunshades as well as third-row powered backrests.

U.S. President Donald Trump warned Sunday that no country would be \"getting off the hook\" on tariffs , as his administration suggested exemptions seen as favoring China would be short-lived. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a fast-moving, high-stakes game of brinkmanship since Trump launched a global tariff assault that particularly targeted Chinese imports. Tit-for-tat exchanges have seen U.S. levies imposed on China rise to 145 percent, and Beijing setting a retaliatory 125 percent band on U.S. imports. The U.S. side had appeared to dial down the pressure slightly on Friday, listing tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products for which China is a major source. Trump and some of his top aides said Sunday that the exemptions had been misconstrued and would only be temporary as his team pursued fresh tariffs against many items on the list. \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\" he posted on his Truth Social platform. Earlier, Beijing's Commerce Ministry had said Friday's move only \"represents a small step\" and insisted that the Trump administration should \"completely cancel\" the whole tariff strategy. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Monday \u2014 as he kicked off a tour of Southeast Asia with a visit to manufacturing powerhouse Vietnam \u2014 that protectionism \"will lead nowhere\". Writing in an article published in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi urged the two countries to \"resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.\" He also reiterated Beijing's line that a \"trade war and tariff war will produce no winner.\" Asian stock markets rose Monday after Trump's announcement of the tariff exemptions. Short-lived relief? Washington's new exemptions will benefit U.S. tech companies such as Nvidia and Dell as well as Apple, which makes iPhones and other premium products in China. The relief could, however, be short-lived with some of the exempted consumer electronics targeted for upcoming sector-specific tariffs on goods deemed key to U.S. national defense networks. On Air Force One Sunday, Trump said tariffs on the semiconductors \u2014 which powers any major technology from e-vehicles and iPhones to missile systems \u2014 \"will be in place in the not distant future.\" \"Like we did with steel, like we did with automobiles, like we did with aluminum... we'll be doing that with semiconductors, with chips and numerous other things,\" he said. \"We want to make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country,\" Trump reiterated, adding that he would do the same with \"drugs and pharmaceuticals.\" The U.S. president said he would announce tariffs rates for semiconductors \"over the next week,\" while his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said they would likely be in place \"in a month or two.\" The U.S. president sent financial markets into a tailspin earlier this month by announcing sweeping import taxes on dozens of trade partners, only to abruptly announce a 90-day pause for most of them. China was excluded from the reprieve. The White House says Trump remains optimistic about securing a deal with China, although administration officials have made it clear they expect Beijing to reach out first. Trump's trade representative Jamieson Greer told CBS \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"we don't have any plans\" for talks between the U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart Xi. China looks elsewhere China has sought to present itself as a stable alternative to an erratic Washington, courting countries spooked by the global economic storm. Xi warned that protectionism \"leads nowhere\" and that a trade war would have \"no winners\", state media said, as he arrived in Vietnam. Besides Vietnam, Xi will also visit Malaysia and Cambodia, seeking to tighten regional trade ties and with plans to meet his three Southeast Asian counterparts. The fallout from Trump's tariffs \u2014 and subsequent whiplash policy reversals \u2014 has sent particular shockwaves through the U.S. economy, with investors dumping government bonds, the dollar tumbling and consumer confidence plunging. Adding to the pressure on Trump, Wall Street billionaires \u2014 including a number of his own supporters \u2014 have openly criticized the tariff strategy as damaging and counterproductive. The White House insists the aggressive policy is bearing fruit, saying dozens of countries have already opened trade negotiations to secure a deal before the 90-day pause ends. \"We're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries,\" Greer told CBS.

This update has improved performance for many users, making sure smoother operation across a range of Apple products. However, it has not been without its challenges. Persistent bugs in the Podcasts and Voice Memos apps have left some users frustrated, particularly those who rely on these tools for daily tasks. These glitches, while not universal, have disrupted the seamless experience Apple users have come to expect. The video below from Brandon Butch gives us a look at iOS 18.4 and also the Apple News this week. Watch this video on YouTube . Apple has already begun work on iOS 18.4.1, which is expected to focus on bug fixes and security enhancements. This incremental update aims to address the lingering issues, reinforcing Apple\u2019s commitment to maintaining a high standard of reliability. Meanwhile, the iOS 18.5 beta introduces subtle design changes, such as updates to the Apple Care and Warranty section. While these tweaks improve usability, the absence of the highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features has left some users disappointed. Many had hoped for more significant advancements, raising questions about when these features will finally be introduced. iOS 19: A Glimpse Into the Future Looking ahead, iOS 19 is generating considerable excitement among Apple enthusiasts. Rumors suggest that Apple is planning a major overhaul of Siri , focusing on enhanced personalization capabilities. This update could enable Siri to deliver more tailored responses, adapting to individual user preferences and integrating seamlessly with advanced tools like photo editing features. Such improvements would mark a significant step forward in making Siri a more intuitive and versatile assistant. In addition to functional upgrades, iOS 19 is rumored to adopt a VisionOS-inspired design , featuring rounded icons and a more immersive interface. These aesthetic changes are expected to align with Apple\u2019s evolving design philosophy, creating a more cohesive and visually appealing user experience. If these updates come to fruition, iOS 19 could set a new benchmark for software design and functionality across Apple\u2019s ecosystem. With a potential release in the fall, anticipation is building for what could be one of Apple\u2019s most fantastic updates in recent years. WhatsApp and ChatGPT: Enhancing Everyday Tools Beyond iOS updates, popular apps like WhatsApp and ChatGPT are introducing significant improvements for Apple users. WhatsApp has rolled out several new features designed to enhance communication and productivity, including: Group chat online indicators for better visibility of active participants Enhanced video call functionality, improving the quality and reliability of virtual interactions Document scanning capabilities, streamlining the process of digitizing important files These updates make WhatsApp an even more versatile tool for both personal and professional use. Meanwhile, ChatGPT has expanded its memory capabilities , allowing it to reference past conversations for a more personalized experience. This development aligns with the growing demand for AI-powered tools that adapt to individual preferences. By integrating artificial intelligence more deeply into daily workflows, ChatGPT is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for users seeking efficiency and customization in their digital interactions. Apple Product Leaks and Ecosystem Evolution Speculation about upcoming Apple products continues to generate excitement. Reports suggest that production for the Vision Pro 2 is already underway, hinting at an earlier-than-expected launch. This next-generation device is expected to build on the innovations of its predecessor, further advancing Apple\u2019s ambitions in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Meanwhile, leaks about the iPhone 17 Pro have sparked discussions about potential design changes. While rumors of a two-tone back design have been debunked, reports indicate a larger camera bump, possibly to accommodate improved imaging technology. These developments suggest that Apple is prioritizing advancements in photography and videography, areas where it has consistently led the industry. In addition, WatchOS may soon adopt a VisionOS-inspired aesthetic , signaling Apple\u2019s broader push to unify its ecosystem. This design shift reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to creating a seamless user experience across devices, particularly as it explores new possibilities in AR and VR integration. Supply Chain Shifts and Tariff Impacts Apple is making significant changes to its supply chain, shifting a portion of its production to India . This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing while mitigating the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. By diversifying its manufacturing base, Apple aims to enhance the resilience of its supply chain and navigate geopolitical challenges more effectively. While some analysts have speculated that this shift could lead to price increases for Apple products, substantial hikes are unlikely in the short term. Apple\u2019s focus remains on maintaining competitive pricing while making sure the quality and availability of its products. This strategic relocation underscores the company\u2019s commitment to adapting to global economic conditions while safeguarding its market position. Other Noteworthy Developments Apple continues to expand its ecosystem with new tools and features designed to enhance user experiences. The recently released Apple Immersive Video Utility app allows users to manage Vision Pro media more effectively, catering to the growing demand for AR and VR content. This tool reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to supporting its innovative hardware with robust software solutions. On the social media front, Instagram is testing a feature that requires secret codes to access certain Reels, adding an element of exclusivity to content sharing. This experimental feature could reshape how users engage with content on the platform, emphasizing privacy and selectivity. In the realm of home automation, Apple\u2019s Smart Home Hub has been delayed until 2026 due to engineering challenges related to Siri. This delay underscores the complexities of integrating advanced AI into smart home systems, highlighting the technical hurdles that must be overcome to deliver a seamless and reliable user experience. Despite these challenges, Apple remains committed to advancing its smart home initiatives, making sure that its ecosystem continues to evolve in line with user needs.

Seriens producenter Megan Ganz, David Hornsby och Rob McElhenney s\u00e4ger i ett uttalande om att Mythic Quest nu l\u00e4ggs ner: \"Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close. We\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\" Det uppdaterade finalavsnittet av Mythic Quest kommer att sl\u00e4ppas p\u00e5 Apple TV+ n\u00e5gon g\u00e5ng senare den h\u00e4r veckan. variety.com Film & TV , Apple TV+ , mythic quest , hejd\u00e5 , komedi Mythic Quest The head of a successful video game design company and his troubled staff struggle to keep their hit game 'Mythic Quest' on top.

Jag hatar innerligt uttryck som Teslad\u00f6dare. Men det h\u00e4r kan vara en. Eller den f\u00f6rsta av m\u00e5nga. Och det \u00e4r bra f\u00f6r alla. Tesla, och i Sverige framf\u00f6rallt Model Y, har under m\u00e5nga \u00e5r varit det slutgiltiga svaret p\u00e5 vilken elbil man ska k\u00f6pa om man bara vill ha en bil som kryssar i s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga rutor som det bara g\u00e5r. Som kanske inte \u00e4r b\u00e4st p\u00e5 allt men som \u00e4r bra p\u00e5 det mesta. TL;DR Zeekr levererar en riktigt trevlig suv som sl\u00e5r det mesta p\u00e5 fingrarna, inklusive Tesla. Man levererar mer och b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 (n\u00e4stan) allt till en riktigt bra prislapp. Det \u00f6ppna m\u00e5l som Tesla har haft under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r \u00e4r nu officiellt st\u00e4ngt. F\u00f6r konkurrenterna har under alla \u00e5r kunnat vara bra p\u00e5 n\u00e5got, men inte p\u00e5 allt. D\u00e4r har Tesla varit b\u00e4st. Bra laddning (och framf\u00f6rallt n\u00e4tverk), gott om utrymmet, bra teknik \u00f6verlag, bra teknik i bilen, bra r\u00e4ckvidd och s\u00e5 vidare. Sen har Model Y varit en otroligt tr\u00e5kig bil att k\u00f6ra, men det har f\u00e5tt st\u00e5 undan n\u00e4r allt annat varit s\u00e5 bra. Tesla har ocks\u00e5 varit bra p\u00e5 att leverera detta till en, i elbilsv\u00e4rlden, vettig prislapp. Anonym rumpa utan loggor Men nu \u00e4r det slut p\u00e5 Teslas dominans. Kineserna, och i viss m\u00e5n europ\u00e9erna, har kommit i kapp, och nu \u00e4ven f\u00f6rbi. Den f\u00f6rsta bilen som visar detta p\u00e5 riktigt h\u00e4r i Sverige \u00e4r Zeekr 7X. Zeekr 7X \u00e4r suv-versionen av en modell som heter Zeekr 007 som aldrig kom hit men som finns i Kina. Eller det verkar som att kombiversionen faktiskt kommer hit, d\u00e5 under namnet Zeekr 7 GT. 35.4\u00b0 0 Jobbar du hemifr\u00e5n?

I serien f\u00e5r vi f\u00f6lja n\u00e5gra av de sista \u00f6verlevande m\u00e4nniskorna efter en zombieapokalyps med ett s\u00e4rskilt fokus p\u00e5 Joel (Pedro Pascal) och Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Den nya s\u00e4songen utspelar sig fem \u00e5r efter seriens f\u00f6rsta s\u00e4song. Joel och den 19-\u00e5riga Ellie h\u00e4nger fortfarande ihop, men relationen \u00e4r anstr\u00e4ngd efter att Joel tidigare f\u00f6rt Ellie bakom ljuset. I den nya s\u00e4songen introduceras \u00e4ven karakt\u00e4ren Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), som har en del otalt med Joel att g\u00f6ra upp, n\u00e5got som b\u00e4ddar f\u00f6r nya konflikter. Max b\u00f6rjade visa det f\u00f6rsta avsnittet i s\u00e4song tv\u00e5 av The Last of Us idag. S\u00e4songen best\u00e5r av sju avsnitt, och det sista avsnittet i s\u00e4songen kommer att visas den 26 maj. 42.4\u00b0 0 Klassisk Alfa Romeo Giulia med 670 h\u00e4star Henry k\u00f6r restomodden fr\u00e5n Totem Om man vill ha en bil med klassiskt Alfa Romeo-utseende kan man h\u00f6ra av sig till Totem Automobili som bygger GT Super. Det \u00e4r en restomoddad Giulia d\u00e4r i princip bara formerna finns kvar, allt annat \u00e4r uppdaterat och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrat. En sak kvarst\u00e5r dock - k\u00f6rgl\u00e4djen. Nu har Henry Catchpole f\u00e5tt k\u00f6ra besten och han diggar den stenh\u00e5rt. 38.8\u00b0 0 Fourier sl\u00e4pper open source-roboten N1 Bygg ihop din egen humanoida robot Fourier, en av Kinas ledande robottillverkare, har visat upp en humanoid open source-robot som man kallar f\u00f6r N1. Tanken bakom N1 \u00e4r bland annat att den ska locka fler utvecklare till robotbranschen. Fourier N1 \u00e4r 130 centimeter l\u00e5ng och v\u00e4ger 38 kg. Den kan r\u00f6ra sig fram\u00e5t i en hastighet p\u00e5 3,5 meter i sekunden, n\u00e5got som motsvarar cirka 12,5 km/h. Batteriet ska r\u00e4cka f\u00f6r drift i cirka tv\u00e5 timmar. Hela robotens design \u00e4r \u00f6ppen att ta del av och f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra under open source-licens. Det inneb\u00e4r att det kommer att bli m\u00f6jligt att ladda hem designen av roboten, vilka komponenter och material som anv\u00e4nts f\u00f6r att bygga den samt mjukvaran som driver roboten. I videoklippet nedan kan ni kolla in lite av vad Fourier N1 klarar av i sin grunddesign. 38.8\u00b0 0 Toshiba har gjort en b\u00e4rbar skivspelare Ta med dig dina LP-skivor med Aurex AX-RP10 Toshiba ger sig in i segmentet d\u00e4r vi hittar bland annat Audio-Technicas Sound Burger med nya Aurex AX-RP10, som \u00e4r en ny portabel skivspelare designad f\u00f6r vinylentusiaster som vill g\u00f6ra sina analoga musiksamlingar mer b\u00e4rbara. Aurex \u00e4r tillr\u00e4ckligt kompakt f\u00f6r att b\u00e4ras i en medf\u00f6ljande axelremsv\u00e4ska och klarar av att spela fullstora 12-tumsskivor. Den laddas med USB-C och har ett inbyggt batteri med upp till 10 timmars speltid. AX-RP10 spelar skivor i b\u00e5de 33 1/3 och 45 varv per minut, anv\u00e4nder MM-pickuper och \u00e4r remdriven. Den saknar inbyggda h\u00f6gtalare men erbjuder b\u00e5de en 3,5 mm ljudutg\u00e5ng f\u00f6r anslutning av h\u00f6rlurar eller en extern ljudanl\u00e4ggning, samt Bluetooth f\u00f6r tr\u00e5dl\u00f6s koppling till h\u00f6rlurar och h\u00f6gtalare. Vad priset kommer att hamna p\u00e5 vet vi inte \u00e4nnu, men skivspelaren f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas b\u00f6rja levereras n\u00e5gon g\u00e5ng nu under april. 37.5\u00b0 0 Polestar verkar dra ner i Kina Avbryter samarbete med Meizu Polestar m\u00e5 vara en produkt sprungen ur Volvo, men mycket fokus har legat p\u00e5 Kina f\u00f6r varum\u00e4rket. Man har i princip all tillverkning d\u00e4r, f\u00f6rutom Polestar 3 som ocks\u00e5 ska tillverkas i USA. Man har \u00e4ven teknikcenter i Nanjing. Men det g\u00e5r s\u00e5d\u00e4r med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljningen, man s\u00e5lde bara drygt 3000 bilar i Kina under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Totalt s\u00e5lde man 44.850 bilar. Det ska dock s\u00e4gas att Polestar 4, som nog fr\u00e4mst \u00e4r den modell som kan fungera i Kina, kom f\u00f6rst i slutet av \u00e5ret. Nu verkar man dra ner p\u00e5 fokuset p\u00e5 landet. Om man vill k\u00f6pa en Polestar s\u00e5 finns det fortfarande 36 st\u00e4llen att bes\u00f6ka enligt hemsidan, men i appen ska det bara finnas tio platser att provk\u00f6ra. Tio st\u00e4llen \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt lite \u00e4ven i Sverige. Man har \u00e4ven avslutat samarbetet med Meizu som man har haft ett tag. Det resulterade bland annat i en mobiltelefon, men Meizu har \u00e4ven hj\u00e4lpt till med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljning och kundservice. Om man drar ner p\u00e5 riktigt eller om man t\u00e4nker ta nya tag fram\u00f6ver \u00e4r oklart. 37.5\u00b0 0 Mercedes T-Klass och Citan s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt L\u00e4ggs ner V\u00e5ren 2022 lanserade Mercedes den nya modellen T-Klass som \u00e4r en liten minibuss. Det \u00e4r en slags m\u00e4nnisko-version av den befintliga modellen Citan som \u00e4r en klassisk hantverkarbil. Nu l\u00e4ggs b\u00e4gge modellerna ner f\u00f6r att de s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt. N\u00e4sta \u00e5r kommer tillverkningen att upph\u00f6ra och Mercedes kommer ist\u00e4llet att fokusera p\u00e5 st\u00f6rre modeller som \u00e4r mer l\u00f6nsamma. N\u00e5gra direkta ers\u00e4ttare \u00e4r i dagsl\u00e4get inte planerade. F\u00f6rra \u00e5ret s\u00e5ldes 23.351 exemplar av Citan och bara 5117 av T-Klass. 37.7\u00b0 0 Samsung presenterar nya strykt\u00e5liga enheter Galaxy XCover7 Pro har ett l\u00f6stagbart batteri Nu har Samsung presenterat tv\u00e5 nya strykt\u00e5liga enheter designade f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsanv\u00e4ndare och lite mer kr\u00e4vande arbetsmilj\u00f6er. Vi har den nya telefonen Galaxy XCover7 Pro tillsammans med surfplattan Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro. B\u00e5da modellerna erbjuder f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad h\u00e5llbarhet med IP68-klassning f\u00f6r vatten- och dammt\u00e5lighet samt MIL-STD-810H-certifiering mot st\u00f6tar, extrema temperaturer och vibrationer. Prestandan har uppgraderats med Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 p\u00e5 b\u00e5da enheterna, 6 eller 8 GB RAM, 5G-st\u00f6d och Wi-Fi 6E. Ut\u00f6ver det f\u00e5r \u00e4ven b\u00e5da enheterna f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrade stereoh\u00f6gtalare med anti-feedback-teknik f\u00f6r tydligare kommunikation vid till exempel walkie-talkie-anv\u00e4ndning, Vision Booster f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre sk\u00e4rml\u00e4sbarhet utomhus, programmerbara knappar f\u00f6r snabb\u00e5tkomst till funktioner, st\u00f6d f\u00f6r Samsung DeX samt Galaxy AI-funktioner. Galaxy XCover7 Pro \u00e4r utrustad med ett batteri p\u00e5 4350 mAh som kan bytas ut enkelt av anv\u00e4ndaren. Surfplattan Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro har ett st\u00f6rre batteri p\u00e5 10.100 mAh med unik Dual Hot-Swap-funktionalitet som till\u00e5ter batteribyte under drift utan att st\u00e4nga av enheten, samt ett \"No Battery Mode\" f\u00f6r drift via fast str\u00f6mk\u00e4lla. Tab Active5 Pro har \u00e4ven st\u00f6d f\u00f6r S Pen och ett fram\u00e5triktat NFC-chip f\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndning som exempelvis mobil betalterminal. B\u00e5de Galaxy XCover7 Pro och Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro b\u00f6rjar s\u00e4ljas nu i april. 38.5\u00b0 0 Hitta hemligt rum i nya spelet Blue Prince I ett hus som konstant f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras Blue Prince \u00e4r ett nysl\u00e4ppt spel som har f\u00e5tt en hel del bra recensioner sedan det sl\u00e4pptes f\u00f6rra veckan. Spelet \u00e4r utvecklat av Dogubomb och utgivet av Raw Fury och \u00e4r ett slags pusselspel d\u00e4r uppgifterna som ska l\u00f6sas f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras p\u00e5 daglig basis. Raw Fury skriver om spelet: \"Welcome to Mt. Holly, where every dawn unveils a new mystery. Navigate through shifting corridors and ever-changing chambers in this genre-defying strategy puzzle adventure. But will your unpredictable path lead you to the rumored Room 46? Upon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets. But be careful how you draft, for each day the manor\u2019s floor plan resets and the rooms you saw today may not be the same rooms you see tomorrow.\" Blue Prince sl\u00e4pps till PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S och PC. Ni hittar en trailer f\u00f6r spelet nedan. 38.8\u00b0 0 Nytt v\u00e4rldsrekord f\u00f6r eldriven motorcykel Kom 31 mil p\u00e5 en laddning Visst, 31 mil l\u00e5ter ju inte s\u00e5 v\u00e4rst l\u00e5ngt, men det \u00e4r tydligen tillr\u00e4ckligt f\u00f6r att kunna s\u00e4tta nytt v\u00e4rldsrekord i r\u00e4ckvidd p\u00e5 en laddning f\u00f6r eldrivna motorcyklar. Detta \u00e4r precis vad tillverkaren Verge Motorcycles nyligen gjorde med modellen TS Pro. Hojen v\u00e4ger in p\u00e5 245 kilo och motorn som sitter i bakhjulet \u00e4r p\u00e5 140 h\u00e4star har hela 1000 newtonmeter i vrid.

Tanken bakom designen p\u00e5 sadeln \"VabsRider\" \u00e4r att den ska kunna r\u00f6ra sig i takt med att cyklisten trampar p\u00e5 pedalerna, n\u00e5got som f\u00f6retaget s\u00e4ger ska minska risken f\u00f6r sm\u00e4rtor. F\u00f6retaget skriver om den ergonomiska cykelsadeln: \"Butt-friendly bike seat moves with your legs. If you donx27t want a part of your body to get sore, then that part shouldnx27t be pushing against something that doesnx27t move along with it. Thatx27s the thinking behind the vabsRider bicycle saddle.\" Sadeln ska passa p\u00e5 de flesta cykelmodeller och kunna justeras individuellt med hj\u00e4lp av olika inst\u00e4llningar. Den \u00e4r t\u00e4nkt att finansieras via en crowdfundingkampanj som ska dra ig\u00e5ng den 1 maj.

Alla som sett serien Severance p\u00e5 Apple TV+ har nog \u00e5tminstone funderat p\u00e5 hur det hade varit att ha ett av tangentborden och arbetsstationerna fr\u00e5n serien. Snart beh\u00f6ver du inte undra l\u00e4nge. F\u00f6retaget Atomic Keyboard ska n\u00e4mligen sl\u00e4ppa MDR Dasher Keyboard, som \u00e4r ett nytt tangentbord som h\u00e4mtat stark inspiration fr\u00e5n serien. Designen \u00e4r en n\u00e4ra replika av de retro-terminaler som anv\u00e4nds p\u00e5 den fiktiva arbetsplatsen Lumon Industries, som i sin tur \u00e4r baserade p\u00e5 verklighetens Data General Dasher-terminaler fr\u00e5n 70- och 80-talet. Tangentbordet har en kompakt 70-procent-layout med 73 tangenter i bl\u00e5tt och vitt, ett chassi i aluminium samt en optisk styrkula placerad p\u00e5 h\u00f6ger sida. Den mest anm\u00e4rkningsv\u00e4rda designdetaljen \u00e4r dock att tangentbordet saknar Escape-, Control- och Option-tangenter, som en blinkning till seriens teman om inst\u00e4ngdhet och brist p\u00e5 kontroll. MDR Dasher riktar sig d\u00e4rf\u00f6r fr\u00e4mst till samlare och stora fans av serien. Det kostar 400 US-dollar och finns nu att f\u00f6rhandsboka i en begr\u00e4nsad upplaga. 39.1\u00b0 0 Han lurade folk att Tesla k\u00f6pt Max Lyckat aprilsk\u00e4mt F\u00f6r ett tag sedan var det 1 april och det lurades hej vilt till h\u00f6ger och v\u00e4nster.

Kronkursen fortsatte att st\u00e4rkas mot dollarn under dagen och i skrivande stund kostar en dollar 9,66 kronor. Det kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med att en dollar kostade 11,07 kronor vid \u00e5rsskiftet, n\u00e5got som inneb\u00e4r att kronkursen har \u00f6kat med \u00f6ver 14 procent j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med dollarn sedan dess. En euro kostar nu 10,98 kronor vilket kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med de 11,45 kronor euron kostade vid \u00e5rsskiftet, en \u00f6kning f\u00f6r kronan med lite \u00f6ver 4 procent. Anledningen till att kronan har st\u00e4rkts den senaste tiden verkar bero p\u00e5 att investerare anser att kronan \u00e4r en n\u00e5gorlunda trygg valuta, n\u00e5got som vanligtvis inte \u00e4r fallet. Robert Bergqvist, SEB:s seniorekonom, s\u00e4ger till TT: \u2013 Det \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt ovanligt det vi ser nu. N\u00e4r det \u00e4r st\u00f6kigt och oroliga tider brukar man ist\u00e4llet s\u00f6ka sig bort fr\u00e5n de mindre valutorna som till exempel den svenska kronan. \u2013 Men nu har det h\u00e4r m\u00f6nstret f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrats. Nu har det n\u00e4stan blivit tv\u00e4rtom. Det vill s\u00e4ga att dollarn har blivit en cyklisk valuta, som tappar n\u00e4r oron \u00f6kar. Medan kronan har blivit en s\u00e5 kallad defensiv valuta som m\u00e5nga s\u00f6ker till f\u00f6r trygghet. 61.0\u00b0 0 SVT tidigarel\u00e4gger Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen Drar ig\u00e5ng i natt SVT meddelade idag att man kommer att b\u00f6rja s\u00e4nda sin slow-tv-show Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen en vecka tidigare \u00e4n planerat. Anledningen till tidigarel\u00e4ggningen av programmet beror p\u00e5 att v\u00e4rmen gjort att \u00e4lgarna redan har b\u00f6rjat vandra, n\u00e5got som tvingat SVT att g\u00f6ra en \u00e4ndring i sitt s\u00e4ndningsprogram. Stefan Edlund, producent av Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen, s\u00e4ger: \u2013 Det \u00e4r full trafik av \u00e4lgar. De st\u00e5r och v\u00e4ntar p\u00e5 oss.

Den f\u00f6rsta varianten av Vision Pro, som lanserades i USA i februari f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret, kostar fortfarande fr\u00e5n 500 dollar och v\u00e4ger cirka 680 gram. Ut\u00f6ver den l\u00e4ttare och billigare modellen uppger Gurman att Apple \u00e4ven utvecklar en annan version av Vision Pro som ska kunna anslutas med kabel direkt till en Mac-dator. Syftet med detta \u00e4r att skapa en upplevelse med extremt l\u00e5g f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Med detta skulle man kunna f\u00f6rlita sig b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 kr\u00e4vande professionella applikationer genom att str\u00f6mma Mac-sk\u00e4rmen eller anv\u00e4nda headsetet f\u00f6r exempelvis kirurgisk bildvisning eller i flygsimulatorer. Det \u00e4r i nul\u00e4get oklart n\u00e4r Apple planerar att lansera n\u00e5gon av dessa nya headset-versioner.

Handlingen kretsar runt hur Godzilla vaknar upp och hotar att f\u00f6rst\u00f6ra v\u00e4rlden. Efter att Marvel-hj\u00e4ltarna inte lyckas besegra besten p\u00e5 egen hand tvingas de kalla in n\u00e5gra av jordens v\u00e4rsta superskurkar f\u00f6r att tillsammans f\u00f6rs\u00f6ka ge Godzilla en match. Bland superhj\u00e4ltarna som ska stoppa Godzilla finns bland andra The Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man och Avengers.

I Europa och Storbritannien h\u00f6js det rekommenderade priset p\u00e5 PS5 Digital Edition till 500 euro, fr\u00e5n 450 euro. Priset p\u00e5 standardversionen av PS5 med inbyggd skivl\u00e4sare f\u00f6rblir dock of\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat. \u00c4ven i Australien och Nya Zeeland h\u00f6js priserna p\u00e5 b\u00e5da PS5-modellerna, medan USA dock konstigt nog klarar sig utan n\u00e5gra pris\u00e4ndringar.

Totalt ska det handla om 250.000 ton utsl\u00e4ppsminskning som tillfaller Sverige fram till 2030, det motsvarar cirka 2 procent av utsl\u00e4ppen som uppstod fr\u00e5n bilk\u00f6rning i Sverige under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Det kommer att kosta 400 kronor per ton utsl\u00e4ppsminskning. Det \u00e4r betydligt billigare \u00e4n de cirka 700 kronor per ton utsl\u00e4ppsr\u00e4tter kostade i genomsnitt i EU:s utsl\u00e4ppshandel under 2024. Regeringen planerar att l\u00e4gga 1,5 miljarder kronor p\u00e5 klimat\u00e5tg\u00e4rder i andra l\u00e4nder fram till 2036. \u00c5tg\u00e4rderna har dock f\u00e5tt kritik d\u00e5 det anses sv\u00e5rt att ber\u00e4kna hur stora utsl\u00e4ppsminskningar klimatprojekt i fattiga l\u00e4nder faktiskt ger. 7.0\u00b0 0 Audio-Technica har ocks\u00e5 gjort en lysande skivspelare Finns i 1000 exemplar Audio-Technica h\u00e4rmar Brian Eno och sl\u00e4pper nu sin egen lysande skivspelare med namnet Hotaru (AT-FTT) under designveckan i Milano. Skivspelaren har en belyst skivtallrik i akryl vars belysning kan synkroniseras med musiken och lysa i 20 olika f\u00e4rger. Den har tre ljusl\u00e4gen: konstant f\u00e4rg, f\u00e4rg som \u00e4ndras i takt med musiken, eller en mjuk \u00f6verg\u00e5ng mellan f\u00e4rgerna. Namnet Hotaru betyder f\u00f6rresten eldfluga p\u00e5 japanska. F\u00f6r att minimera vibrationer sv\u00e4var akryltallriken magnetiskt ovanf\u00f6r basen, och driften sker via en rem som \u00e4r dold inuti aluminiumchassit. Endast 1000 exemplar av Hotaru kommer att tillverkas globalt, och priset \u00e4r satt till 9999 dollar. F\u00f6r att kunna k\u00f6pa ett exemplar m\u00e5ste intresserade f\u00f6rst registrera sitt intresse online via Audio-Technicas webbplats.

Det f\u00f6rutsp\u00e5r iallafall Bloombergs Mark Gurman. Han skriver att \u00e4ven om vi inte kommer att f\u00e5 riktiga macOS p\u00e5 iPad, s\u00e5 kommer f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna att vara tillr\u00e4ckligt stora f\u00f6r att tillfredsst\u00e4lla de anv\u00e4ndare som l\u00e4nge \u00f6nskat en mer Mac-liknande upplevelse p\u00e5 iPad. Enligt Gurman kommer uppdateringar i iPadOS 19 att fokusera p\u00e5 produktivitet, multitasking och f\u00f6nsterhantering, med m\u00e5let att f\u00e5 enheten att fungera mer som en Mac. Dessa st\u00f6rre, mer Mac-lika f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar v\u00e4ntas dock f\u00f6rst \"omkring ett \u00e5r\" efter lanseringen av M4 iPad Pro. Hur det hela kan komma att se ut f\u00e5r vi dock inte h\u00f6ra n\u00e5gra detaljer om, s\u00e5 vi f\u00e5r helt enkelt v\u00e4nta och se. 43.9\u00b0 0 Pet Power Leash \u00e4r ett smart koppel Har en automatisk n\u00f6dbroms F\u00f6retaget Hello.it har utvecklat ett hundkoppel som man f\u00f6rsett med lite funktioner som kanske kan vara intressanta f\u00f6r de som \u00e4r intresserade av b\u00e5de hundar och tech. Kopplet har bland annat en n\u00f6dbroms inbyggd som aktiveras om kopplet k\u00e4nner av att hunden f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker springa iv\u00e4g, n\u00e5got som kanske g\u00f6r att hunden inte kommer upp i de hastigheter som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att rycka kopplet ur hund\u00e4garens hand. Det finns \u00e4ven inbyggd belysning som g\u00e5r att justera i olika styrkor samt en timer som signalerar n\u00e4r hunden f\u00e5tt 30 minuters tr\u00e4ning. Kopplet laddar upp det inbyggda batteriet sj\u00e4lv genom den kinetiska energi som genereras n\u00e4r kopplet dras in och ut ur sitt fodral. Hello.it:s Pet Power Leash finansieras via crowdfunding p\u00e5 Kickstarter. Hoppar man p\u00e5 den kampanjen kostar kopplet cirka 615 kronor och leveranserna ska dra ig\u00e5ng i juni 2025. H\u00e4r nedanf\u00f6r hittas ett videoklipp d\u00e4r kopplets funktioner visas upp lite n\u00e4rmare. 28.3\u00b0 0 Klassisk brittisk brevl\u00e5da f\u00e5r plats f\u00f6r paket Vill vi ha det h\u00e4r i Sverige? Brevl\u00e5dor \u00e4r ju till f\u00f6r brev, men det skickas ju inte s\u00e5 mycket brev l\u00e4ngre. Paket d\u00e4remot, det skickar vi som aldrig f\u00f6rr. Brittiska Royal Mail har d\u00e4rf\u00f6r tagit fram en ny brev-och-paketl\u00e5da som har plats f\u00f6r b\u00e5da sorterna. Man har beh\u00e5llit den ikoniska designen men adderat en ny lucka under den klassiska f\u00f6r breven. I denna kan man stoppa in mindre paket. Men f\u00f6r att man ska f\u00e5 \u00f6ppna denna s\u00e5 m\u00e5ste man f\u00f6rst l\u00e4sa av paketets kod s\u00e5 att luckan sedan ska \u00f6ppnas. Detta f\u00f6r att folk inte ska anv\u00e4nda l\u00e5dan som soptunna. P\u00e5 l\u00e5dan finns en kamera som l\u00e4ser av paketets kod och tekniken i l\u00e5dan drivs av solceller. Man har placerat ut fem s\u00e5dana h\u00e4r l\u00e5dor i ett pilotprojekt f\u00f6r att se hur det g\u00e5r. Royal Mail har 115.000 brevl\u00e5dor utplacerade och 98 procent av adresserna i landet finns mindre \u00e4n 800 meter fr\u00e5n dessa l\u00e5dor. 48.8\u00b0 0 Kina pausar export av s\u00e4llsynta jordartsmetaller Efter att handelskriget med USA eskalerat Kina har stoppat exporten av sju sorters s\u00e4llsynta jordartsmetaller, n\u00e5got som tros ha att g\u00f6ra med det eskalerande handelskriget mellan USA och Kina. Kina producerar 90 procent av v\u00e4rldens s\u00e4llsynta jordartsmetaller, metaller som \u00e4r viktiga f\u00f6r komponenter inom bland annat fordons- halvledar- och f\u00f6rsvarsindustrin. F\u00f6r att exportera metallerna m\u00e5ste de kinesiska export\u00f6rerna nu ans\u00f6ka om en licens hos landets handelsdepartement. Enligt k\u00e4llor som nyhetsbyr\u00e5n Reuters varit i kontakt med kan det ta minst tv\u00e5 m\u00e5nader innan Kina till\u00e5ter export av metallerna igen, n\u00e5got som kan st\u00e4lla till det f\u00f6r f\u00f6retag runt om i v\u00e4rlden som \u00e4r beroende av metallerna f\u00f6r sin produktion. Enligt New York Times k\u00e4llor ska framtida kinesisk export av metallerna kunna stoppas permanent till vissa f\u00f6retag, bland annat underleverant\u00f6rer till den amerikanska milit\u00e4ren. 48.3\u00b0 0 McMurtry k\u00f6r sin bil upp-och-ner Genererar 2000 kilos marktryck - fr\u00e5n 0 km/h Vi har skrivit om McMurtrys supersnabba Sp\u00e9irling tidigare.

Bilen k\u00f6rs in i ett rotisserie, drar ig\u00e5ng fl\u00e4ktarna och h\u00e5ller sig kvar medan allt snurrar.

However, the chip sector faced headwinds due to national security concerns. This exemption raised hopes for improved trade relations, supported by better-than-expected loan data and anticipated policy support. AP China and Hong Kong stocks rebounded on Monday, fueled by gains in tech shares after the U.S. exempted smartphones and computers from tariffs. China and Hong Kong stocks rose on Monday as tech shares climbed after the White House exempted smartphones and computers from \"reciprocal\" U.S. tariffs, while the chip sector was weighed down by national security concerns . China's blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.5%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9% by the midday trading break, after losing 2.9% and 3.1% last week, respectively. Hong Kong benchmark's Hang Seng climbed 2.4% after an 8.5% loss last week. The Hang Seng Tech Index added 2.7%. Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China, while indicating these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed within a month. China's Apple suppliers jumped on the temporary relief. The CSI Electronics Index jumped 0.9% by midday. Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn Industrial Internet rallied 1.1%, and acoustic components manufacturer Goertek jumped 2.5%. Live Events Keeping a lid on gains, the CSI Semiconductor Index declined as much as 0.9% after Trump said that chips from China will face a national security probe over the next week. The news of the exemption \"fuels expectation of potential improvement in trade relations, and even the prospect of trade negotiations,\" said Li Shuding, an investor adviser of Galaxy Securities. He added that March loan data was better than expected, and \"we expect intensive roll-out of policies\" to support the economy. Before Monday's rebound, the CSI 300 Index and Hang Seng Index had lost 3.5% and 9.9%, respectively, since \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. Trump threatened to implement sweeping tariffs against trading partners with China being the major target, raising concerns about slowing global economic growth and disruptions to trade. Goldman Sachs has revised its 12-month targets for MSCI China and the CSI300 Index, lowering them to 75 and 4,300, respectively, down from previous estimates of 81 and 4,500, respectively. \" U.S.-China trade tensions have soared to unprecedented levels, prompting concerns about global recession, and decoupling risks between the two largest economies globally in other strategic cohorts, notably capital markets, technology, and geopolitics,\" China strategist Kinger Lau said in a note on Monday. Elsewhere, China's exports in March rose 12.4% from a year earlier, handily beating 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect.

Last week, it was learnt that the carmaker rolled out the Flyme Auto S version 1.1.4 firmware update for a host of fixes . According to a presentation slide that was photographed, the over-the-air updates are pushed to customer vehicles on a quarterly basis. Completed so far as of its April OTA update are charging start/stop button, optimised braking and the ability for owners to view the vehicle\u2019s location when it is asleep. The next update set for the second quarter of this year, to be rolled out approximately in July, will include wireless Apple CarPlay, switchable \u201cice-cream van\u201d sound , access to third-party apps, radio scanning fix, as well as other to-be-announced improvements. This will be followed by updates scheduled for Q3 2025, to be released approximately in October. These will include wired Apple CarPlay, a memory function for speed warning switching, and other improvements. Wrapping up the updates timeline in Q4 2025 in December will be wired and wireless Android Auto, along with other updates. Launched towards the end of last year, the Proton eMas 7 made its debut with two variants \u2013 Prime and Premium \u2013 each with a front-mounted electric motor producing 218 PS and 320 Nm. This propels Proton\u2019s first electric SUV from 0-100 km/h in 6.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 175 km/h. The Prime starts the range with a 49.52 kWh battery offering 345 km of range while the Premium brings a 60.022 kWh unit that is good for 410 km (both on the WLTP testing standard), and both are the Geely Aegis short-blade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. Charging the eMas 7 from 30 to 80% takes 20 minutes using DC fast charging at up to 100 kW with the Premium (80 kW for the Prime), while a full charge using an 11 kW AC wallbox takes 4.9 hours for the Prime and 6.1 hours for the Premium. The eMas 7 is also the first Proton to get a suite of driver assistance features, including Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities. Looking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro .

By Debby Wu, Josh Wingrove, and Shawn Donnan, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:03 IST Photo Credit: Apple Trump\u2019s tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks Highlights The exclusions were published late Friday US Customs and Border Protection published the exclusions The move is the first major softening of any kind in Trump\u2019s conflicts Advertisement President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, representing a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple and Nvidia even if it proves a temporary one. The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump's 125 percent China tariff and his baseline 10 percent global tariff on nearly all other countries. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren't made in the US. Apple Said to Have Airlifted 600 Tons of iPhones From India The pause will be welcome news to consumers, some of whom rushed to buy new iPhones and other devices amid fears that the tariffs would send prices soaring. It's also a big win for major technology companies that have presented massive US spending pledges for Trump in recent months. Trump's tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks and ignited a rapidly escalating trade war with China. The move is the first significant softening of any kind in Trump's conflict with China. It was backdated to April 5. The exemptions cover almost $390 billion (roughly Rs. 33,57,764 crore) in US imports based on official US 2024 trade statistics, including more than $101 billion (roughly Rs. 86,9,574 crore) from China, according to data compiled by Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the Rand China Research Center. Apple Exported $17 Billion in iPhones From India Last Year, Minister Says The biggest category related to China is smartphones. The US imported smartphones valued at more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 3,52,995 crore) from China in 2024, or about nine percent of total imports from China. Also covered are computers and similar devices, of which the US imported more than $36 billion (roughly Rs 3,09.947 crore) in 2024. Altogether the exemptions cover consumer electronics and semiconductors that accounted for about 22 percent of US imports from China in 2024, DiPippo said. \u201cThis is a large hole in the US tariff wall that will spare key firms like Apple and consumers of laptops and phones from sticker shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut many other consumer, intermediate, and capital goods from China still face prohibitively high US tariffs. This exemption only covers one segment of the US economy.\u201d Trump on Saturday declined to elaborate on the exemptions but hinted at further developments on Monday. \u201cI'll give you that answer on Monday. We'll be very specific on Monday,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cWe're taking in a lot of money; as a country we're taking in a lot of money.\u201d The White House also released a corresponding memo indicating that the exemptions also extend to changes in small-parcel shipping duties. Trump had moved to end the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, beginning with China, that generally means parcels worth $800 (roughly Rs. 68,880) or below don't face duties. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacturing critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cThat's why the president has secured trillions of dollars in US investments from the largest tech companies in the world.\u201d She said those companies are \u201chustling to onshore\u201d their manufacturing to the US. The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China. The products that won't be subject to Trump's new tariffs include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US, as well as other chipmakers. \u201cAll products that are properly classified in these listed provisions will be excluded from the reciprocal tariffs,\u201d the notice said. The move appeared to exclude the products from the 10 percent global baseline tariff on other countries, including Samsung Electronics' home of South Korea. The tariff reprieve does not extend to a separate Trump levy on China \u2014 a 20 percent duty applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl, including the shipment of precursor materials. Other previously existing levies, including those that predate Trump's current term, also appear unaffected. \u201cThe US tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House the reality of the situation was finally recognised in the Beltway,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Saturday. \u201cThere is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations.\u201d The original list of tariff exemptions included some semiconductor products \u2014 including central processing units known as CPUs. But those measures did not carve out tech products crucial to AI development including graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the servers that they power. Servers powered by AI chips from companies such as Nvidia and their critical components are primarily manufactured and assembled in Taiwan and Mexico. Friday's announcement would cover both Taiwanese and Mexican production, in a significant reprieve for companies seeking to build AI infrastructure in the US. Semiconductor Equipment Exemptions Also crucial are new exemptions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, made by companies such as ASML Holding NV in the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron Ltd. in Japan. Those tools are essential for building chip factories, and comprise the lion's share of the multibillion dollar price tag for such plants. Companies including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel Corp. are building new US facilities with support from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump's initial \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff announcement included exemptions for semiconductors and other sectors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn't yet done so but the latest exclusions are related to that exemption. The move excludes most of Apple's core products from the escalating tariffs on China, including iPhones, iPads and Apple watches. Apple shares have slid since Trump announced the tariffs. Discussions gained additional urgency in recent days after Trump increased the tariffs on China, putting companies like Apple in a more difficult position than competitors like Samsung, who are less reliant on China. Companies and tech industry lobbyists have also argued that reshoring the final assembly of smartphones and other products is impossible, one person familiar with the discussions said. But the move also is aimed at laying the groundwork for new targeted sectoral tariffs that are likely to hit the industry. The administration is expected to soon launch a new investigation into imports of semiconductors. That would eventually lead to the imposition of tariffs on chips within weeks or months. Those duties, like ones imposed recently on steel and aluminum, are likely to impose duties on products that include semiconductors as well as the chips themselves. Trump's sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25 percent, though it's not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be. It's also not clear how widely he would apply that tariff. Representatives from Nvidia and ASML declined to comment. Spokesmen for Tokyo Electron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The US International Trade Commission declined to comment on the exemptions, while the US Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce didn't respond to requests for comment. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Bureau Updated Apr 14, 2025, 10:59 AM IST iPhone maker Foxconn plans to expand in India, create jobs The Uttar Pradesh government is reportedly in talks with iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to set up a new facility in the Greater Noida region. According to sources, UP government officials and representatives of the Taiwanese company have already held two rounds of meetings at Delhi and Lucknow on the proposed project. The new facility is likely to centre around mobile phone manufacturing.

The facility is proposed to be set up on around 300-acres of land. It would be in addition to the 50-acre joint venture project that Foxconn has with HCL for an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility, sources said. Meanwhile, reports from earlier in the year had indicated that HCL-Foxconn joint venture, which is separate from this new plant, has begun talks with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as well as Taiwanese major CTCI for the semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) facility. The JV is also awaiting Cabinet approval. Foxconn is reportedly investing $37.2 million to hold a 40 per cent stake in the venture. The new facility is expected to create 40,000 jobs and will include residences for all workers inside the complex. Sources added that the UP government was interested in the project as the Noida-Greater Noida region already accounts for nearly 50 per cent of all mobile phone exports from the country. \u201cThere is no better place than UP to have a facility for Apple. Locating it in Noida will add to the ecosystem in the region,\u201d sources added. Foxconn started manufacturing iPhone 15 in its Tamil Nadu facility in Sriperumbudur in 2023. Apple ferried 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the US just after announcements of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The company lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at the Chennai airport from 30 hours to six hours.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email He highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers. When Donald Trump launched his tariff war with China, he expressed hopes for major companies like Apple to manufacture their products in the United States. However, industry experts and critics argued that large-scale manufacturing in America isn't practical due to various reasons. Amid this, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has resurfaced on social media, where he explains why Apple continues to manufacture its products in China. In the video, Mr Cook debunked the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour. Instead, he highlighted the importance of China's extensive supply chain, infrastructure, and skilled workforce in supporting Apple's manufacturing needs. Mr Cook said, \"There is confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago.\" He further highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers concentrated in one place. He emphasised that Apple's products require advanced tools and high precision, which China excels in due to its deep tooling expertise. \"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is. It is like the products we do require really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with materials that we do are state-of-the-art,\" he added.

Reacting to the video, one user wrote, \"True, it's about scale, speed, and precision. China has a massive pool of highly skilled tooling and manufacturing engineers. It's not just labor, it's a full ecosystem built over decades, with deep supply chains and rapid turnaround that's hard to replicate elsewhere.\" Another commented, \"Totally agree with Tim. Companies exploited China's cheap labour earlier, but it was China's rapid development of manufacturing tech that took it so ahead of the US and Germany's of the world.\" Notably, Apple relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted its focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base. India's growing electronics manufacturing ecosystem, coupled with government incentives and a large skilled workforce, makes it an attractive location for Apple to set up production facilities.

First, it has been reported that the Vision Pro 2 is on the way from the Cupertino-based tech giant, which is expected to address latency and compatibility issues. In addition, it is also being reported that a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro is currently in the works. Vision Pro 2 and More Are Coming Soon From Apple Analyst Mark Gurman ( via Bloomberg ) revealed Apple's plans for the future of the Vision Pro lineup. The tech company is said to be now all hands-on deck for its next developments. Two headsets are reportedly in the works that seek to address issues that the original Vision Pro has. First, there will reportedly be a Vision Pro 2 from the company, but it is not what people are expecting. Gurman said that Apple will not jump from the M2 to the M5 but will focus more on offering an ultra-low latency experience that plugs into the Mac in order to access more applications for the headset. On the other hand, there will also reportedly be a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro. Tim Cook Wants to Beat Meta in XR Tech Apart from that, Gurman also revealed that Apple wants to beat Meta at its game, with CEO Tim Cook's intending to develop a pair of AR glasses. This information was reportedly shared by an Apple engineer who claimed that Cook does not care about \"anything else\" other than to develop \"true\" AR glasses with cameras and microphones to gp up against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and Project Orion in the future. Apple's Vision Pro The Apple Vision Pro was the talk of the town when Apple first introduced it almost two years ago, centering on a wearable headset packed with significant features. When it was released, the Vision Pro went through the ups and downs as sales faltered after several months, but it still earned accolades along the way, including Popular Science's \" Innovation of the Year .\" Despite its poor performance later on, there is still more to be expected from Apple in their Vision Pro development, with two devices reported to reinforce the lineup . It was previously revealed by Cook that the original Vision Pro was meant for developers, and he defended the original pricing of the headset, saying it was made for those who can afford this early adoption of the device.

This exemption spares U.S. consumers from potential price increases on these widely used products, which are predominantly manufactured in countries like China and India. While this move provides temporary relief for Apple and its customers, it also raises critical questions about the long-term impact of trade policies on global manufacturing strategies and the broader technology sector. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details about the exemption. Watch this video on YouTube . How Tariff Exemptions Affect Apple and Consumers By excluding Apple products from higher tariffs, the U.S. government has effectively shielded consumers from substantial price hikes. Without this exemption, Apple would likely have passed the increased production costs onto buyers, making its devices significantly more expensive. For example, a high-end iPhone manufactured entirely in the U.S. could cost as much as $3,500, a price point that would render it unaffordable for many consumers. This exemption allows Apple to maintain its current pricing structure, making sure that its devices remain accessible to a broad audience. For consumers, this means continued access to Apple\u2019s products at familiar price points, preserving affordability in a market where rising costs are a constant concern. However, this relief is temporary, as future trade policy changes could still disrupt pricing and availability. Apple\u2019s Global Manufacturing Strategy Apple\u2019s reliance on global manufacturing hubs, particularly in China and India, is a cornerstone of its supply chain. These countries offer access to skilled labor, advanced manufacturing infrastructure, and lower production costs, allowing Apple to produce high-quality devices at competitive prices. While Apple has made investments in U.S.-based facilities, such as its Texas plant for server production and chip-related processes, the company has no immediate plans to shift large-scale iPhone production to the U.S. due to the prohibitive costs involved. This global manufacturing strategy highlights the complexities of balancing cost efficiency with geopolitical and economic pressures. The tariff exemption temporarily alleviates some of these pressures, but it does not resolve the underlying challenges of Apple\u2019s production model. As trade policies evolve, Apple will need to continuously adapt its strategy to maintain its competitive edge while addressing the demands of various stakeholders. Trade Policies and Their Influence on Pricing The tariff exemption underscores the intricate relationship between global trade policies and regional pricing strategies. While U.S. consumers benefit from stable iPhone prices, the situation in other regions remains less predictable. In some markets, Apple may absorb additional costs to maintain competitive pricing, while in others, it might adjust prices upward to offset potential losses caused by tariffs or other economic factors. This uncertainty extends beyond Apple. Competitors like Samsung and Google, which also rely on manufacturing in China, face similar challenges. If tariffs are imposed on their products, they may need to reevaluate their pricing strategies, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers worldwide. This dynamic creates a ripple effect across the consumer electronics market, influencing not only pricing but also innovation and product availability. Competitor Responses and Consumer Implications The tariff exemption for Apple products raises important questions about how competitors will respond. Companies like Samsung and Google, which directly compete with Apple in the smartphone and consumer electronics markets, may be forced to adjust their pricing models if tariffs increase their production costs. This could result in higher prices for a wide range of devices, from smartphones to laptops and wearables. For consumers, the affordability of future devices remains a pressing concern. Speculation about the pricing of upcoming iPhone models, such as the iPhone 17, continues to grow. Many wonder how long Apple can sustain its current pricing structure amid global economic pressures and evolving trade policies. The broader industry faces similar challenges as manufacturers grapple with balancing cost efficiency, competitive pricing, and consumer demand. The Bigger Picture The decision to exempt Apple products from higher tariffs highlights the interconnected nature of trade policies, global manufacturing, and the consumer electronics industry. While U.S. consumers currently benefit from stable prices on Apple devices, the long-term implications for the industry remain uncertain. Companies like Apple must navigate an increasingly complex landscape, balancing production costs, pricing strategies, and consumer affordability to maintain their market positions. As trade policies and economic conditions continue to evolve, the ripple effects will likely shape the future of technology pricing and accessibility worldwide. For now, the exemption provides short-term relief, but it also serves as a reminder of the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead for Apple, its competitors, and the global tech industry.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA Pat Leahy Mon Apr 14 2025 - 06:00 The first face-to-face meeting between the EU and the United States since the White House imposed tariffs on imports to the US will take place on Monday when EU trade commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d meets commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and US trade officials in Washington, DC. EU countries including Ireland will be watching anxiously for a sign that substantive negotiations with the US to avoid a damaging trade war can begin soon \u2013 but this weekend senior officials in Dublin and Brussels were hopeful, rather than confident of this. Dublin is especially concerned that pharmaceuticals \u2013 which comprise the great bulk of Irish exports to the US \u2013 should be part of the overall negotiations. The EU and Ireland expect that if pharma exports are part of the broader trade negotiations, they are unlikely to be hit with special tariffs, despite repeated threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on the sector soon.

But Ireland is also wary of an EU response that includes a digital services tax on US tech giants \u2013 a move the Taoiseach told The Irish Times he would oppose and which Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers said on Sunday would signal that \u201cwe\u2019re at a point of enormous damage for the Irish economy\u201d. The unpredictability of the US position was further underlined over the weekend when the Trump administration said that it would exempt smartphones, computers and some other electronic goods from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. The exclusions, published late on Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump\u2019s 125 per cent China tariff and his baseline 10 per cent global tariff on nearly all other countries \u2013 though the White House later indicated that Chinese products would still face an earlier 20 per cent tariff. The announcement came as a relief to Apple , a major Irish taxpayer which manufactures smartphones in China and which saw its share price plummet last week, knocking more than $600 billion (\u20ac528 billion) off the company\u2019s value. However, Mr Lutnick said on Sunday that the exemption was not permanent and such products would be re-examined as part of a government investigation into semiconductors, which face a separate round of tariffs. Senior EU and Irish sources say they hope that Monday\u2019s meeting can lay the groundwork for detailed negotiations between the EU and the US over the coming months. There is hope on the EU side that concessions to the US, such as easing existing tariffs on US cars and undertaking to purchase more American liquefied natural gas, could pave the way for the Trump administration to claim victory and set aside its EU tariffs. But the unpredictability of President Trump makes any expectations about the future unreliable. It is this uncertainty that is spooking global markets, which will be closely watched on Monday morning for signs of a continuing sell-off in US assets, identified by many analysts last week. Some market analysts say the Trump tariffs \u2013 and the increasingly unilateralist position of the US more generally \u2013 is prompting a retreat from US shares and bonds, a trend that could make financing the US government\u2019s huge deficit more difficult. A move away from US assets could also endanger the position of the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency \u2013 a move that would have far-reaching implications for the global financial system. EU foreign affairs ministers, including T\u00e1naiste Simon Harris , are expected to discuss the US tariffs on the margin of a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, though the agenda is dominated by Ukraine and Israel-Palestine.

After days of market mayhem, America\u2019s billionaires finally did something this week that few top bosses have done since Donald Trump took office in January: sound off about the US president\u2019s actions. Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs , they said, were a \u201chuge policy mistake\u201d born of \u201cstupidity\u201d that could spark an \u201ceconomic nuclear winter\u201d and in some cases amounted to \u201cbullshit\u201d. Talk about a gear shift. Until this market-melting moment, companies across the US had shown striking levels of deference to Trump\u2019s agenda. READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football Everyone wants a piece of the sport chat action It is hard to say if this will change after his tariff backdown, but what is clear is just how hard it is to deal with an administration bent on upending normal rules of business engagement. To start with, there is simple confusion. Last week I spoke to Nneka Chiazor, head of the Public Affairs Council in Washington, a non-partisan association of public affairs professionals from some of the largest US companies. She had just come back from meeting some of her members in Brussels, who peppered her with questions such as: \u201cCan we still say \u2018green\u2019?\u201d; \u201cIs \u2018clean\u2019 still okay?\u201d; \u201cWould it be okay if we participated in [New York] Climate Week?\u201d \u201cPeople are struggling with how to show respect for the US administration\u201d while honouring their commitments to customers and other stakeholders, she said. That struggle is harder when you see how fraught it can be for companies to do a U-turn on measures they once championed that do not chime with the Trump administration. \u201cEveryone looks completely hypocritical and directionless\u201d, said New York University professor Alison Taylor, author of Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World. \u201cThat has the impact of making anything that they say look completely implausible, which I don\u2019t think is super smart.\u201d Then there is financial risk. The number of shoppers visiting Target stores has fallen for nine weeks in a row since the retailer triggered a customer boycott with a January statement indicating it was pulling back from diversity initiatives it had long promoted, data from the Placer.ai analytics firm shows. In contrast, footfall has kept growing at Costco, which fought a shareholder proposal aimed at undermining its diversity and inclusion initiatives. Correlation is of course not causation. Many other factors could explain the difference. Target\u2019s trust and likeability score \u2013 a chief measure of reputation \u2013 did drop to a four-year low in the first quarter of this year, reckons market intelligence firm Caliber. But the Caliber surveys this is based on show it continues a downward trend that began years before Target\u2019s diversity retreat. Also, Caliber research on 10 big US companies including Target, Walmart and Apple indicates most had little or no change in their trust scores from the last quarter of 2024, regardless of whether they dropped or defended diversity measures. But employee trust is another matter. Consider the hundreds of associates from some of the world\u2019s largest law firms that have signed an open letter condemning the administration\u2019s targeting of firms it opposes. Imagine how they felt when some of their firms then caved in, pledging millions of dollars in pro bono services to administration-approved causes \u2013 a move that seems to have surprised even the president. Firms are saying \u201cWhere do I sign? Where do I sign?\u201d, Trump marvelled at the White House last month. \u201cNobody can believe it.\u201d Perhaps. History suggests companies are rarely at the vanguard of political resistance, no matter how high the stakes get. Dutch journalist David de Jong says that, in the years of research he did for his 2022 book Nazi Billionaires, he came across just two examples of major industrialists or companies defying Nazi Germany. Robert Bosch, founder of the eponymous engineering and technology group, and steel tycoon Fritz Thyssen. Charles Hecker\u2019s 2024 book Zero Sum offers another lesson about the foreign companies that kept doing business in an increasingly authoritarian Russia. In one telling example, a senior European executive reveals these firms\u2019 corporate headquarters were \u201cwagging their fingers\u201d about Moscow\u2019s illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, while urging their Russian offices to boost sales next year. The US of 2025 is no Russia of 2014, let alone 1930s Germany. All the same, any US company that bends to an administration uncommonly determined to bring its adversaries to heel is following a familiar path. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Donald Trump United States US tariffs IN THIS SECTION Q&A: How will the Government\u2019s new plan to support businesses affect workers?

Much attention has focused on the mag seven\u2019s growing influence on index returns, given they account for 30 per cent of the S&P 500\u2032s market capitalisation and 17 per cent of the MSCI All-Cap World Index\u2019s (ACWI).

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft.

This includes a couple of highly anticipated features including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as the ability to switch the \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound when driving at low speeds. Latest Proton e.MAS 7 OTA update schedule As shared by Pro-Net product expert David Tiah, Proton e.MAS 7 has recently received an April OTA (Over-the-air) update which adds the Start/Stop charging button on the main central display, optimised braking experience and the ability to view the EV\u2019s location when the car is asleep. For those who are waiting for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, he revealed that Wireless Apple CarPlay is coming in the Q2 Update that\u2019s expected to be pushed by July 2025, while Wired Apple CarPlay is coming in Q3 Update (By October 2025). For Android users, Wired and Wireless Android Auto is expected to arrive in Q4 (by December 2025). Other known usability complaints and feedback are also being addressed as well via OTA. Pro-Net will be giving users to change the AVAS (Ice Cream Truck) sound and bug fixes for Radio scan in the Q2 Update which is expected to be pushed by July. Meanwhile, the permanent speed warning sound memory switch will be added in the Q3 Update which is expected to be pushed by October 2025. As announced earlier , Wireless Apple CarPlay was supposed to be delivered by June. When we asked them about the delay, Pro-Net said they are taking a little bit more time for certification and testing to ensure that the feature works well for all users when it is rolled out. Proton e.MAS app to integrate Shell Recharge chargers very soon At the moment, Proton e.MAS 7 users can experience seamless EV charger discovery, activation and payment directly from the Proton e.MAS app. Through the Proton e.MAS app, users can get access to almost 90% of public chargers in the country from various Charge Point Operators (CPO). As a result, there\u2019s no longer a need to download multiple charging apps from every single CPO. After integrating Charge+ and RExcharge chargers last month, Pro-Net Deputy Head of Charging Ahmad Munif Halim reveals that Shell Recharge will soon be integrated in the app. Tags: Android Auto Apple CarPlay Charge Plus Electric Vehicle EV EV Charger EV charging Pro-Net Proton Proton e.Mas 7 Shell Recharge Alexander Wong POPULAR Proton e.MAS 7: Wireless Apple CarPlay and \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound switch coming in July via OTA Update April 14, 2025 MGS5 EV confirmed for Malaysia: Should BYD, Proton be worried?

In a surprise move, the President\u2019s administration officially announced that Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, including the brutal 125% levy that had companies like Apple and Samsung on edge. According to a notice from US Customs and Border Patrol, these devices are now exempt from Trump\u2019s global 10% tariff and the much bigger China-specific import tax. That\u2019s a big deal. Some early estimates suggested that iPhone prices could have tripled if companies like Apple had passed the extra costs on to consumers. The timing of this exemption feels especially critical. Apple, for one, manufactures about 80% of its iPhones for the US market in China. Without relief, they were looking at an impossible situation: either swallow the cost or jack up prices. It\u2019s the same story for Samsung, which has been trying to diversify its supply chain to avoid over-reliance on China, with India and Vietnam stepping in as alternative hubs. Of course, not every tech product is safe. Game consoles, for example, have already felt the squeeze. Nintendo reportedly delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US because of these tariffs. Trump\u2019s tariff policy has been aggressive across the board. He raised China-specific import taxes to 145%, blaming Beijing\u2019s 84% retaliatory tariffs for the hike. The White House is spinning this as a negotiating tactic. Trump claims the endgame is fairer trade, fewer supply chain dependencies, and more factories returning to American soil. Whether or not that works is still up for debate. But for now, with Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, US tech companies\u2014and anyone eyeing a new iPhone\u2014can breathe a little easier.

The article has been amended to reflect the new details. MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with an estimated price tag that starts at RM115,000 . This was revealed during SAIC Motor Malaysia \u2019s media preview session today, which marked the electric SUV\u2019s first official outing in our market. Expected to be a major rival to current market darlings such as Proton e.MAS 7 and BYD Atto 3 Ultra, the MGS5 EV will be available in Malaysia in two main variants. However, the company did not reveal the specific pricing for each variant, which is something that they are saving for the official launch this May. MGS5 EV Malaysia quick specs Built with a rear-wheel drive setup, the MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with two battery configurations. The base-spec model is powered by a 49kWh LFP battery, which allows the variant to deliver a WLTP-rated range of 340km alongside a DC charging speed of 120kW. On the other hand, the high-spec MGS5 EV for Malaysia is equipped with a 62.2kWh LFP battery. It also has a much higher WLTP-rated range of 430km and supports a DC charging speed of up to 150kW. For the electric motor though, things are slightly unclear. This is because the presentation slide and press release only mentioned the 125kW (168hp) electric motor which also produces 250Nm of torque. However, the presentation slide during the preview event said that the MGS5 EV has a 0-100km/h timing of 6.1 seconds. This figure did not match the century timing for the 125kW motor which is supposed to be around 8 seconds. The 6.1 seconds 0-100km/h timing is supposed to be for the 180kW (242hp) electric motor as per the one that was fitted to the high-spec MGS5 EV in Thailand. We have reached out to SAIC Motor Malaysia\u2019s representative to obtain further clarifications but were told that more details will only be announced during the public launch this May. Meanwhile, both MGS5 EV variants do share a lot of features with each other. They include the 6.6kW AC charging, Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) capability, a 12.8-inch infotainment display, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto, MG Pilot Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), and 7 airbags. The electric SUV also supports the MG iSMART mobile app that allows owners to remotely lock or unlock their car, check its location and charging status, as well as control the climate settings. You can also use the app to transform your phone into a digital key for the EV. At the same time, the high-spec MGS5 EV also has a long list of extra features. Among them include 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a powered tailgate, MG perforated pattern on the seats, a heated leather steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat, 6 premium audio speakers, rear reading lamps, rain-sensing wipers and a 360-degree surround-view camera. In terms of colourways, the MGS5 EV in Malaysia includes Arctic White, Monument Silver, Camden Grey, and Dynamic Red as well as the Elegant Latte which is reserved for the high-spec model. The electric SUV comes standard with a dark interior as well as seats made out of a leather and fabric combination.

Written by Shaurya Tomer , Edited by Siddharth Suvarna | Updated: 14 April 2025 10:06 IST Apple is expected to preview the iPadOS 19 update at WWDC 2025 in June Highlights Apple may bring Mac-like functionality to iPad models with iPadOS 19 It is reported to improve multitasking, productivity and app management iPadOS 19 overhaul is said to be one of the key agendas at WWDC 2025 Advertisement Apple is said to be working on a major overhaul of iPadOS , the operating system (OS) which powers the iPad. According to claims by a seasoned journalist, the Cupertino-based technology giant's next iteration of iPadOS, i PadOS 19 , could make the iPad operating system more like macOS. With several iPad models getting an upgrade to the latest M4 chipset, Apple is reportedly gearing up to focus on delivering more productivity and improving the multitasking capabilities of its tablets. iPadOS 19 Overhaul This information comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In the latest edition of the Power On newsletter , the journalist claims that revamping the iPadOS software will be one of the key agendas during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) 2025, which kicks off on June 9. With recent upgrades to iPad models, hardware capabilities of the tablets have left behind its software. So far, the iPad OS has been an extension of iOS , offering similar features adapted to a larger screen size. However, users have been asking for more \u2014 more features, more multitasking capabilities, and more productivity. And it seems like Apple will finally listen. As per Gurman, the iPhone maker is aiming to make the iPad operate more like a Mac. Moto Book 60 Laptop, Moto Pad 60 Pro Tablet to Debut on This Date With iPadOS 19, it is said to focus on improving productivity, multitasking and app window management. This report contradicts more context to past information by the same journalist who suggested that Apple's next-generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac OS versions would focus more on delivering visual changes than adding new features. Previous claims by Gurman suggest that the company will minimise the visual differences across devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and the Apple Vision Pro and deliver a more cohesive experience. Thus, its operating systems may come with user interface (UI) elements akin to visionOS, the OS powering the spatial headset. While official details remain scarce, one of the rumoured changes is glass effects throughout the UI. Oppo Pad 4 Pro Launched With Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 12,140mAh Battery Apple's iPad Fold and iPhone Fold Could Launch Next Year As per the journalist, Apple aims to eliminate differences in system actions such as hamburger menus and menu buttons, the menu bar, and button for closing applications. Some applications are suggested to get reworked to aid a new generation of users in better understanding their devices.

Upgrade Now Morning Bid: Doing the tariff two-step German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt \u00b7 Reuters Reuters Sun, Apr 13, 2025, 9:33 PM 3 min read (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole So the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are off smartphones and some electronics, but maybe only for a while as they could get their own special tariff once the White House has completed a study of the global supply chain. Or something. Indeed, Trump on Sunday told reporters tariffs on semiconductors would be announced over the next week and a decision on phones made \"soon\". Essentially more of the same chaos. How anyone running a company can decide on long-term investments in such conditions is a mystery, which has limited the boost to Wall Street futures for the moment. The S&P 500 was up around 0.8% and the Nasdaq 1.2%, though you would have to assume Apple shares, at least, will benefit in the near term. European stock futures have actually performed better, perhaps on speculation that President Trump will blink on other levies, too. Or it could be investors are buying Europe now that U.S. exceptionalism and \"exorbitant privilege\" - the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency - are under such threat. The dollar is certainly feeling unloved, falling back under 143.00 yen and extending last week's 5% slide on the Swiss franc. The euro is knocking on $1.1400 again and even the high-beta Aussie and kiwi are up, a sure sign the dollar's safe-haven status is in jeopardy. Apparently, Japanese officials are gearing up for trade negotiations with the United States that will likely touch on currency policy, with some officials privately bracing for Washington to call on Tokyo to prop up the yen. Should the White House actively start talking the dollar down, it will spook those offshore investors with unhedged positions in U.S. assets - which is most of them. At least Treasuries are steadier, though they show little sign of reversing last week's astonishing 50-basis-point jump in longer-term yields. If sustained, that's a material tightening in financial conditions and a deadweight for the housing market, adding another reason for the Fed to ease even if inflation is heading higher. It will be interesting to see if the New York Fed survey of inflation expectations due later on Monday shows the same kind of spike seen in the University of Michigan numbers. Retail sales data for March on Wednesday could be strong as consumers rushed to buy autos and other goods before the tariffs go into effect. Fed Chair Powell also has a chance to provide his outlook on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago, where the Q&A should be lively. Markets imply a 20% chance of a May rate cut, rising to almost 80% for June. Some 80 basis points of easing are priced in for the year, though that was up around 130 basis points this time last week.

The response has been chaotic. Companies like Framework, which specializes in modular laptops, and Nintendo, with its game consoles, were hit especially hard. Framework had to pause sales of some laptop models in the US . Nintendo also delayed pre-orders of the recently announced Switch 2 , in order to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\" As the backlash grew, the Trump administration pulled back slightly by announcing exemptions for key electronics like smartphones, laptops, memory cards, and semiconductors. Now, reports indicate the exemption of smartphones, laptops, and other electronics will be short-lived. CNN highlighted comments made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, where he stated that the exemptions will be short-lived, with new tariffs targeting electronics already in the works.

Hours later, Trump made a post on Truth Social , where he claimed that no such exemptions exist, as products like smartphones and laptops remain subject to existing tariffs, specifically the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs. NOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u201cbucket.\u201d The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Trump administration hopes that the tariffs will make the US less reliant on countries like China in terms of manufacturing . Industry executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook have reiterated that manufacturing in China is not because of cheap labour, but due to a shortage of skilled labour elsewhere, a sentiment that Elon Musk also shares.

SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. Reuters TSMC , the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 54% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though is also likely to flag risk from trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a trend towards implementing AI features in online products. But the firm faces headwind not just from Trump's import tariffs but also his criticism of Taiwan's dominance of the chip industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is set to report net profit of T$347.8 billion ($10.74 billion) for the three months through March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 17 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2024 first-quarter net profit of T$225.5 billion. TSMC has been spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, though it said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. It announced a $100 billion investment with Trump at the White House last month, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona. Live Events Trump has both praised Taiwan's chip industry and threatened it with tariffs. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Last week, he said he had told TSMC it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if it did not build factories in the U.S. On Sunday, he said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from tariffs on China will be short-lived, pledging a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector. \"The company will likely double down on overseas fab investments to mitigate the geopolitical risk, despite two to three percentage points of gross margin dilution for the next five years,\" said SemiAnalysis analyst Sravan Kundojjala. \"This will likely ensure TSMC gets favourable treatment from the U.S. government and minimise the tariff burden.\" Apple's iPhones, given they are mainly made in China, is another risk area for TSMC, said Cathay Futures analyst Venson Tsai. \"If the iPhone can't be sold, then TSMC's chips can't either,\" Tsai said. TSMC last week reported a surge in first-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, slightly ahead of market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. It will also update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure for production increases. On its last earnings call in January, TSMC said it expected capital spending this year to be $38 billion to $42 billion, an increase of as much as 41% from last year.

See full bio Edward Moyer April 12, 2025 12:49 p.m. PT 2 min read James Martin/CNET Another twist in the tariff saga: Smartphones , laptops and other consumer electronics may not see soaring prices due to tariffs after all, at least for the time being. Late Friday, the Trump administration exempted such products from the reciprocal tariffs it had imposed earlier, including the 125% fees levied on imports from China, where many tech and electronics products are manufactured. A notice to shippers posted late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection included a list of tariff codes for product categories that won't be subject to the fees. Code 8471 covers computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing, Reuters reported . Flat panel displays, memory chips and semiconductors will also sidestep the tariff fees, the news outlet said. Industry observers had feared massive price hikes on tech and other gear as a result of tariffs, and concerns had prompted some consumers to rush to buy iPhones and other products. Apple Store employees saw an uptick in foot traffic last weekend, with one worker telling Bloomberg that the surge felt like the holiday shopping season. It's unclear whether the exemption will stay in place, however, with both Bloomberg and The New York Times reporting that different tariff fees may end up affecting electronics equipment down the line. What this means for you If your head's spinning over all the back-and-forth tariff developments, you're definitely not alone. What does it mean for the prices you'll see when crossing things off your shopping list? The short answer is: Don't be surprised if you wind up paying more for at least some goods and services. For details, you can check out our Tariffs Explained piece. And before this latest news, we asked CNET experts to give us their best predictions and advice when it comes to shopping for tech products like laptops, phones, TVs and more. See their responses in our Buy or Wait guide. Although a CNET survey showed that some people are rushing to buy tech gear before anticipated price rises, experts caution against busting out the credit card. If you already had your eye on a particular product and you'd set aside the money for it, buying now, or during an upcoming sale, could help you save money. It could also help you breathe a little easier. But again, be wary of taking on debt. Find out more here .

It doesn't have a great app to go alongside it; it's not the most powerful power station, and it's not the sleekest, but the one thing this power station has is the ease of charging.

I've got countless memories of grabbing some Duracell batteries to throw in toys, remotes, and other tools growing up, all the way up to toys for my kids. Duracell is a well-known, highly-reputable company that people recognize and trust. Having reviewed the best portable power stations , I can confidently say this one is meant for everyday use, has excellent ports, and is a simple backup for essentials. However, what sets this power station apart is not the bold design, port offering, power output, or capacity. What sets this apart is that you can recharge it with a standard AC extension cord. There is no fancy proprietary charger or IEC cable that swears on the cable that you can only use for that power station. Any AC extension cable will do.

They offer a smaller variant, but if you're going with this company, I'd choose this larger one for portable power stations. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Unboxing & first impressions When I first found the Duracell G800, I thought it was a gimmick. A power station resembling a famous battery wouldn't work well. But, once I got it, I was proven wrong. The build quality is excellent, the packaging is professional and straightforward, the handle is comfortable to carry, the port offering is fantastic, and then I noticed the way to charge, and I realized this is working hard to compete right out of the gate. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Design & build quality Specs Battery Capacity: 620Wh Output: 800W (shared across 3 AC ports) Ports: \u2022 3x AC Outlets (total 800W shared) \u2022 3x USB-A (7.2A shared) \u2022 2x USB-C (100W per port, 200W total) \u2022 1x Car charger port (120W max) Weight: 19.4 lbs Dimensions: 12.5\u201d x 8.3\u201d x 11.5\u201d The Duracell G800 is a unique look. It's got a bronze top half to resemble the famous battery, but what's great is that Duracell chose to make the line between the black and copper a ring light, helping light whatever you may be trying to plug in, in the dark, without power, thus the need for a power station. Further, the handle is solid and firm, and there is some integrated storage on the backside of the power station to help carry the power cable or any USB-C/USB-A cables. Thankfully, all the main ports are on the front, which I appreciate. It makes for a portable power station that is easy to use, allowing for this to be set down and forgotten about while charging whatever you may be keeping charged. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: In use Admittedly, I've had this G800 for around 160 days. However, in that time, I've had my team put this thing to the test in real-life scenarios. I've had this power station help out when charging cameras on the go out of the back of my Jeep, charging iPads and computers on a long trip, and being a light source and emergency power in a power outage. I've had this power station help out my family in Florida during the crazy hurricanes this last year. In all the scenarios, this power station functioned great. The handle makes it easy to maneuver in all of these environments, and the forward-facing ports mean that all ports are accessible simultaneously. Throughout my time testing, the most standout feature is that this unit recharges with a standard AC extension cord outlet. One thing that makes a power station less usable is when it has a proprietary charger or a unique charger that works only for that unit. It makes recharging more cumbersome, more challenging in many ways, and more expensive if you ever damage or misplace your charger. With Duracell, they chose to go the opposite route of an Apple with the (late) Lightning cable, and they decided to go with a cable option that is nearly everywhere (in the US). This may be an intentional move, or it's beginner's luck; regardless, I am a fan. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) While testing, I got this power station recharged to an impressive 80 percent in about an hour, just as Duracell suggests. I got my 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro fully recharged about 8.5 times, depending on just how heavily I ran it when plugged in (I run my computers hard with all that I do in a day). Duracell promotes being able to run a Wi-Fi router for around 26 hours, a TV (very generic) for 5 hours, a mini cooler for 22 hours, a drone for 26 charges, and lights for 6.7 hours. If you want to extend your off-grid power, plug in a G-Solar Panel to recharge the power station directly from the sun.

Sadly, it does not have app control, but it does have nice features such as a built-in light ring and that handy ability to recharge with a simple standard AC extension cord.

Marathon Closed Alpha Begins In April, Here's How To Sign Up Want to try the next game from Halo and Destiny developer Bungie? Now's your chance. By Eddie Makuch on April 12, 2025 at 11:00AM PDT 2 Comments Where to buy Marathon There are currently no available deals GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers. As part of the Bungie's reveal showcase for its next game, Marathon, the studio announced a closed alpha test and confirmed how players can sign up for access. The Marathon closed alpha starts later this month, and players can join the Marathon Discord channel for a chance to get in. Bungie said its teams will be \"actively engaging\" with the Discord channel, including conducting live Q&As and generally discussing the project directly with fans. Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter. It's a successor of sorts to Bungie's 1994 game of the same name. Whereas Bungie today is better known for its work on the Destiny and Halo franchises, the original Marathon was one of Bungie's first big successes when it was released for Mac and Apple Pippin. Marathon 2: Durandal followed in 1995, with Marathon Infinity coming in 1996. It wasn't until 2001 that Bungie truly broke out in a major way with the debut of Halo: Combat Evolved. Sony now owns Bungie, but the new Marathon is in the works for platforms beyond the PS5 alone, including Xbox Series X|S and PC--cross-play is supported across all platforms. Marathon will mark Bungie's first big new release since Sony acquired the company in 2022. Marathon launches on September 23 , the same day as Borderlands 4.

TV presenter and author Ali Mau, who has written her memoir titled No Words for This. Photo / Dean Purcell Warning: This episode contains discussion about sexual abuse Broadcaster and author Ali Mau feels that people shouldn\u2019t be shocked by revelations she experienced sexual assault as a child. The former TV presenter has shared her life story in her memoir, No Words for This , published last month. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In it, she details publicly for the first time the sexual assault she experienced from her father, who also abused her sister and nephew. Speaking to Paula Bennett on her NZ Herald podcast Ask Me Anything , Mau said a lot of people have told her they are surprised by her story, but she doesn\u2019t think they should feel that way as it is \u201cso common\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll have heard that statistic, one in three women, one in seven men experience sexual harm in their lifetime \u2013 and these are official police figures. \u201c[That\u2019s] 930,000 New Zealanders have experienced, not necessarily exactly what I experienced, but some kind of sexual harm in their lifetime. It\u2019s almost a million people. \u201cSo the surprising thing is not that it happened at all. The surprise comes from the fact that we don\u2019t talk about it enough. It is, I believe, the last big taboo subject in our society. And it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Advertisement Advertise with NZME. She said that is why she wrote the book, because these conversations need to be had and should be had. \u201cIf you think 10 or 15 years ago, we were, as a society, not able to talk about domestic violence. And then a bunch of incredibly committed women have worked over that time to change that around completely and make it a national conversation that we can have to the point where one of the biggest retailers in the country sponsors women\u2019s refuge. \u201cI believe we can do that with sexual harm as well.\u201d Mau has spoken to hundreds of sexual harm survivors, men and women, and said they often speak of a level of shame or self-blame. She said she was able to apply that to herself when telling her story. Mau is now working on a charity, Tika, to help victims get legal support. She is launching it with barrister Zoe Lorton and it is a concept they have been working on since 2018. When they started exploring the issue, they found that only 7% of sexual harm victims report their case, and the figure had not changed in a decade. \" I naively had assumed that all the awareness-raising would move the needle on that, and it hadn\u2019t.\" Tika, when it launches later this year, is an online platform that will allow victims to input details about their perpetrator and get connected with a lawyer to find out what their legal route forwards is. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. \" It\u2019s a game changer. Do you know that you cannot, even at this point, report sexual harm online? You have to walk into a police station or phone and speak to a uniformed officer at the front desk. \u201cWhen you think about the generations of my children\u2019s age and younger, they do everything on their phone. \u201cSo being able to offer a secure platform that they can trust, that will tell them whether anybody else has been harmed by the same person, even just that step is incredibly powerful for somebody who\u2019s been unsure about what to do, but in the back of their mind, they know they\u2019re looking for some kind of accountability and justice.\u201d Listen to the full episode for more from Ali Mau about sharing her story and how she wants to help victims, as well as reflections on her broadcasting career, her public relationship and subsequent divorce from Simon Dallow, and how it felt to be outed.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 President Donald Trump 's decision to exempt many electronics from newly implemented tariffs has sparked surprise from critics, with some citing recent remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to quip about the latest scaling back of the controversial economic policy. Newsweek reached out to the White House and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for comment on Saturday. Why It Matters Earlier this week, Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect for several hours before he paused most of them for 90 days\u2014with the notable exception of China. The United States and China remain in a tit-for-tat trade war, with Trump hiking the 104 percent tariffs on China to 125 percent on Wednesday after Beijing hit back at the U.S. with an 84 percent additional levy earlier in the day. Trump's total tariffs now stand at 145 percent on Chinese goods, while China has imposed a 125 percent tariff, dismissing Trump's strategy as \"a joke.\" As recently as last Sunday, Lutnick said that tariffs would allow smartphone manufacturing to happen in the U.S., instead of abroad. But the Friday announcement of the electronics exemption suggests manufactures will no longer have the immediate incentive to consider producing smartphones and other electronics in the U.S. What to Know A Friday evening update from CBP exempted smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts from the tariffs. The decision was retroactive to as early as April 5. The exemption list includes products the U.S. heavily relies on for overseas production, with limited domestic manufacturing capacity and high consumer demand. Companies such as Apple , which carries out 90 percent of its iPhone manufacturing in China, are set to benefit from the exemptions. \"Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a statement, CNN reported. \"A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend.\" While tech companies may be breathing a sigh of relief, some critics of Trump's tariffs took to X, formerly Twitter , on Saturday to joke about the decision and remind their followers of the administration's own words regarding the tariffs.

Trump literally said there would be 'no exemptions' to his reciprocal tariffs (see video) and MAGA cheered. 'No, with reciprocal [tariffs] you don't need to,' he said. Now, suddenly he's backtracking again and adding a bunch of exemptions to his reciprocal tariffs. And MAGA is cheering yet again. It's almost as if he has no idea what he's doing and MAGA doesn't stand for anything except whatever Trump says and does.\" Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and prominent Trump critic, wrote on X: \"More exemptions, so the question remains: If tariffs are so great, why so many exemptions?\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on X: \"So these exemptions on electronics from China... Is this how we should see it? 'We are imposing a 145% tariff on all Chinese goods -except what we buy.'\" Keith Olbermann, a political commentator, on X: \"Trump: Tariffs are perfect and beautiful and mandatory and I won't back down. Also Trump: here are 37,498 tariff exemptions for companies who've greased me.\" Tahra Jirari, director of economic analyst at Progress Chamber, on X: \"Incredible. Someone check on Lutnick, I know he wanted us screwing millions of smartphones.\" Sar Haribhakti, who leads global product communications at Stripe, on X: \"Five days ago: Lutnick: 'The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u2014that kind of thing is going to come to America.' Last night:\" Haribhakti reposted the news about the tariff exemptions on electronics. Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, on X : \"More caving (thank goodness). What is the strategy here? President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock.\" President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10 in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10 in Washington, D.C. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images What Officials Are Saying Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to CBS News' Face the Nation last Sunday: \"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u2014that kind of thing is going to come to America.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a Saturday statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" President Donald Trump, in a Wednesday post on Truth Social: \"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\" China's Finance Ministry, in a statement: \"The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.\" What Happens Next? The exemptions are already in effect. Tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, with no sign that other tariffs will be reduced anytime soon. Many other nations are reportedly in the process of negotiating with the Trump administration during the ongoing 90-day pause announced this week. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

Todd is the guest on this week\u2019s edition of Mediaite\u2019s new Press Club podcast , hosted by Aidan McLaughlin , to discuss the media, the news of the day, and life after NBC News, which he left in January after nearly two decades. In the episode, now out on YouTube and podcast platforms, McLaughlin asked Todd about Trump\u2019s tariffs and the resulting stock market roller coaster this week: AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: Trump finally consummated his decades-long flirtation with tariffs. Have you looked at your portfolio this week? CHUCK TODD: I\u2019m over 50, I\u2019m having to look at it every hour. No, I mean, and that\u2019s this, that\u2019s the dirty little, you know what I took his biggest political problem, is that when you\u2019re of a certain age, you start looking at this every day. You know, this whole, \u201cwell people don\u2019t look at the stock market every day.\u201d. Yeah, but the people who are most likely to vote in midterms, they do. They pay attention to if the Social Security office is taking their phone calls. Like, he is rattling constituencies that are the ones that are most likely to show up to vote. Right? So it\u2019s just one of those, you\u2019re like, this is why this could be politically catastrophic. AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: So yeah, so we\u2019re in very much uncharted territory right now. CHUCK TODD: And then some. Todd went on to explain why the chaotic tariff roll-out could be Trump\u2019s \u201cAfghanistan moment\u201d \u2014 a reference to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to a collapse of former President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings, a collapse he never recovered from. He explained: Afghanistan became a competency question. And I think this tariff business for Trump becomes a competency question. \u2018Wait a minute, you went about this all wrong and you caused an economic tsunami. We agree we needed to do it, but you don\u2019t know how to do.\u2019 And in some ways, competency is actually more lethal here than the ideological distinction between the two. And this is why I think he\u2019s probably never going to be over \u2014 barring some we don\u2019t know, rallying around the president because we\u2019re in war or something like this \u2014 I don\u2019t if he ever gets over 45 [percent approval rating] again.

It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145 per cent tariffs levied on China or the 10 per cent baseline tariffs elsewhere. It\u2019s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The goal is to encourage more domestic manufacturing. But the exemptions seem to acknowledge that the current electronics supply chain is virtually all in Asia and it will be challenging to shift that to the US. For example, about 90 per cent of iPhones are produced and assembled in China, according to Wedbush Securities. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing US Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Trump previously said he would consider exempting some companies from tariffs. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment early Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would delay many of the market-shaking tariffs that he\u2019d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he\u2019d already imposed on goods from China). There\u2019s been plenty of speculation about what the tariffs will mean for the tech industry , which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump\u2019s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy . Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are \u201cexcluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,\u201d with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit \u2014 until last night\u2019s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as \u201ca dream scenario for tech investors.\u201d Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigation into semiconductors. And indeed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these products would be included in \u201cthe semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.\u201d This post has been updated with Howard Lutnick\u2019s comments about the tariffs.

Mythic Quest, the Apple TV Plus comedy about a game studio, isn\u2019t getting a fifth season, reports Variety . And, like a developer issuing a farewell patch, Apple is updating the final episode of season four with a new \u201cgoodbye\u201d ending next week. Variety published a statement from Mythic Quest \u2019s executive producers: \u201cEndings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close,\u201d said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\u201d The news comes just weeks after a report that Apple has been losing $1 billion a year on TV Plus. The show just wrapped up its fourth season and released a f our-episode spinoff called Side Quest on March 26th. One of the early Apple TV Plus shows, Mythic Quest tells the story of Mythic Quest Studios, a fictional games studio led by Ian Grimm, Rob McElhenney\u2019s parody of a visionary tech founder bro, and Charlotte Nicdao\u2019s Poppy Li, an awkward but brilliant engineer who serves as his co-creative director. Throughout the series, Mythic Quest sent up the tech industry, from lampooning startup culture to raising some of the gaming world\u2019s darker ethical questions . But to echo an early Verge write-up of Mythic Quest , you don\u2019t need to understand any of that to enjoy the show. Mythic Quest also stars David Hornsby, Ashly Burch, Imani Hakim, Danny Pudi, Jessie Ennis, Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton.

See Full Bio MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle (MSNBC screenshot) MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle appeared with her old hosting partner Ali Velshi on Saturday morning to weigh in on a major announcement from Donald Trump's administration on Chinese imports. In a bulletin posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday, the administration announced smartphones, computers, and assorted electronics would be exempt from the ruinous 145% percent tariffs imposed on other Chinese products. As Ruhle, a former hedge fund trader put it, \"This is huge.\" Speaking with Velshi, she elaborated, \"So just imagine all the big electronics that we get that's manufactured in China , right? Chips, semiconductors, TVs, cell phones \u2013\u2013 all the big electronics out there are now going to be tariff-free. I mean, Ali, this is extraordinary.\" \"It's kind of like saying we're going to impose 100 plus percent tariffs on everything we buy from China, except for what we actually buy from them,\" she dryly quipped. \"It's sort of crazy because we haven't even started negotiating, you know, this trade war and already we're making this announcement.\" \"It's mind-blowing i n that in the last week what have we done,\" she added. \"The president announced the moves on tariff, we saw the stock market crater, we saw the bond market get whacked, which is the most concerning because it means people don't have faith in the U.S.\". \"We saw consumer confidence absolutely crater and businesses big and small fall into an absolute panic, given what an enormous trading partner China is, but also countries around the world, but focusing just on china, man, if you are [ Apple head] Tim Cook or the other big tech CEO's who gave big and went to Trump's inauguration, you are glad you did that,\" she observed.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2. A pack of 120 retainer cleaner tablets because it turns out your Invisalign is supposed to be ~clear~ (it also works on mouthguards and dentures!). All you do is drop a tablet into warm tap water, let your dental device soak for a few minutes, and voila! \u2014 it'll kill bacteria and remove the buildup that's causing discoloration and unpleasant odors. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really loved this product. I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3. A new pair of workout leggings to replace the super pilled ones you wear three times a week. They're made with a thick, buttery soft fabric (no one is seeing those hot pink undies) and have ~pockets~ so you don't have to carry your phone around the gym. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"THESE...are the best leggings I have ever worn in my entire life! They are so smooth and comfortable. Soft as butter. They fit perfectly. It almost feels like you're naked but they feel somehow insulated and cozy. Stretchy and made of amazingly durable quality. I need to get more colors!\" \u2014 Alexandra Shick Get them from Amazon for $24.98 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL, in three inseam lengths, and 45 colors). 4. A pack of AirPods cleaning putty because it's so embarrassing when you want to share earbuds with someone, but yours are coated in wax and dust. Plus, it's soooo satisfying to squish the lil' square into your speaker and see all the gunk it pulls out \u2014 and then you get to enjoy clearer, louder-sounding music! www.amazon.com Before you toss your tech in the trash, at least give this a try. Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used! SO happy I found a solution!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get 24 squares from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two pack sizes). 5. A veggie chopper for keeping your counter tidy while speeding up your prep time. If you love to cook but hate chopping (who doesn\u2019t, right?), this thing is a lifesaver. It chops just about everything \u2014 onions, peppers, zucchinis, potatoes, you name it! Plus, it comes with different blades for slicing, dicing, and even spiraling your favorite veggies. www.amazon.com , Amazon Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: \"If you cook, you need this product! I have had this chopper since 2018 and it is by far my favorite kitchen purchase. I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it has held up great. I just bought my MIL one for Christmas and she already loves how much easier it has made meal prep . It is well made and I like that there are different attachments and sizes. I would recommend this chopper!\" \u2014 Steph Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in five colors and five sets). 6. A pack of two antimicrobial \"flossing toothbrushes\" because your current one looks like it was used to scrub the bathroom floor (no offense). This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7. A WD-40 pen if your squeaky cabinets are driving you up the wall. It's way less messy than traditional spray methods, and reviewers love the precision this pen offers \u2014 perfect for getting into tight spaces and silencing those squeaks once and for all. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" \u2014 BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.99 . 8. A wall-mounted organizer to handle those annoying brooms, mops, rakes, and shovels that are always falling over.

Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks. Spray bottles and cleaning product bottles hang perfectly on there too.\" \u2014 Kavita Chandanie Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two sizes and two colors). 9. A set of double-sided shower rings that make changing your shower curtain or liner easier than it's ever been. Since you hang the curtain on one side and the liner on the other, you'll avoid the hassle of taking the whole thing down every time you switch the curtain/liner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is one of those items you didn\u2019t know you needed, and once you get it, you can\u2019t help but wonder how you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

Promising review: \"I have had chronic issues with pain caused by severely knotted muscles. This massager changed my life! I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier! The only downside is that public restrooms don't have these and I kind of can't go without it lol.

And if you want more Squatty Potty content before making this life-changing purchase, check out our Squatty Potty review ! Promising review: \"I'll do you all the courtesy of NOT adding a photo or video (You're welcome). This works. Whoever invented the toilet had their heart in the right place, but not their knees.

Promising review: \"I love these knives! I\u2019ve had them for a year now and I haven\u2019t had to sharpen them. Good grip, durable, and easy to handle. I hand wash them because we don\u2019t have a dishwasher but they\u2019re very easy to clean. I love the blade covers. It makes them safe for putting them in a drawer. I love not having a big knife block on my counter. Lightweight. They have not rusted.\" \u2014 Nvs Get the 12-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available in a 10-piece set). 15. A spice drawer organizer so you can finally have the neatly arranged, easy-to-find collection of spices you've always wanted.

It's basically like skincare for your driveway! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"The scene: me with a hot glove carrying a drip pan full of au jus. Thumb goes into hot liquid. Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17. A set of gold cable organizers you can stick to your desk or nightstand to hold those cords that are always falling to the ground or getting tangled.

Brighttia / Etsy Brighttia is a New York-based Etsy shop established in 2018 that specializes in industrial and modern interior lighting and decor. Promising review: \"These brass cable organizers are beautiful and high quality. I\u2019m using two of them to keep a plug-in sconce cord attached to the wall and to direct the cord to the electrical outlet. These little gold pieces add a touch of functionality and glamour to the sconces. Exactly what I was looking for.\" \u2014 Amy Margolis Get a set of four from Brighttia on Etsy for $22.98 (available in 12 colors). 18. A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur. It's reusable and works its magic without using anything sticky (so no residue)! This gadget went super viral based on its results \u2014 and that's when you know a product is good. Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine. This breaks down stains and odors at their source, leaving your home smelling fresh and citrusy without using harsh ingredients. That one spot behind the couch that your cat won't stop peeing on doesn't stand a chance. \ud83d\udcaa www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product is amazing!!!! We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22. Some foaming garbage disposal cleaning packets to clean out all the gunk from your roommates who just don't understand the concept of throwing food in the garbage instead of down the sink. Just insert a packet into the disposal with hot water trickling to the side, then turn on the disposal and watch it fizz up \u2014 soon, those gag-worthy smells will be a thing of the past. Amazon Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you\u2019re left with a clean sink! I use with other drain cleaning products, but would 100% recommend for weekly maintenance.\" \u2014 Jessica Hamilton Get a four-pack from Amazon for $7.90 (available in a pack of two). 23. And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Reviewers love how comfortable they are to hold and how they *stay* sharp. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Aside from these being a very inexpensive and aesthetic-looking set, they have an excellent, smooth, molded grip that feels good in the hand. The blades are thick, tight, and strong. They are built to last decades. I absolutely love them! Being a teacher, I use them several times daily, all throughout the year. You will NOT be disappointed, (unless for some odd reason you get a defective pair) I promise! \ud83d\ude03\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\" \u2014 gr8female Get a three-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (available in eight color sets and packs of 24 or 36). 25. Bior\u00e9 blackhead removers to help remove all the gunk and buildup that's clogging up your pores.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

You want to squeeze as much life from a laptop or desktop computer as possible. Doing so can save a substantial amount of money over time, and stops you from contributing to mountains of e-waste . At the same time, dealing with an old, sluggish computer is a frustrating experience. If apps and websites are taking ages to load, it can seriously impact your productivity. At a certain point, the temptation to upgrade to a shiny, speedy new computer proves irresistible. A middle ground exists, which is to make sure your laptop or desktop lasts as long as possible. There are multiple tricks you can try when it starts to show its age\u2014tricks that could mean it stays usable for much longer than you expected. Cut down on the clutter You\u2019ll find several programs starting up with Windows or macOS. Screenshot: Apple One way to stretch the life of your computer is to reduce its load. Uninstall any apps you\u2019re not actively using, and keep your apps trim in terms of extensions and add-ons. We\u2019ve covered how to uninstall programs on Windows and macOS , and it\u2019s not difficult to do. Limiting the number of programs starting up with your computer can help too: It means fewer apps running in the background, freeing up more memory and other system resources. You can take care of this with a few clicks on both Windows and macOS . The more storage space you have the better. It gives your computer and its operating system room to breathe and get organized, and can improve performance. Uninstalling apps should help with this, but also be on the lookout for files that you no longer need or can move somewhere else. Choose some upgrades Some well-chosen upgrades can breathe new life into an old computer. While this is going to cost you money, it won\u2019t cost as much as a full upgrade would\u2014and it could mean you get several years of extra use out of your device. The right upgrade will depend on your system\u2019s specs, how much you have to spend, how easy the system is to upgrade, and how comfortable you are with opening up your computer. This is mostly for Windows PCs and for desktops, though a few limited laptop upgrades are sometimes possible. Upgrading the RAM or the storage on your computer are usually the best upgrades for getting the most bang from your bucks. It could be something as straightforward as buying an external hard drive to move files over to, for example. Install another operating system There are plenty of lightweight Linux distros to choose from. Screenshot: Lubuntu In the interests of doing more with older components, you can install a fresh operating system to replace Windows or macOS, one that\u2019s less demanding on your aging computer. This will wipe everything on your system though, so be sure to back up all of your important files and folders first. Linux is always a popular and completely free option, and it comes in many different flavors (known as distros). Some of them, such as Lubuntu , are designed to be as lightweight as possible. Have a browse around the web and you\u2019ll find many options to pick from, as well as detailed guides to how to make the switch. Then there\u2019s ChromeOS Flex , which essentially turns your Windows or Mac computer into a Chromebook. You\u2019re just running a web browser with a few extras, so older computers should be up to the challenge. As with Linux, this is free to do, and it\u2019s perfect if you spend most of your computing time in a web browser anyway. Use your computer for something else Then there\u2019s the option of using your computer for something else , rather than an all-purpose machine. One option is using your aging laptop or desktop as a media server: It doesn\u2019t have to do anything except stream audio and video to other devices on your network. Plex and Emby are two programs that can help. Or how about turning your ancient computer into a dedicated writing machine? This could work if your machine is so old that it\u2019s no longer getting security updates, so shouldn\u2019t really be connected to the web. Set up a word processor and you\u2019re good to go (you will need a USB drive to get your writing shared elsewhere, however). Repurposing your laptop or desktop doesn\u2019t save you from the cost of an upgrade, because you\u2019ll still need to buy another computer, but it does cut down on e-waste and does mean your hardware stays useful for longer. And when you do finally need to get rid of a computer, make sure you do it responsibly .

While the initial reciprocal tariffs will remain for imports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection shared some new exemptions on tech-related goods. The update was announced yesterday evening and follows various tariff increases, particularly on Chinese imports. The exemptions include many products we're excited to see get some relief. The complete list is available in the official bulletin, but it includes computers, smartphones, semiconductor chips, and other tech goods like flat panel TVs, solar cells, and flash drives. The most recent tariff increase from Trump was 145% on Chinese goods. This sent waves across the tech industry, as many realized the significant impact it would have on many tech products that we rely on, including laptops, desktops, CPUs, semiconductor chips, and any PC component. Large companies like Apple, HP, Dell , and more preemptively imported extra stock before the tariff announcement to skirt some of the impact. You may like Tech enthusiasts brace for Trump tariff price hikes on new components Nvidia may avoid recent tariffs on its AI servers \u2014 60% of Nvidia servers pass through Mexico, may be exempt from Trump tariff flurry These exemptions should benefit industry leaders and consumers alike, who have been anticipating serious price hikes on imported products. This should offset the price increases for customers and manufacturers who rely on imports for construction materials. The United States imports around 66% of its tech goods from China, which caused significant concern when tariffs were first announced and subsequently raised on Chinese imports. We recently reported expectations that consoles, monitors, and laptops would be among the most impacted. Many tariffs initially imposed on April 5th will be reduced for 90 days, but tariffs on China have continued to increase . This exemption list is the first we've seen concerning the tariff situation with China. That said, tariffs will remain in place for all other imports not included in the exemption list. The situation is subject to change, but we'll report any significant updates on the tariff situation as things progress, so be sure to check back regularly for more information.

Reply Are you sure that it includes PC components , not just fully-assembled PCs? Also, I expect cases, heatsinks, and radiators are still be affected by the 25% steel & aluminum tariffs, which did not get suspended. Lastly, the \"de minimis\" exemption on small (sub-$800) packages ends May 2nd. That will hit anything shipped directly from abroad (AliExpress, Temu, some sellers on Amazon & ebay, etc.). I'm not sure exactly how that's going to work, but I think you'll be assessed a customs fee that you pay in order to pick up or receive your package. But, it's the recipient who pays. So, don't expect it to be incorporated into sellers' prices. Reply \"The complete list is available in the official bulletin\" No it's not.

Sure it is, but you have to look up what all those headings/sub correspond to here: https://hts.usitc.gov/ Reply sadly, the only groups that will benefit from these exemptions will be the big businesses. they wont reduce their prices, theyll simply pocket the price difference, while consumers continue to pay inflated prices Reply This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Reply thestryker said: https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8542 So, what's that column labelled \"2\", which says 35% ? Reply bigdragon said: This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . Yeah, I can imagine more and more exemptions getting created, as that 145% rate on Chinese imports begins to bite and retailers & consumers start to recoil at the prices of things. As for tech products, recall that the same thing happened last time around. There was initial panic about motherboards & graphics cards getting hit, but then they were exempted for a time period that kept getting extended. bigdragon said: I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I think the objective hasn't really changed. The strategy is what's now in doubt. bigdragon said: I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Well, yes but I'm sure their case played well, with AI being seen as a strategic priority. Also, it's not just tech executives...

Business Smartphones and computers are now spared from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Updated April 12, 2025 2:02 PM ET Originally published April 12, 2025 12:58 PM ET Juliana Kim Versions of the new Apple iPhone 16 are displayed at an Apple store in in Manhattan Beach, Calif., on April 8. Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images The Trump administration has amended its list of imports that will be affected by sweeping global tariffs in order to exempt certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Politics China put steep tariffs on U.S. exports. Farmers are worried The updated guidance was published Friday night by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The exemption will apply to President Trump's steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed across dozens of countries, which have since been paused until early July as well as the 145% levies currently in place on China. That was the only country excluded from the reciprocal tariff pause. The exemption is effective for products that entered the U.S. or left warehouses starting on April 5. The White House issued a presidential memo about the exemption on Saturday. Sponsor Message When asked about the reasoning behind the exemption, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" Leavitt added, \"At the direction of the President,\" companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" The electronics exemption is a major development in the tariff war with China, which has imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. goods . Prices for electronics from China, a key sector, had been expected to spike . Politics Where do tariffs stand? A look at what's in place and what's on pause Among the items that will now be spared from Trump's steep tariffs include smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and flat panel display modules. But the updated guidance did not address any changes to the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's involvement in the fentanyl trade. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission , China has long been America's chief source for electronic products, with Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia rounding out the top five. There was also concern for American tech giants that rely on supply chains in China, like Apple. Before the updated guidance, Apple was expected to experience major setbacks as a result of the tariffs, Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC earlier this week.
