The drop exceeded even some pessimistic Wall Street analysts\u2019 predictions. By late afternoon, before CEO Elon Musk and other company leaders appeared for a quarterly update call for investors, stock prices appeared relatively stable on the news. Overall, however, the electric automaker\u2019s stock price is down more than 40 percent from its late-2024 high. In a slide deck prepared for investors , Tesla pinned the drop on declines in deliveries, some which it said were related to the need to retool some of its production lines for modified versions of its best-selling electric cars. Unmentioned explicitly in the document were the controversies surrounding Musk and his involvement with the government of President Donald Trump . Musk, who has been called the \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d and regularly spends weekends with Trump in Florida, heads up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency , which is responsible for sweeping federal budget cuts that have affected everything from the data privacy of immigrants and groundbreaking disease research to federal disaster response and consumer financial protections . Musk\u2019s involvement has led to a boycott of Tesla\u2019s cars and mass protests across the US and Europe. On a call with investors, Musk suggested, without evidence, that the protesters had nefarious motives. \u201cThe protests\u2014they\u2019re very organized, they\u2019re paid for, they\u2019re obviously not going to admit that the reason they\u2019re protesting is that they receive fraudulent money and are the recipients of wasteful largesse. But that is the real reason for the protests,\u201d he said. Musk said he would spend less time on DOGE starting in May, though he will continue to dedicate \u201ca day or two per week\u201d to the effort through the end of Trump\u2019s term. Overall, the company\u2019s revenue was down 9 percent compared to last year. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,\u201d Musk told investors, arguing the company has been in worse spots in the past. \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year.\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk, on a call with investors today The numbers put extra pressure on Tesla\u2019s forthcoming self-driving service , set to launch in Austin, Texas, in June, and the Cybercab, a purpose-built robotaxi . Musk said on Tuesday that both are on track. \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,\u201d he told investors on the earnings call. (Musk last promised that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020 .) He said Tesla would have 10 million autonomous vehicles on roads in \u201ca few years.\u201d Beyond taxi services and Cybercab, Musk said Tesla owners in \u201cseveral cities\u201d should this year be able to operate their cars completely autonomously, so that \u201cyou go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination.\u201d He emphasized, though, that Tesla would focus on safety. Musk has argued that Tesla\u2019s future is pinned on its success in self-driving and autonomous technology, which includes not only self-driving cars but also the company\u2019s humanoid robot, Optimus. \u201cThe value of the company is primarily on the basis of autonomy. That's really, I think, the main driver of our value,\" Musk said in 2023. (He has expressed similar sentiments many times since.) Earlier this year, Musk told investors that Tesla would launch autonomous driving technology in Austin and California this year, with a robotaxi service launching in the Texas city in June. (The service is slated to launch with Model Y\u2019s rather than Cybercabs.) Tesla has since obtained a permit to operate a driver-ed taxi service in California , though will need to apply for and win several more permits to operate that service without drivers behind the wheel. It has entered talks with the city of Palo Alto, where its engineering teams are headquartered, to eventually offer a ride service there, according to emails obtained via public records requested by WIRED. (Because of Texas\u2019 less stringent regulations, the carmaker does not need extra permits or government sign-off to operate a driverless service in Austin.) The success of Cybercab, which is set to go into production in 2026, is especially important because Tesla does not seem to have many other car projects on the horizon. A long-awaited, more affordable electric vehicle was downgraded last year to a modified but still cheaper version of Tesla\u2019s popular Model Y rather than a whole new vehicle. Last week, Reuters reported that the more affordable vehicle had been delayed by at least several months . A robotaxi service puts Tesla into direct competition with Google sister company Waymo , which has been operating a paid, self-driving taxi service in metro Phoenix and in San Francisco for nearly two years. (Waymo also operates in Los Angeles and Austin and is set to launch in Atlanta and Miami in the coming months.) Amazon\u2019s Zoox is also preparing to launch service in Las Vegas and, later, San Francisco. Both Waymo and Zoox took more measured approaches to self-driving than Tesla, with years of testing with supervising drivers behind the wheel to monitor the technology. Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature is available on all of its US cars for an added fee, but the company warns that drivers must still pay attention to the road while using its tech. Still, the company has emphasized that it will leap from this less advanced, \u201clevel 2\u201d autonomy to full-blown unsupervised driving. Technology experts have cast doubt on Tesla\u2019s ambitious timelines. Self-driving watchers should be mindful of the high levels of safety and reliability demanded by an autonomous vehicle service, says Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT who leads the Advanced Vehicle Technology consortium, which brings together industry experts and academics to study how people interact with automated driving features. \u201dI think the world is wondering, can Tesla do this?\u201d says Reimer. \u201cAnd my answer is, yeah, they can do some demo, probably with a safety driver.\u201d A Tesla robotaxi service will also need much work beyond even the complex technology required to make the cars go. \u201cUntil you actually pull the safety driver out, you don\u2019t realize all the other things they were doing for you: answering questions for the passenger, helping them navigate the whole system, [navigating] the picking up and dropping off,\u201d says Jeff Schneider, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who once worked for Uber\u2019s self-driving-car project. In a slide deck for investors, Tesla wrote that it expected to be affected by uncertainty related to \u201cevolving trade policy,\u201d which the company says will likely affect both Tesla\u2019s global supply chain and what it spends to build its products. \u201cThis dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\u201d the deck said. Musk told investors that Tesla was still the \u201cleast impacted\u201d car company in terms of tariffs , because so much of the company\u2019s vehicle stock is made and assembled in the US. \u201cThat puts us in a better position than many of our competitors,\u201d he said. Musk said he would continue to speak with the president about tariff policy. \u201cI will continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,\u201d he said.

And in the earnings report, the company has issued what seems to be an admission that its own CEO\u2019s actions are to blame. It\u2019s been a rough time for Tesla employees lately. The company\u2019s mission is an admirable one: to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable transportation. Many employees joined the company with that mission in mind, wanting to do something positive for the world. But in recent times, the highest-profile employee of the company, its CEO and largest individual shareholder Elon Musk, has moved away from that mission . He spent huge sums from his personal wealth to campaign for an anti-EV political candidate , and is now actively participating in politics as an ally to those anti-EV forces and spreading climate misinformation along the way. He\u2019s also famously vindictive and Tesla\u2019s board refuses to rein him in as he works to destroy the company . Advertisement - scroll for more content So what is a Tesla employee to do, in this case? On the one hand, they want to do what\u2019s right for the company. On the other hand, they don\u2019t want to attract the ire of their boss who wants to do what\u2019s wrong for the company. When your livelihood is at stake, sometimes you\u2019ll choose to just keep your head down, keep working the best you can, and hope in vain that at some point the CEO might change his mind and stop acting like an idiot, or the board might finally step in for the good of the company. (Or, alternately, if you have other options, you might quit to make a statement , like many executives have ) However, we\u2019ve seen some instances of some Tesla employees trying to do something, anything , to cry out to the world that all of this isn\u2019t normal. And one example of that comes from Tesla\u2019s earnings report today. Tesla says tariffs will harm it It\u2019s right there in the third paragraph of the summary at the beginning of the document: Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This sort of statement is not a surprise to see in a quarterly report in the environment we\u2019re currently in. The US stock market and economy as a whole are showing increasingly worrying signs, almost entirely due to the flailing actions of the ignoramuses who somehow find themselves in the Oval Office (despite that there exists a clear legal remedy stopping insurrectionists from holding office in the US). These actions have included the announcement of several tariffs (even though that is the purview of Congress), seemingly determined randomly through a dumb formula that didn\u2019t even use the right numbers , and which seem to change every day (as one would expect when the person implementing them is senile and was profoundly stupid even before he went senile). This idiotic flailing has produced the expected response: retaliatory tariffs, distrust from the international community, less availability of goods domestically, chaos among the business community, and pushing nations we consider as our rivals closer to the rest of the world . Businesses, on the whole, have tried to stick to factual statements in their earnings reports and business forecasts. But despite that these statements are generally dry, the message remains clear: tariffs will increase costs for everyone and make business more difficult . And Tesla\u2019s statement is similarly dry, pointing to the uncertainty of ever-changing tariff decisions and how they will affect supply chains and cost. This is especially true for Tesla Energy, which will be affected much more than its car business , as Tesla also acknowledged today, stating \u201cthe current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.\u201d But for Tesla, this is still exceptional given that the company\u2019s moonlighting CEO, who spends little time working on Tesla business and is otherwise occupied with his twitter addiction , stealing Tesla resources for his private AI company , and trying to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency . Along with all this, Musk is also an advisor in the very administration that is making Tesla\u2019s business difficult. Musk has stated his opposition to tariffs , but he himself has to walk a thin line and occasionally downplay his language , given his self-professed \u201clove\u201d for Mr. Trump. And, despite this supposed opposition, he still remains one of the largest financial backers of the tariff advocate in question. But Musk\u2019s politics are also harming the company But tariffs aren\u2019t the only thing that will make Tesla\u2019s business difficult, as Tesla acknowledged today in its letter. It continued to say: This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term. Again, a rather dry statement elucidating a very significant problem with the company at the moment. It\u2019s not so much that political sentiment about EVs is changing, as EV sales continue to grow globally , despite headlines falsely suggesting otherwise . It\u2019s sentiment against Tesla that is changing, largely due to Musk\u2019s involvement in politics. The main driver of Tesla\u2019s recent sales decline has been Musk\u2019s high-profile political advocacy, which has included support for German neo-Nazis and agreeing with a defense of Hitler\u2019s actions in the Holocaust , among many other white supremacist statements . This has driven protests against the company , embarrassed owners and pushed many customers away . It shouldn\u2019t have to be said that allying a company\u2019s brand with neo-Nazis is a bad political decision, especially so if you, as an individual, are so tied to the brand. In fact, this is something that Tesla acknowledged very early in its existence, as the company used to make a very intentional effort not to make EVs political, hoping to be able to sell to as broad of an audience as possible. Musk seems to have forgotten that directive sometime during his ongoing twitter addiction (an addiction so bad that he has now overpaid for the company not once, but twice ). This isn\u2019t the first time Tesla has had to do this But this isn\u2019t the first time Tesla has had to call out its own CEO\u2019s actions. As the Musk problem has continued to get worse, Tesla has said similar things multiple times in recent months. In March, Tesla\u2019s policy team sent a letter to the US Trade Representative urging the USTR to \u201cconsider the downstream impacts\u201d of proposed actions. One of those downstream impacts includes retaliatory tariffs, and given the high profile nature of the attachment between Tesla\u2019s CEO and another social media addicted clown who\u2019s implementing said tariffs, there was a lot of talk about Tesla becoming target of those tariffs. Top comment by Kojak Liked by 25 people He can try to blame things like the tariffs - but fundamentally - Musk made bad business decisions from the Cybertruck design to the Robotaxi instead of a low cost EV. He has consistently gone against staff recommendations that were based upon a business case analysis. It's time for him to go. View all comments And sure enough, Tesla has seen other governments retaliate against it. Canada has removed Tesla from some incentive programs and is investigating Tesla\u2019s sudden incentive cash grab . The UK, one of the few territories where Tesla sales are not down , has also considered removing the company from incentive programs . Tesla has also had to walk a thin line on EV incentives, stating that it supports killing EV incentives in the US because Musk said so (even though that would harm the company ), while still lobbying for EV incentives overseas where the Musk/Trump stink isn\u2019t overpowering the conversation. So, in the end, it seems like a really tough time to be a Tesla employee. The company knows that its CEO is harming it, but the board won\u2019t do anything about it, and speaking up too forcefully can get you fired .

It said it would have to reassess its growth forecast in three months. The electric-vehicle maker said in its first-quarter results that it would revisit its annual outlook in its next earnings report due to \"the impacts of shifting global trade policy \". It said its plans to release a cheaper car in the first half of 2025, and launch a robo taxi fleet in Austin, Texas, both remained on track.

Many investors are calling for Musk to leave his work as US President Donald Trump's adviser and get back to managing Tesla more closely. Tesla showrooms have been vandalised, and sales in California - its largest US market - have fallen sharply. Related: Commentary: Elon Musk is torching America on behalf of Donald Trump But its stronger-than-expected margin in the first quarter offers some relief, as its cost of making and selling vehicles dropped over 17 per cent year over year, driven by lower raw material prices and reduced expenses of ramping up Cybertruck production. Automotive gross margin for the period, excluding regulatory credits, was 12.5 per cent, according to Reuters calculations, compared with expectations of 11.8 per cent, according to 21 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. But the company said: \"Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\" Related: Musk made direct appeals to Trump to reverse new tariffs, Washington Post reports It added that it was \"difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,\" which would prompt a reevaluation of its annual forecast. The electric vehicle maker reported revenue of US$19.34 billion for the January-March quarter, compared with estimates of US$21.11 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Tesla reported earlier this month that deliveries in the January-March period slid 13 per cent, as the company lost ground to Chinese rivals, and Musk's political actions as a close adviser to US President Donald Trump have damaged the brand. Related: Trump talks up Tesla in White House show of support for Musk The company's stock, which closed at US$237.97 on Tuesday, has nearly halved from its December peak. It was little changed in after-market trading. The EV maker scrapped plans for a brand-new, low-cost model last year, opting instead to produce cheaper variants using existing platforms and assembly lines. Reuters reported exclusively on Friday that Tesla delayed plans to start production of a more affordable Model Y crossover by at least a few months. Musk promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in Texas by June, and in California for later this year. To that end, Tesla has been seeking regulatory approvals, but there are serious concerns about safety and related litigation risks that could come with deploying unproven driverless technology on public streets. Related: Musk says he hopes for 'zero tariffs' between US and Europe Analysts expect a second straight annual decline in Tesla deliveries in 2025, despite efforts to boost sales through incentives like free charging and Full Self-Driving features. Tesla also recalled all Cybertrucks delivered since late 2023 and launched a lower-priced $70,000 version of the vehicle. It has been discounting unsold inventory of the electric pickup truck in recent weeks. Tariff tensions add further uncertainty. Tesla has paused some China-sourced component imports after U.S. tariffs on the Asian country rose to 145%, Reuters reported. China has responded with tariffs of its own, leading Tesla to suspend new Model S and X orders in the country.

FX has released a new teaser trailer and poster for Noah Hawley \u2019s Alien series Alien: Earth , in celebration of Earth Day. It sounds like the teaser is narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson. IGN has also launched a \u201cAlien: Earth\u201d World Guide , which is an interactive campaign for the series that \u201cprovides fans of the acclaimed sci-fi horror franchise an exclusive look at the FX-Hulu series coming this summer.\u201d The campaign will into this year\u2019s Alien Day on Saturday, April 26, and it is a place set up for fans to find exclusive info and teasers for Alien: Earth , including a video series \u201cchronicling the gestation of a Xenomorph.\u201d The first of those videos is already available today. In the series: \"When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman ( Sydney Chandler ) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. \u201cAs members of the crash recovery crew search for survivors among the wreckage, they encounter mysterious predatory life forms more terrifying than they could have ever imagined. \u201cWith this new threat unlocked, the search crew must fight for survival and what they choose to do with this discovery could change planet Earth as they know it.\u201d The story is set three decades before the events of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic Alien and a few years before Prometheus . The series will find the characters \"caught in a conflict with the beginning of artificial intelligence and the competition among developers and users.\" Hawley previously said of the story: \"It's set on Earth of the future. At this moment, I describe that as Edison versus Westinghouse versus Tesla. Someone's going to monopolize electricity. We just don't know which one it is.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn the movies, we have this Weyland-Yutani Corporation, which is clearly also developing artificial intelligence-but what if there are other companies trying to look at immortality in a different way, with cyborg enhancements or transhuman downloads? Which of those technologies is going to win?\" This series will blend \u201cboth the timeless horror of the first Alien film with the non-stop action of the second, it\u2019s going to be a scary thrill ride that will blow people back in their seats.\u201c Hawley also said: \u201cThere\u2019s something about seeing a Xenomorph in the wilds of Earth with your own eyes. That is truly chilling to think of it moving here among us, and so I can\u2019t tell you under what circumstances you\u2019ll see that, but you\u2019ll see it \u2014 and you\u2019re going to lock your door that night.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat was really fun for me was to really engage with the creature, bring some of my own thoughts to the design while not touching the silhouette, because that\u2019s sacrosanct. \u201cBut some of the elements as we know, whatever the host is, informs what the final creature is. I just wanted to play around a little bit to make it as scary as it should be.\u201d The show also stars Alex Lawther ( The End of the F*cking World ) as the male lead, a soldier named CJ, with Samuel Blenkin ( Black Mirror ) as another main character named Boy Kavalier, a CEO. Additional cast members include Essie Davis ( Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries ) as Dame Silvia, and Adarsh Gourav ( The White Tiger ) as Slightly. Alien: Earth will be released in 2025.

The All Ordinaries was much the same, ending the day +1.4% at 8125. Gold stocks fell from a record high as the price of the precious metal plunged. All sectors except basic materials and academic & educational services made gains. That's all from the ABC markets blog for today. But my colleague Stephanie Chalmers will be back bright and early tomorrow to bring you the latest. 'til then, Loading 15h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 6:18am Treasurer 'wins' debate, but doesn't convince the room D By Daniel Ziffer If we must score the Treasurer versus Shadow Treasurer debate, then J im Chalmers 'won' the even t. His answers were clearer, and his proposals more directly linked to answering the problems raised . Angus Taylor didn't or couldn't answer how the Coalition will pay for expensive promises, and what cuts or changes can be expected. But the result probably didn't change a lot of votes in the room. It was filled with representatives of small businesses (via their key lobby group) and mega-businesses like Rio Tinto (via theirs). On issues like company tax, industrial relations changes and wage costs the Labor answer might have been clear - even pointing forward to policies that will be enacted if they win - but not one that will lower the burden of costs of the people in the room. 15h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 6:13am Why gold's rise may not be over N By Nadia Daly More comments here on the gold situation we outlined earlier. Commonwealth Bank's Vivek Dhar : \"After rising as high as $US3,485/oz in intra day trading yesterday, gold futures have pulled back this morning to under $US3,400/oz. The pullback was triggered by comments from President Trump that the final US tariff on China would not be \u201canywhere near\u201d the 145% level that has currently been set. The comments, which brightened the outlook on US trade policy, was an ideal time for profit taking for gold investors, especially given the 18% rally in gold futures from 7 April to the intra day peak yesterday.\" He continues: \"The reduced appeal of US safe haven assets has renewed interest in shifting away from the US dollar as the world\u2019s pre eminent reserve currency (i.e. de dollarisation). While the interest in de dollarisation has certainly been beneficial to gold futures, it is hard to see how a material move away from the US dollar can practically take place. The primary issue is finding an alternative to the US dollar as the main reserve currency. The Euro suffers from a lack of fiscal union, which has meant a fragmented capital and bond market. Gold has also been floated a potential option, especially given the increase in central bank buying since the beginning of 2022. Central bank buying of gold surged after the US led its allies to freeze Russia\u2019s currency reserves in response to the Ukraine war. Countries realised that gold was a potential hedge against the US freezing currency reserves for non alignment with US policy. Given worries of non alignment with the US have only increased under President Trump, the prospect of more central bank buying is high. It is unlikely though that the US dollar is at any threat of replacement by gold given the costs to transport, warehouse and secure gold and the lack of returns generated by holding gold. Even though gold prices and central bank gold purchases have shown virtually no correlation in the last two years to the end of 2024, the anticipation of more central bank buying, combined with extraordinary safe haven demand, may see gold rise to $US3,750/oz by year end.\" 15h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 6:00am Unlikely food boom blamed on TikTok N By Nadia Daly As a foodie I can understand many weird food trends and long lines outside restaurants made famous by TikTok, but this one stumped me. Apparently one extremely boring (sorry) food item is flying off the shelves and is in low supply in supermarkets thanks to a trend on TikTok. The product in question? Cottage cheese Read on: Cottage cheese in short supply as TikTok trend drives popularity Key Event 15h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 5:45am Gold continues to fall from record highs N By Nadia Daly The price of spot gold is falling further today - currently down over 1% to US$3344 - and gold miners are being impacted too. The decline follows weeks of gold scaling new record highs, as uncertainty draws investors to the safe haven asset. Many of the companies at the bottom of the ASX200 this afternoon are gold miners, including Ramelius Resources (-14.5% at 3:45pm AEST), Spartan Resources (-13%) and Vault Minerals (-11.6%). 16h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 5:16am Carmaker in court over 'rusty' cars N By Nadia Daly The consumer watchdog has taken a car manufacturer to court for allegedly misleading advertising. The ACCC alleges Ateco Automotive Pty Ltd, trading as LDV Automotive Australia allegedly made misleading representations to consumers about the durability and suitability of particular models of LDV branded vehicles in breach of the Australian Consumer Law. The ACCC alleges that those vehicles had a propensity to rust or corrode within five years of being manufactured. The Federal Court action concerns models with T60 and G10 in their names (excluding the eT60). The ACCC says between approximately 23 April 2019 and 30 November 2024, LDV made misleading representations to consumers that the cars were durable and tough, and that they were suitable for use in, near, or on, a variety of environments and off-road terrains. But the consumer watchdog alleges those cars had a propensity to develop rust or corrosion within the first five years from the date of manufacture, and were therefore not durable and tough. ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said: \u201cWe allege that despite being aware of the propensity for the vehicles to rust, LDV continued to make representations for a number of years that the T60 and G10 vehicles were durable and suitable for use in a variety of terrains,\u201d \u201cAs a result, we allege that LDV\u2019s conduct is likely to have caused harm to affected consumers, including because the propensity for rust or corrosion lowered the value of their vehicles, and because consumers lost the opportunity to make an informed decision that may have involved purchasing an alternative vehicle that did not carry the same risks.\u201d Key Event 16h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 5:01am Treasurer candidates spar on costings, tax cuts S By Stephanie Chalmers We'll bring you a vibe check from Daniel Ziffer who was in the room shortly, but the big points of contention from the debate between Angus Taylor and Jim Chalmers seemed to be: Cuts and costings \u2014 Chalmers and moderator Laura Jayes pressed \u2014 Chalmers aggressively so \u2014 Taylor on what the Coalition will cut and the costing details of its policies. Taylor pointed to savings from using existing coal fired power for its nuclear plan and by relying on the private sector to boost housing supply. But no cuts were detailed. A business tax cut? Angus Taylor also seemed to allude to a cut to the company tax rate but when pressed did not confirm. He initially said wait until costings are released next week, and then cited measures like the instant asset write-off as equating to a tax cut for small business. So no official company tax cut announcement there. 16h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:57am Small businesses spending 15 hours a week on paperwork S By Stephanie Chalmers A fun (or... not so fun) fact from Luke Achterstraat, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (COSBOA). As he thanks the small business owners in attendance at the debate for asking questions of the treasurer and shadow treasurer, he notes their time is particularly valuable as small businesses are spending 15 hours a week on paperwork. Ouch. 16h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:54am Taylor harks back to a better time T By Tony Ibrahim Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor is also citing the global instability as a reason for the Coalition to be voted into power. Mr Taylor attacked the Labor government's track record over its last three years in power, claiming household, business and government budgets are worse off. He says the Liberal's platform starts with beating back inflation - a task already underway, and investing in businesses to help boost the economy's growth. He concluded by mentioning his personal experience advising businesses before entering politics. \"We can get this contry back on track,\" he said. Key Event 16h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:41am Treasurer goes on the attack on costings S By Stephanie Chalmers Jim Chalmers' final minute and he uses it to go on the attack against Angus Taylor. \"He can't even tell us how much his nuclear reactors will cost or what he will cut to pay for them. \"He can't tell us what his policies will cost or what he will cut to pay for them. \"He can't tell us what that means for Medicare or pensions or payments or housing and skills. They've just stumbled from one shambles to another\u2026 \"In these uncertain times for the global economy, we offer stability and responsibility and the opposition offer only risk... \"Now is the worst time to take a risk.\" 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:35am Cutting red tape when it comes to employing casual workers T By Tony Ibrahim A small business owner has asked if either party will commit to cutting red tape, particularly when it comes to industrial relations laws. Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor says the current laws are too difficult for small businesses to easily interpret, repeating a line that small businesses don't have a legal department. He claims regulation will be rolled back if the Liberal National Coalition is elected into power. Treasurer Jim Chalmers addressed the question by talking about how Labor is cutting red tape across different parts of government, such as the planning approval process for housing. He then invoked a mix of policies that help attract and retain workers, such as the modest tax cut and early childhood support. 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:35am How can business harness AI? S By Stephanie Chalmers A question on how Australian businesses can harness the power of artificial intelligence. The treasurer calls it a \"huge opportunity\". \"So much of the change in our economy is exciting and it's driven by technological disruption.\" The shadow treasurer agrees it's an important opportunity. 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:27am What will both parties do on productivity growth? S By Stephanie Chalmers Taking you back a few minutes, to a question about the approaches to productivity growth, from economist Alex Joiner. Jim Chalmers referenced investment in skills and efforts to streamline regulations. \"A lot of this has been about making our economy more dynamic, competitive and productive.\" Angus Taylor says the Coalition will streamline approvals by establishing 'Investment Australia' to approve major products and again refers to stopping overreach by regulators. 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:25am Taylor on industrial relations D By Daniel Ziffer Angus Taylor has previously said he doesn't support penalty rate changes. \"We do need to restore commonsense, particularly for small businesses where it has been lost,\" he says. He calls for the CFMEU to be de-registered, and the ABCC to be reestablished. \"They hold every Australian taxpayer to ransom. \"You need a legal department in small business to work (through) Labor's changes\u2026 we don't have a plan to change (multi-employer bargaining).\" 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:21am Rio Tinto Australian boss asks about industrial relations D By Daniel Ziffer Kellie Parker, the Australian CEO of Rio Tinto, asks about the \"costs and disruption\" of IR law and what metrics they'll use to measure that. Chalmers says if honoured to get a second term the priorities are gender equality, the review of modern awards and non-compete clauses. \"We believe in penalty rates,\" the treasurer says. 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:17am Labor and Liberals on the Instant asset write-off T By Tony Ibrahim Treasurer Jim Chalmers says Labor will extend the instant asset write-off to $20,000. This would allow businesses to claim an immediate deducation for the business portion of the cost of an asset in the year it's first used or installed ready for use. But Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor says the Liberals will lift the asset write-off to $30,000 - and will make it permanent to give, as he claims, small businesses certainty. Key Event 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:14am Will taxes be cut for businesses? S By Stephanie Chalmers Jim Chalmers and Angus Taylor are asked to give a guarantee that there will not be new taxes or levies on businesses. \"We've already made it very clear that the [Petroleum Resource Rent Tax] changes, the multinational tax changes, they're on our agenda,\" the treasurer says. \"When it comes to business taxes, we're cutting taxes for 1.5 million small businesses and Angus wants to increase taxes on all of those people.\" Angus Taylor says: \"Our plan is to reduce taxes for businesses like yours in this room,\" referring to the gathering of big and small business groups and lobbyists. The moderator interjects and asks if the Coalition will cut the company tax rate. \"We have already when we were in government cut company tax.\" He's asked to clarify/confirm, but then starts talking about the Instant asset write-off and other measures, saying \"they are tax cuts for small business\". 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:14am Tax bracket creep, corporate tax and asset write-offs T By Tony Ibrahim A question has been asked on whether either Chalmers or Taylor will commit to reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 per cent, making instant asset write-offs permanent and indexing personal tax rates to eliminate bracket creep. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has started by focusing on bracket creep, claiming a policy legislated last week has returned bracket creep to help 14 million taxpayers. He claims it's an important distinction between the two parties, but hasn't progressed to the corporate tax rate or instant asset write off baked into the question. 17h ago Wed 23 Apr 2025 at 4:05am The talking over begins D By Daniel ZIffer First burn of the day, after Angus Taylor declines to outline in more detail what the Coalition would cut to rein in spending and pay for big budget promises. \"Growth is the key?\" Chalmers exclaims in response to Taylor's answer, calling it a slogan not a policy. \"It's like a Year 9 economics assignment.\" They then go on to talk over each other.

Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs. But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla. His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world. Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month. But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely. Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him\". Who is Elon Musk? Published 12 hours ago What is Doge and why is Musk cutting so many jobs? Published 7 hours ago Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk Published 20 March The tech boss said he would now \"be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work \"critical\" and pledging to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\". On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand. Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would \"try to attack me and the Doge team\". Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company. \"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said. Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro. On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\". \"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.

Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs. But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla. His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world. Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month. But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely. Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him\". Who is Elon Musk? What is Doge and why is Musk cutting so many jobs? Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk The tech boss said he would now \"be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work \"critical\" and pledging to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\". On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand. Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would \"try to attack me and the Doge team\". Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company. \"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said. Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro. On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\". \"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said. 'Problems mounting' Earlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\".

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com PUBLISHED: April 22, 2025 at 5:26 PM EDT NEW YORK \u2014 Tesla\u2019s first-quarter profits plunged by more than two-thirds amid a backlash against Elon Musk\u2019s electric car company that has hurt sales and sent its stock plunging. The Austin, Texas, company said Tuesday that quarterly profits fell by 70% to to $409 million, or 12 cents a share. That\u2019s far below analyst estimates. Tesla\u2019s revenue fell 9% to $19.3 billion in the January through March period, also below Wall Street\u2019s forecast. The disappointing results come as the company struggles to sell cars to consumers angry over Musk\u2019s leadership of a federal government jobs-cutting group that has divided the country and sparked protests. Musk also has publicly supported far-right politicians in Europe and alienated potential buyers there, too. Many investors have also complained Musk is too distracted with his Trump administration role to be running Tesla and that he should either relinquish his position as CEO or abandon his advisory role in Washington. Tesla\u2019 stock has fallen more than 40% this year but rose slightly in after-hours trading. Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said earlier reports of plunging sales that had tanked the stock made the results almost predictable. \u201cThey\u2019re not particularly surprising given that deliveries were down,\u201d Goldstein said, adding that the company is still generating cash. \u201cIt was good to see positive cash flow.\u201d The company generated $2.2 billion in operating cash versus $242 million a year earlier.

Tesla's first-quarter revenue was $19.34 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. Tesla (TSLA) still holds almost $1 billion in bitcoin, according to the automaker's latest earnings report . The electric vehicle firm reported digital asset holdings worth $951 million as of March 31, down from $1.076 billion on Dec. 30. Tesla currently holds 11,509 bitcoin in its balance sheet, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

The change is almost certainly due to bitcoin's price depreciating between the two quarters. Data from Arkham Intelligence indicates that Tesla did not perform any transactions in the last three months. Arkham marks Tesla's holdings as being currently worth $1.049 billion. A new rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires corporate holders of digital assets to begin marking those assets to market each quarter. Tesla also reported $19.34 billion in revenue for the first quarter of the year; analysts had expected the carmaker to rake in $21.37 billion. The TSLA shares were up more than 2% in after-hours trading. Tesla Bitcoin Elon Musk Tom Carreras Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

Are BTC futures traders drinking the same Kool-Aid? 8612 Total views 15 Total shares Listen to article 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to a 45-day high above $91,000 on April 22, and the upward movement coincided with gold reaching a new all-time high. The price gains reflect investors' concerns over a potential economic recession amid ongoing global trade tensions. The tides are shifting, but does data support a Bitcoin price rally above $95,000? Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch In neutral markets, the Bitcoin futures premium typically ranges between 5% and 10% to compensate for the longer settlement period. At present, the annualized premium stands at 6%, which is not considered particularly bullish, even though BTC appreciated by $6,840 between April 20 and April 22. Some analysts interpret this as a sign that Bitcoin is beginning to decouple from the stock market. Traders\u2019 PTSD could emerge around BTC\u2019s $90K zone Part of this skepticism among traders stems from Bitcoin\u2019s repeated inability to sustain levels above $90,000 in early March. For example, Bitcoin tested the $95,000 mark on March 3, only to fall to $81,464 the following day. This inconsistent performance since the $109,346 peak on Jan. 20 has contributed to a lack of conviction among bullish investors, especially as gold has continued to set new all-time highs during the same period. S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Currently, Bitcoin is trading 16% below its all-time high, a figure that closely mirrors the S&P 500\u2019s decline of 14.5%. This suggests that the recent era of excessive risk-taking may be behind us. Notably, even at its lowest point below $75,000, Bitcoin\u2019s 32% drawdown was less severe than those experienced by Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (META), and Tesla (TSLA). Comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 22 contributed to easing investor concerns. As reported by Bloomberg, Bessent described the ongoing tariff standoff with China as \u201cunsustainable,\u201d suggesting an increased likelihood of de-escalation. In contrast, US President Donald Trump took to social media to assert that US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is hindering economic growth by not reducing interest rates. Bitcoin\u2019s gains contrast with investors\u2019 shift to government bonds Regardless of where the blame lies for the subdued economic growth in the United States, demand for short-term US Treasurys has risen, as evidenced by the yield on the 2-year note declining to 3.81% from 4.04% a month earlier. Essentially, investors are accepting lower returns in exchange for the perceived safety of government bonds. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin\u2019s 6.3% price increase over the past 30 days stands out as particularly notable. To determine whether these recent gains have affected professional traders\u2019 sentiment, it is important to examine the BTC options markets. If traders expect a correction, put (sell) options tend to trade at a premium, causing the 25% delta skew metric to rise above 6%. Conversely, bullish sentiment pushes the indicator below -6%. Bitcoin 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the Bitcoin options market reflects limited enthusiasm following the recent surge to $91,000, with the 25% delta skew indicator at -2%, which remains within the neutral range. According to this metric, the last period of bullish sentiment occurred on Jan. 30, when Bitcoin traded near $105,000. Therefore, there is no clear evidence that large investors or market makers are anticipating a sustained rally above $95,000. Related: Institutional demand could push BTC past $200k in 2025 \u2014 Analysts Despite some weak macroeconomic data, market participants expect a relatively strong first-quarter earnings season. FactSet reports that the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d companies are projected to achieve earnings growth of 14.8% for the first quarter compared to the prior year. While Bitcoin still has a reasonable chance of revisiting $95,000 or higher, many traders appear to be waiting for further developments in the US-China trade war before placing additional bullish bets.

The company retreated from its guidance issued for 2025, citing uncertainty about trade policy amid US tariffs against the car industry. \u201cUncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cThis dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\u201d Advertisement The backlash to the brand has come about amid Musk playing a key role in US government downsizing as one of Donald Trump\u2019s White House advisers- and creating some uncomfortable moments for Irish owners in the process. Activists have staged nationwide demonstrations against Trump or Musk multiple times since the new administration took power. Protesters are assailing the Trump administration\u2019s moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close Social Security Administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut federal funding for health programs. However, Musk plans to \u201csignificantly\u201d reduce his work for Trump\u2019s administration in May to focus on Tesla, the billionaire CEO said today. \u201cProbably in the next month, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\u201d Musk said on an earnings conference call.

Nearly a month ago, President Donald Trump denied a report that Musk was on his way out \u2014 although it\u2019s since appeared as though he has limited Musk\u2019s access or, as with the unpopular tariffs driving the market down, flat-out ignored Musk\u2019s suggestions. Citing The Washington Post\u2019s Tuesday report about the past few \u201cpunishing\u201d months for Musk\u2019s Tesla brand with a 44% dive in 2025 so far, Maddow said that Tuesday\u2019s upcoming first-quarter report \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be good \u2026 and that may give [Musk] the business excuse he\u2019s been looking for to get out of D.C.\u201d The MSNBC host then recapped all the ways that Musk\u2019s time as head of the Department of Government Efficiency has gone wrong, calling DOGE \u201ca mix of embarrassment for its errors\u201d that has caused \u201cconfusion, horror and anger for the damage it\u2019s done to the U.S. government, with virtually nothing positive to show for it.\u201d Read Next Elon Musk Blasts 'Moron' Peter Navarro Over Tesla Comments She also noted that if DOGE was really about cutting government spending, it has \u201ccompletely failed\u201d since Trump is now spending more than President Joe Biden. \u201cThen there were Musk\u2019s cocky assertions about 150-year-olds receiving Social Security \u2014 which were immediately debunked and showed he just didn\u2019t understand the data. That\u2019s pretty embarrassing for someone whose whole brand is, \u2018Look how smart I am,\u2019\u201d Maddow continued. She further cited Rolling Stone\u2019s report that Musk \u201cappears to be high all the time\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cpossibly the most annoying person on the planet.\u201d Also on the list of failed Musk projects: the spectacularly bad showing of the candidate he endorsed for Wisconsin state Supreme Court race. \u201cHis candidate lost by double-digits. The election was widely seen as a referendum on Elon Musk,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cThen Musk took a loud, public stance against Trump\u2019s tariffs. Trump ignored it. The tariffs remained \u2014 along with their disastrous implications for Musk\u2019s car company.\u201d The pundit also mentioned how the billionaire\u2019s \u201cfive things you did last week\u201d program for government employees is being ignored. \u201cMusk no longer seems to have the juice to do anything about it. He doesn\u2019t appear to be running much of anything, let alone swinging an axe over federal workers,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that, on top of the massive public revulsion at his role in the Trump administration and in American politics, has made the Tesla brand toxic \u2014 not to mention Musk\u2019s own personal brand,\u201d Maddow concluded.

The electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s quarterly earnings plunged by 71% to US$409 million compared with the first quarter of 2024, the company announced on Tuesday (Wednesday NZT), a bruising result that comes amid widespread backlash against CEO Elon Musk and his work with the Trump administration.

Tesla was already struggling before Musk enmeshed himself in GOP politics last year.

Doge stands for the Department of Government Efficiency and is aggressively pursuing an initiative meant to reduce \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d in the federal government. A combination of increased competition from Chinese electric carmakers such as BYD, uncertainty around Trump\u2019s tariffs (around 20% of Tesla\u2019s components are made in Mexico and it buys batteries from BYD in China) and Musk\u2019s declining popularity has pushed the company into turmoil.

Investors and shareholders have become increasingly frustrated with the CEO, as they attribute much of the company\u2019s woes to the upheaval he has caused in the federal government. Sweeping layoffs and dramatic budget cuts mandated by Doge have led to chaos, confusion and backlash.

Elon Musk (L), and Donald Trump. Tesla reported a 71 per cent drop in first-quarter profits Tuesday in results that lagged analyst estimates as Elon Musk's automaker warned of a hit to demand due to \"changing political sentiment\", as per a report The electric vehicle producer reported profits of $409 million, down 71 per cent from the year-ago results. The company retreated from its 2025 guidance, citing uncertainty about trade policy and demand, AFP reported. The Austin, Texas, company said Tuesday that quarterly profits fell by 12 cents a share. That\u2019s far below analyst estimates. Tesla\u2019s revenue fell 9 per cent to $19.3 billion in the January through March period, below Wall Street\u2019s forecast. Tesla's stock has fallen more than 40 per cent this year. Many investors have also complained Musk is too distracted with his Trump administration role to be running Tesla and that he should either relinquish his position as CEO or abandon his advisory role in Washington. Live Events Meanwhile, treasurers of seven U.S. states have raised concerns about Tesla CEO Elon Musk's lack of focus on the electric vehicle maker, given its significance in regional industries, innovation and employment. Tesla deliveries plunged 13 per cent in the first quarter due to backlash against Elon Musk's politics, rising global competition and people waiting for a refresh to its highest-selling electric vehicle Model Y. If Tesla falters, the effects will not be confined to shareholders, but will be felt across regional economies, workforce pipelines and public confidence in the energy transition, California State Controller Malia Cohen and seven state treasurers, including Washington's Mike Pellicciotti and Illinois' Michael Frerichs, said. The treasurers asked the board to clarify how Musk and the Tesla board were ensuring that adequate time and effort was being put into resolving the company's underperformance, and how the board was evaluating whether executive compensation was aligned with shareholder value and corporate accountability.

Minnesota state employee who allegedly caused over $20K in damages to Teslas is let off by woke DA \u2014 as cops slam deal ny post ^ | 04/22/225 | y Patrick Reilly Posted on 04/22/2025 2:03:51 PM PDT by BenLurkin A progressive district attorney has declined to charge the state employee in Tim Walz-led Minnesota who was allegedly caught causing $20,000 damage by vandalizing half a dozen Teslas \u2014 a decision the local police chief ripped as the latest betrayal of victims. The suspected vandal, 33-year-old Minnesota government employee Dylan Bryan Adams, was allegedly spotted keying the vehicles and stripping their paint off while out walking his dog around the city. Despite what police believe to be evidence of Adams committing felonies, Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty will seek diversion rather than criminal charges. Adams was arrested a month after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said watching Tesla\u2019s stock price plummet gave him \u201ca little boost during the day\u201d during a rally in Wisconsin. Adams, who works for Minnesota\u2019s Department of Human Services, is not a political appointee in Walz\u2019s administration, a spokesperson for the governor said last week. He is one of more than 40,000 state employees, the rep added. Moriarty has been Hennepin County\u2019s top prosecutor since January 2023 after handedly winning the nonpartisan DA election, but the former public defender quickly came under fire for her woke policies that allowed accused rapists and killers to stay free.

Just a few months ago, in January, Tesla was confident in predicting that it would return to growth in 2025: \u201cWith the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.\u201d Today, Tesla released its Q1 2025 financial results, confirming that it had its worst quarter in years to start 2025. Advertisement - scroll for more content The automaker is now clearly not as confident about returning to growth in its automotive business this year. Tesla updated its \u201coutlook\u201d section this quarter to highlight the potential impact of trade policies and now no longer discusses automotive growth in isolation. Instead, it bundled automotive and energy businesses together and said that it will \u201crevisit its 2025 guidance\u201d next quarter: It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment. We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update. Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries are already down about 50,000 units so far this year compared to last year. It will be challenging to catch up in the current macroeconomic situation. Tesla again guided the start of production of \u201cnew affordable models\u201d in the first half of 2025, which could help the automaker to deliver more cars. However, as we have previously reported, these new vehicles are expected to be stripped-down Model Y and Model 3 , which will cannibalize Tesla\u2019s current sales and limit its growth to those products. Electrek\u2019s Take Tesla appears to be somewhat shaken following a challenging quarter. The company would have literally lost money if it hadn\u2019t boosted its regulatory credit sales. Top comment by Michael Wolf Liked by 14 people I think it's very telling that the Tesla promo image shows theoretical future products like Optimus in the lineup, but no sight of the Roadster. If I had put money down on that vehicle, I be demanding the money back. View all comments Tesla started the year down 50,000 units; it already doesn\u2019t have a backlog for the new Model Y, and now we need to expect growth later this year, thanks to a stripped-down Model Y and improvement in autonomy? You need to be a special kind of gullible to believe that. However, there are many of those gullible people on Wall Street, and they completely miss what\u2019s happening with Tesla. First, they thought Tesla would deliver 50,000 more vehicles this quarter. Even after being comforted with their mistakes in terms of deliveries, they still grossly overestimated Tesla\u2019s earnings. As of this morning, the Wall Street consensus remained that Tesla would grow its deliveries in 2025. I hope they wake up and it\u2019s not the case tomorrow, but I doubt it.

Therefore, Newsom is giving the \u2018middle finger\u201d to Americans\u2026many of whom live in California.

Trump cleverly ran with a \u201cteam\u201d and SpaceX/Tesla CEO Elon Musk was prominent in the group effort. Specifically, Musk\u2019s team brought smart and tech-savvy people into look at the government books. Since Trump took office in January, Musk\u2019s team has uncovered vast swaths of waste, fraud and abuse\u2026and most Americans are shocked and appalled. But even before the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) hit the ground running, one organization was already identified as problematic. In November of 2024, AmeriCorps failed its eighth audit. This pattern of fiscal dysfunction raises serious questions about AmeriCorps\u2019 ability to operate effectively. Lawmakers\u2014and the incoming Donald Trump Administration should prioritize reviewing AmeriCorps\u2019 operations and consider significant reforms, reductions, or even its elimination to ensure responsible stewardship of public funds. AmeriCorps, the federal agency for national service and volunteerism , was established by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 during the Bill Clinton Administration. In FY 2024, it received $1.3 billion in taxpayer funding. While the \u201cvolunteer\u201d mission of this government agency may sound commendable, it has become a financial liability for American taxpayers, rife with waste, fraud, and abuse. Not only does this translate to inefficient use of taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned dollars, it also means that the aim of volunteerism and community service intended to help Americans in need throughout the country is not being effectively achieved. Just to underscore: The agency, established in 1993 and receiving over $1 billion in taxpayer funds each year, had seven chances to correct course. Yet, no change was made. The DOGE team reviewed the books thoroughly and made a few changes on behalf of the American people . AmeriCorps placed most staff members on administrative leave with pay this week, effective immediately, according to a staff member and an internal memo shared with The Associated Press. The memo from AmeriCorps\u2019 interim director told staff that the administrative leave would remain in effect until future notice. It was sent Wednesday, the day after the agency\u2019s National Civilian Community Corps members were informed that they would be discharged from their service terms early . The dismissal of young volunteers came as the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency make cuts to government workforce and services . About 15% of the agency\u2019s staff remained active, according to an AmeriCorps staff member who provided the internal communications to the AP on condition of anonymity because the staff member was not authorized to do so. AmeriCorps employs more than 500 full-time federal workers and has an operating budget of roughly $1 billion. \u201cDuring the period that you are on administrative leave you are not to enter AmeriCorps premises, access AmeriCorps systems, or attempt to use your position or authority with AmeriCorps in any way without my prior permission or prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command,\u201d the memo reads. We have already noted California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desperate bids for relevancy and money as the state budget collapses and his time in his current position is term-limited\u2026with that term ending just as the next presidential cycle begins. He has already filed 15 lawsuits in Trump\u2019s second term (and we aren\u2019t even 100 days in yet). He is now filing a 16th suit to undo the move recommended by the DOGE team . Newsom tried to be hip and edgy in his statement announcing the move by saying Trump was giving volunteers the \u2018middle finger\u2019. California is suing the White House and the federal Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, over cuts being made to AmeriCorps, Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., confirmed in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from the New Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society to a federal government that gives the middle finger to volunteers serving their fellow Americans. We will sue to stop this,\u201d Newsom said in a statement on his website. Earlier in the week, DOGE announced it was moving to eliminate virtually all jobs within the agency, placing a majority of employees on leave. JUST IN: Gov. Newsom announces California will sue the Trump admin/DOGE for cuts to AmeriCorps, saying it\u2019s a \u201cmiddle finger to volunteers\u201d CA\u2019s service corps is largest in the nation. This is CA\u2019s 16th lawsuit since the President took office in January. Newsom\u2019s statement: pic.twitter.com/xcfdJHE4v9 \u2014 Ashley Zavala (@ZavalaA) April 18, 2025 Here\u2019s the thing: People can volunteer to help their communities. However, the country cannot endure the scale of waste, fraud and abuse of the system at this scale for much longer. AmeriCorps was not fixable, and needs to be tossed into the ash-heap of history as another progressive policy failure. According to a Harvard CAPS / Harris poll, 76% of Americans support DOG E-led efforts for a full-scale investigation to root out fraud and waste in government expenditures. DOGE is doing the will of the people. And, as my colleague Elizabeth Stauffer noted, C alifornians are tired of Trump-Resistance-Theater. Therefore, Newsom is giving the \u201cmiddle finger\u201d to Americans\u2026many of whom live in California.

I suspect this program has become a patronage grift with \u2018volunteers\u2019 selected on criteria other than ability/skill sets and their project efforts directed to the benefit of donors and the politically connected.

Log in to Reply 0 1 CommoChief in reply to artichoke . | April 23, 2025 at 8:07 am Most of those tasks were accomplished by sending huge amounts of Taxpayer dollars to NGOs/charities. The Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church, among others, raked in tens of millions for it. The cuts by Trump Admin caused the Catholic US Conference of Bishops to terminate their efforts. Apparently that organization is only willing to be \u2018charitable\u2019 with taxpayer money and unwilling to.expand their own funds to keep up their efforts. Strange how often that seems to be the case with \u2018charities\u2019 and \u2018volunteer\u2019 efforts, usually turns out to be \u2018All about the Benjamins\u2019.

Log in to Reply 0 3 LB1901 | April 22, 2025 at 5:11 pm I\u2019m confused. Is California suing on behalf of the laid-off americorp \u2018volunteers\u2019? Or is California suing as a sovereign state for federal money withheld? If the latter, I would say California has not been injured, or damaged, and would have no standing. This case should be thrown out: no standing. Log in to Reply 0 2 DaveGinOly in reply to LB1901 . | April 22, 2025 at 5:45 pm Because the funding of federal agencies and offices is a matter for Congress to determine, and their operation is a matter for the POTUS, the continued operation of Americorps is a political question. The courts (or at least SCOTUS) have traditionally been reluctant to entertain such complaints. The reply to the complaint has already been provided in the last election cycle and a response to the reply will be given in the next. This is called \u201cdemocracy\u201d and it\u2019s how a \u201crepresentative government\u201d works. The judiciary controls neither the purse strings to fund federal programs nor the executive authority to direct their operations. Our system literally does not allow the judiciary a role in these matters. Log in to Reply 0 0 smooth in reply to LB1901 . | April 22, 2025 at 9:40 pm Newscum is flailing. Its what he does.

And when it did end up achieving something, those same laws prevented any exploitation that would have resulted in any actual benefit to the American people, instead of meaningless monuments to political glory, which feed nobody but politicians\u2019 egos.

PHOTO: AFP UPDATED Apr 23, 2025, 09:41 AM Thanks for sharing! AUSTIN - Tesla backed away from an earlier view for 2025 sales growth and pledged to revisit its outlook next quarter, a sign that tariffs, an ageing vehicle line-up and the backlash against chief executive officer Elon Musk are having an impact on the electric-vehicle maker. The company\u2019s first-quarter earnings plunged 71 per cent to US$409 million (S$536 million) , down from US$1.4 billion in the same period a year ago, it announced on April 22. Tesla omitted an earlier prediction that sales would return to growth for the full year, saying instead that it\u2019s \u201cmaking prudent investments that will set up\u201d the vehicle business for growth. That will depend on factors including production increases and the \u201cbroader macroeconomic environment\u201d. \u201cIt is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,\u201d Tesla said. Despite the weak results, Tesla shares rose 4.6 per cent in extended trading on April 22 after Mr Musk said he\u2019ll start to pull back \u201csignificantly\u201d his work with the US government starting in May. Mr Musk oversees five companies: Tesla, SpaceX, XAI, Neuralink and The Boring Co. Tesla is the only publicly traded company in his empire, and it has borne the brunt of public protests against him. The EV maker\u2019s dimmer outlook for the year follows a tough 2024, when it missed its annual sales growth target for the first time in more than a decade. Tesla reported earlier in April that first-quarter vehicle sales slid 13 per cent. US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are compounding Tesla\u2019s challenges, and threaten to upend automotive supply chains globally and drive up costs across the industry. While Tesla is expected to be relatively less affected than many carmakers due to its large plants in California and Texas, its vehicles nevertheless contain some non-US components, and the company has warned of a potential impact. Mr Ben Kallo, a senior research analyst with Baird, said Tesla\u2019s mention of tariffs is a way for the company to alert policymakers of the pain the levies are causing. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get the message across that tariffs are going to impact Elon without him saying that as part of the US government,\u201d Mr Kallo said. \u201cHe\u2019s walking a tight rope there while part of the government with Doge,\u201d he added , referring to the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency that Mr Trump created after taking office. Tariffs will have a \u201crelatively larger impact\u201d on the energy business compared to automotive, Tesla said. The company\u2019s Megapack energy storage systems rely heavily on LFP battery cells from China, which accounted for 84 per cent of global lithium-ion battery production capacity in 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie. By comparison, North America made up just 5 per cent. Consumer backlash Mr Musk\u2019s endorsement of controversial political positions in Europe and close ties to Mr Trump have also sparked a backlash globally. Tesla showrooms and charging stations have become targets for protests and vandalism, particularly in the United States. Tesla Takedown, a decentralised movement that accuses Mr Musk of harming democracies around the world, is encouraging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and the company\u2019s stock while condemning violence and vandalism. Earlier this week, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote that Tesla faces \u201cpotentially 15 per cent-20 per cent permanent demand destruction for future Tesla buyers due to the brand damage Musk has created with Doge\u201d. The company said that \u201cchanging political sentiment\u201d is another element that \u201ccould have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near term \u201d. Autonomy, robotics Mr Musk is increasingly betting Tesla\u2019s future on autonomy, such as a driverless taxi, and robotics, including the humanoid Optimus robot. \u201cWhile we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits,\u201d the company said in its shareholder deck. The automaker said plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for the start of production in the first half of this year. That may come as a surprise to some investors after Reuters reported last week that the production launch would be delayed by a few months. Tesla said it had already prepared its factories for the launch of new models during downtime while switching production lines over for the refreshed Model Y. It emphasised the need for more affordable options amid current economic uncertainty that has resulted from trade policies.

The embattled carmaker missed analysts' expectations by a mile, reporting that its net income had slid an astonishing 71 percent since the first quarter of last year. The company's total revenue is down nine percent compared to the same period last year. Its car business in particular has felt the pain, with revenue falling 20 percent as buyers increasingly look elsewhere in the face of constant controversy. The key figure responsible for the trouble is the company's CEO Elon Musk, who has been widely criticized for dragging the EV maker's brand through the mud with his extremist views and disastrous slashing of government budgets with the help of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency after contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to Donald Trump's reelection efforts. Growing anti-Musk sentiment has spawned an entire \"Tesla Takedown\" movement , with countless protesters showing up at showrooms across the country. Sales have fallen off a cliff across the globe , with longtime Tesla bull and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives warning that Musk had created a \"code red\" situation for the company. Earlier this month, Tesla revealed that the number of vehicles it delivered dropped by 13 percent in the first quarter of this year over the same period last year. Investors have voiced concerns over the mercurial CEO abandoning his carmaker in favor of gutting government agencies. \"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives argued in a Sunday note to clients . \"Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia.\" Complicating matters even further is Trump's trade war. A 25 percent tariff on auto imports could prove disastrous for Tesla. As the Wall Street Journal reports , Tesla relies on affected countries, including Mexico, for its auto parts. In a shareholder deck , Tesla confirmed that the trade war was hurting it. The company warned investors that \"uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.\" One area where it is making modest revenue: carbon credits it receives from other automakers, who paid it $595 million to offset the CO2 pollution from their gas vehicles. In short, Tesla is in a bad state right now. Its share price is down well over 50 percent since hitting an all-time high shortly after Trump was elected late last year. And the company isn't promising smoother waters ahead this year, writing only that it will \"revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.\" More on Tesla: Formerly Optimistic Tesla Megainvestor: \"Code Red\" Share This Article Read This Next Good Luck, Elon Tesla Leak Shows That Musk's Vision Is Trembling Who Wants a Cybertruck?

Photograph: David Zalubowski/AP Kana Inagaki Stephen Morris Tue Apr 22 2025 - 21:49 Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has said he will cut back his work for President Donald Trump after the company\u2019s first-quarter profit dropped by 39 per cent. Tesla\u2019s first-quarter results, published overnight, showed sales of its electric vehicles plummeted owing to a weak product line-up and a worldwide consumer backlash to Mr Musk\u2019s increased involvement in US politics. In response the billionaire said he would cut back his work as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) to a day or two per week starting sometime next month. Mr Musk\u2019s 130-day mandate as a special government employee in the Trump administration is set to expire around late May. READ MORE Is FIRE the route to retirement bliss?

Would you prefer a hotel room tax or higher property tax? \u201cI think starting probably next month, in May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,\u201d Mr Musk told investors on a conference call. Tesla has faced a troubling few months as deliveries of its aging lineup of electric vehicles have nosedived, Mr Musk\u2019s political activities have drawn protests, and its stock has nearly halved from its December peak. Many investors had been calling for Musk to leave his work as Trump\u2019s adviser and manage Tesla more closely. His political interventions have also hurt sales in big European markets this year. Tesla is banking on a revival in vehicle demand following the recent upgrade to its flagship Model Y car. Investors are also awaiting details on a new affordable vehicle it has promised. Adjusted net income for the first quarter fell 39 per cent from a year earlier to $934 million (\u20ac818 million), missing analyst expectations for $1.5 billion by a wide margin, according to a filing from the Austin, Texas-based company on Tuesday. Revenue fell 9 per cent to $19.3 billion, missing the average $21.4 billion analyst estimate, according to S&P Capital IQ. Earlier this month, Tesla reported that its deliveries fell 13 per cent in the first three months of this year, compared with a year before, marking its worst quarter since 2022. It also lost its crown as the world\u2019s largest electric-vehicle maker to Chinese rival BYD. Tesla\u2019s share price has halved from its high in mid-December. The group also faces growing risks from Mr Trump\u2019s trade war, which it has warned could make it a target for retaliatory tariffs and increase the cost of making vehicles in the United States. Patrick Guilbaud on bringing fine dining to Ireland, retirement plans, and not getting that third Michelin star Listen | 47:51 Tesla assembles all of its vehicles sold in the US locally but it is still exposed to the sweeping tariffs and disruptions to the global automotive supply chain since it sources components from other markets. \u201cWhile the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our energy business compared to automotive, we are taking actions to stabilise the business in the medium to long term and focus on maintaining its health,\u201d Tesla said in the earnings filing. Mr Musk has also clashed with Peter Navarro, the architect of Mr Trump\u2019s trade policies, and the White House has said his government role, which was originally meant to continue into 2026, could end well before that once his work with Doge is complete. Tesla\u2019s first-quarter operating margin also fell to 2.1 per cent from 5.5 per cent a year earlier. As of Tuesday, Doge estimated on its website that it has saved US taxpayers some $160 billion. However, the group\u2019s calculations have been rife with errors, corrections and incomplete explanations. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 and Reuters Tesla Electric vehicles Elon Musk US tariffs Donald Trump Peter Navarro IN THIS SECTION European shares rally towards three-week highs on easing US-China tensions Glanbia activist seeks to enlist Tirl\u00e1n in campaign for strategic review How Intel\u2019s recent difficulties have impacted its relationship with Ireland Tara Mines owner Boliden tops earnings estimates in first quarter OpenAI would buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser, ChatGPT chief says MOST READ \u2018I found out the rugby player I\u2019m seeing is four-timing me, and I am more attracted to him than ever\u2019 Garda whistleblower sues force over arrest by armed officers during football match with friends Irish hospitality group pays \u20ac1m for well-known Donegal hotel Mystery surrounds Joanna Donnelly\u2019s sudden departure from RT\u00c9 weather forecasting role Ireland\u2019s oldest woman (108) recalls Black and Tans and attributes long life to \u2018new nettles\u2019 in cabbage LATEST STORIES Fare changes and new \u2018Dublin commuter zone\u2019 will take effect from Monday, says Irish Rail FAI chief executive says it would be \u2018fantastic\u2019 if Irish person can succeed outgoing chief football officer \u2018I couldn\u2019t believe the bravery\u2019: Abuse survivors pay tribute to Michael O\u2019Brien and his \u2018powerful\u2019 RT\u00c9 testimony on child sex abuse Republic must share Omagh bombing information with inquiry, says North\u2019s former police ombudsman Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy clash again as US warns it could abandon Ukraine talks Business Today Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Sign up Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Cookie Information Cookie Settings Community Standards Copyright", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/22/tesla-profit-slumps-39-as-ev-sales-dry-up-and-tariff-worries-loom/", "source": "The Irish Times", "published_at": "2025-04-22T20:49:02"}, {"id": 2964, "title": "US DC fast charging network surges past 55K ports \u2013 and it\u2019s getting more reliable", "content": "US DC fast charging network surges past 55K ports \u2013 and it's getting more reliable | Electrek Skip to main content Tesla Supercharger EV Charging EV charging stations DC fast charging Inflation Reduction Act US DC fast charging network surges past 55K ports \u2013 and it\u2019s getting more reliable Michelle Lewis | Apr 22 2025 - 1:48 pm PT 3 Comments Mustang Mach-E with the new Ford Fast Charging Adapter (Source: Ford) US DC fast charging is becoming more reliable, and charging stations are getting bigger and busier, according to a new Q1 2025 report from the EV data analysts at Paren .

In addition, newer entrants into the field are bringing time-tested hardware along with enhanced driver experiences.\u201d Utah, Alaska, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Nevada were the top-ranked states for DC fast charging reliability in Q1 2025. Growth slows, but charging stations are getting larger New DC fast charging ports grew to 55,580 at the end of Q1 2025, up 3,667 from last quarter, with total stations reaching 10,839, an increase of 794. This is fewer new additions compared to the surge seen at the end of 2024, reflecting typical seasonal slowdowns due to winter weather. However, there\u2019s a bright spot: the average number of ports per station among non-Tesla networks rose to 3.9, compared to 2.7 year-over-year. The Tesla Supercharger network now averages 13 ports per station. Advertisement - scroll for more content Utilization rates reflect the urban-rural divide Average utilization \u2013 that\u2019s the minutes of a charging session as a percentage of time a station is open each day \u2013 dropped slightly from 16.6% in Q4 2024 to 16.2% in Q1 2025, following typical holiday travel patterns. But overall, charging use is climbing, especially in dense urban areas with significant rideshare and apartment communities that rely heavily on public chargers. Early days for NACS transition The Combined Charging System (CCS) remains dominant, with 59% of new ports, and the shift toward Tesla\u2019s NACS (J3400) standard is still in its very early stages. Only 104 non-Tesla NACS ports were added this quarter at non-Tesla networks, so drivers of new non-Tesla vehicles need to use their adapters if they want to use Superchargers. Fixed pricing prevails Charging operators primarily use fixed pricing (80%), with Time of Use (TOU) pricing making up 16%. Pay-by-time options are rare, used only 4.2% of the time. California is the only major state where TOU pricing surpasses fixed pricing, while many states, such as Oklahoma, Vermont, and Arkansas, almost exclusively utilize fixed pricing models. As for the most expensive places to fast charge your EV? The top four metropolitan statistical areas are all in California, with average rates at $0.60 or $0.61 per kWh. Rural and low-income areas at risk The Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program poses a significant threat to rural and low-income communities. Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, cautioned, \u201cOur data is a harbinger of less expansion in rural and lower-income markets as CPOs will increasingly focus on urban markets, seeing high utilization, often north of 30%, versus markets with less than 5% utilization.\u201d \u2018Charging 2.0\u2019 \u2013 a new industry phase McDonald summed up the report by marking 2024 as a pivotal year, stating, \u201c2024 was a year of mixed news in the US DC fast charging industry, but it will be remembered as a pivotal turn to a new era we are calling \u2018Charging 2.0\u2019. Charge-point operators and new players in the industry are increasingly focused on creating a great customer experience, improving reliability of chargers, and reaching profitability \u2013 a shift from chasing the availability of incentives, racing to get chargers in the ground, and then crossing your fingers that utilization will grow over time.\u201d Read more: Trump just canceled the federal NEVI EV charger program If you\u2019re an electric vehicle owner, charge up your car at home with rooftop solar panels.

Advertisement President Donald Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on auto imports \u2014 on top of 10% universal tariffs and tariffs on auto parts still to come. While Tesla manufactures the cars it sells in the U.S. in Texas and California, it relies on other countries for parts (Mexico supplies more than 20% of the automaker\u2019s parts). Advertisement Tesla left a return-to-growth forecast out of its earnings report, saying it would revisit its 2025 guidance in a Q2 update. \u201cIt is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,\u201d Tesla said in its earnings release. \u201cWhile we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment.\u201d Advertisement Tesla stock was up 1% in after-hours trading and was settling down as the data provided people with about what they expected. You\u2019d have to go back to October 2020 to find a post-earnings Tesla move that was under 1%. Four of the last five quarters saw double-digit swings. The stock is down 37% so far this year . CEO Elon Musk said in an earnings call Tuesday night that he remains \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about Tesla\u2019s future, saying he continues \u201cto believe that Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far \u2014 as valuable as the next five combined.\u201d Advertisement \u201cI encourage people to look beyond the bumps and potholes of the road immediately ahead of us and lift your gaze to the bright, shining citadel on the hill,\u201d Musk said. Plans for new vehicles \u2014 including more affordable models \u2014 remain on track to start production in the first half of 2025, the company announced without providing many more details. Investors had been looking forward to an announcement of vehicles that would be able to compete with lower-cost competitors (such as China\u2019s BYD ( BYDDY +2.70% )) or with Rivian ( RIVN +5.19% ). Advertisement \u201cThese vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup,\u201d the company said. Meanwhile, the Cybercab and Tesla Semi were changed to a \u201cconstruction\u201d designation, while the Roadster shifted to \u201cdesign development.\u201d And Tesla said its lithium refinery and cathode production plants in Texas are on track to start production this year. Advertisement Musk said Tesla\u2019s robotaxis would move the financial needle by the middle of next year. He also said Tesla\u2019s Optimus robots are coming along \u2014 he expects the scale-up to be faster than any other of the company\u2019s products (a million units per year in less than five years) and said there would be thousands of the robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year. There were a few other bright spots. Tesla\u2019s energy business grew 67%, and the company said its Powerwall deployments crossed 1 gigawatt-hour for the first time. However, Tesla warned that tariffs could cause market volatility and affect supply and demand \u2014 the batteries that the Megapack uses have cells that are largely imported from China.

Tesla touted its AI capabilities, saying, \u201cAI is a major pillar of growth for Tesla and the broader economy and key to our pursuit of sustainable abundance.\u201d Advertisement Still, it\u2019s been a bleak start to the year for the company. In early April, Tesla reported its worst quarterly sales in years; its 336,000 delivered units were well below Wall Street\u2019s already low expectations. Last week, data showed that the automaker\u2019s share of California\u2019s enormous EV market fell to 43.9% in the first quarter from 55.5% a year ago. Tesla recently pulled options to buy its Model S and X EVs from its website in China. Even used Tesla prices are plunging. Advertisement While Tesla\u2019s shareholder deck didn\u2019t mention Musk \u2014 even once \u2014 the downturn from the once-heralded company comes as his political affiliations continue to hurt the auto company. The CEO has been the face of the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (DOGE) cost- and job-cutting measures, and Musk has been seen at the White House (or in photo ops with the president) countless times. As a result, people looking to protest the president and his administration\u2019s policies have found an easy target in the automaker. Nonviolent, anti-Tesla protests have popped up across the globe, while vandalism against the company\u2019s vehicles and facilities has increased. Advertisement When reports this month suggested that Musk would be leaving his government role (his designation as a special government employee is set to expire by the end of May), Tesla\u2019s stock rose. The blowback the company has faced as a result of Musk\u2019s role with DOGE was the first thing the CEO addressed on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call. He said his with the \u201cdepartment\u201d is critical and alleged that protests against the company were \u201corganized and paid for.\u201d He confirmed that he will step back from his governmental role next month \u2014 adding, however, that he\u2019ll continue to spend \u201ca day a two a week\u201d on DOGE matters, or as long as Trump wants him to.

Prev Next Jae C. Hong/AP FILE- Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks before unveiling the Model Y at Tesla's design studio, March 14, 2019, in Hawthorne, Calif. By: AP via Scripps News Group Posted and last updated Tesla's first-quarter profits plunged by more than two-thirds amid a boycott of Elon Musk's electric car company that has hurt sales and sent its stock plunging. The Austin, Texas, company reported a 71% drop in profits and a 9% decline in revenue for the first quarter. Tesla's revenue fell to $19.3 billion in the January through March period, below Wall Street's forecast. The disappointing results come as the company is fighting a backlash due to Musk's leadership of a federal government jobs-cutting group that has divided the country and sparked angry protests. Some analysts have called for Musk to abandon his role in the Trump administration to focus on Tesla. Shares of Tesla Inc. have tumbled more than 40% this year. The company that once dominated EVs is also facing fierce competition for the first time. Earlier this year, Chinese EV maker BYD announced it had developed an electric battery charging system that can fully power up a vehicle within minutes. And Tesla's European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real alternatives, just as popular opinion in Europe has turned against Musk. Investors expect Tesla will be hurt less by the Trump administration's tariffs than most U.S. car companies because it makes most of its U.S. cars domestically. But Tesla won't be completely unscathed. It sources some materials from abroad that will now face import taxes. Retaliation from China will also hurt Tesla. The company was forced earlier this month to stop taking orders from mainland customers for two models, its Model S and Model X. It makes the Model Y and Model 3 for the Chinese market at its factory in Shanghai. Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

The electric automotive manufacturer and energy company lost $566 million in projected profits after sales in the first three months of 2025 fell short, according to its filing on Tuesday. Newsweek has reached out to Tesla for comment. Why It Matters Since Musk took on his role as de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he and Tesla have been linked to the Trump administration's sweeping federal cuts and mass layoffs. The backlash has led to worldwide boycotts and protests at dealerships , as well as its vehicles being vandalized and Tesla owners being mocked\u2014all of which has led to a drastic drop in sales. Tesla is also facing tough competition from other electric vehicle (EV) makers, including Chinese rival BYD, which has seen a 75 percent increase in sales across the U.K., Germany and France over the same period. A recent study by Electrify Research found that Tesla had slipped from being the most desirable EV brand in July 2023 to seventh place behind Audi , Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, Porsche and Volkswagen.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the opening of the Tesla factory Berlin Brandenburg in Gruenheide, Germany, on March 22, 2022. Patrick Pleul/AP What To Know Tesla reported a big drop in first-quarter earnings Tuesday, with quarterly earnings plunging by 71 percent, revenue falling 9 percent to $19.3 billion and total automotive revenue down by 20 percent. Sales also suffered a 13 percent drop , with global deliveries falling to 336,681 vehicles between January and March from 387,000 a year prior. This marked Tesla's worst quarter for deliveries since 2022. The company cited \"uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets\" because of Trump's tariffs, as well as \"changing political sentiment\" for the lackluster sales. The EV firm said updates to its best-selling Model Y also effected its availability for customers and impacted sales. Its fourth-quarter results also came in below analysts' estimates, with revenue increasing just 2 percent year-over-year to $25.7 billion, automotive revenue falling 8 percent to $19.8 billion, and net income plummeting 71 percent to $2.3 billion. Tesla shares saw some recovery on Tuesday, rising 4.6 percent, despite the gloomy report, after a steep drop on Monday. However, the company's shares have been in decline since they peaked on December 17 at 488.54. They have since dropped by more than half to Tuesday's 237.97. In a recent note, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives warned that Musk faces a \"code red situation\" if his position as figurehead of DOGE continues to damage the brand image. \"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full time,\" he said. It appears that Musk is heeding the pressure and may be returning to Tesla full time as early as next month. The Tesla CEO was hired as a special government employee, which means he can work only 130 days in a 365-day time period, setting a deadline of May 30. President Donald Trump has suggested Musk will abide by the rule, saying on April 3 that Musk will be leaving government in \"a few months.\" Musk said during the earnings call that starting next month, his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly.\" What People Are Saying Tesla, in its first-quarter earnings report: \"Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term. We remain committed to expanding our business model to include delivering autonomous robots across multiple form factors and use cases \u2013 powered by our real-world AI expertise \u2013 to our customers and for use in our factories, as we navigate these headwinds.\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, in a note released Sunday: \"If Musk leaves the White House, there will be permanent brand damage...but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full-time CEO to drive the vision and the long-term story will not be altered. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla...brand damage will grow....A huge week ahead for Musk, Tesla and investors.\" Professor Jack Stilgoe, University College London, told Newsweek : \"Until now, Tesla's valuation has priced in Elon Musk's claim that what he calls 'full self-driving' is just around the corner. It's a story that seems to have worked pretty until now, even though anyone close to the technology knows that it doesn't work as promised. And, strictly speaking, it can never work as promised. There's no way a Tesla will be able to drive itself in all possible circumstances. It's a form of magical thinking that has kept the company going for years.\" President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One this month: \"I want [Elon] to stay as long as possible. There's going to be a point where he's going to have to leave.\" What Happens Next Musk is expected to return to Tesla in a more full-time capacity next month. Is This Article Trustworthy?

SK Telecom is South Korea\u2019s largest wireless telecom company, a major player in the country\u2019s mobile and tech landscape. It holds about 48% of the market share for mobile services, meaning around 34 million subscribers use its network. The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure. The carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea\u2019s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more). SK Telecom reported threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys. The telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date. SK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts. The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the \u2018SIM protection service\u2019 for free. \u201cOn April 19, 2025, at approximately 11:00 PM, SK Telecom discovered circumstances in which some SIM-related information of SK Telecom customers was suspected to have been leaked due to malware.\u201d reads the data breach notification published by the company. \u201cSK Telecom immediately deleted the malware after recognizing the possibility of a leak and isolated the suspected hacking device. As of now, there have been no confirmed cases of actual exploitation of the information, but we are implementing the following measures to prevent damage to our customers.\u201d The company is still investigating the security breach to determine the exact cause, the scale of the incident, and determine the leaked data. The South Korean provider also reported the data leak to the Personal Information Protection Commission at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 22. Customers who want additional security measures could sign up for SIM protection service .

Skip to Content Get more news Live on / Updated By Rob Wile and David Ingram Tech billionaire Elon Musk said Tuesday that he will begin dedicating more time to Tesla and less to his work with the Trump administration starting next month, providing a relief to Tesla investors fed up with his political work and signaling a possible shift in power at the White House. Musk's comments came on Tesla's call with investors following the company reporting a sizable drop in first-quarter profit and revenue. The company warned that the political environment along with the Trump administration's tariff plans were challenges for its business. \"Starting probably next month, May, my time obligation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said, referring to his Department of Government Efficiency. \"I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so, and for as long as it is useful, but starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla, now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done,\" he said. Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has faced a swell of opposition for his work with President Donald Trump, which has made Tesla a growing target for protests and even vandalism . Musk has acknowledged that his move into politics has hit the company's stock price . Tesla \u2014 which is increasingly trying to diversify into high-tech products like robots \u2014 said profits fell 71% to $409 million, compared with $1.39 billion during the same quarter one year ago. Shares of Tesla were up about 4% in after-hours trading, though the company has lost 50% of its value from its mid-December peak. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk's announcement. Musk reiterated on the call that he intends to pivot Tesla from its established electric car business into two new products: robotaxis and humanoid robots, two ideas that investors have been skeptical about . Musk said that Tesla was still on track to begin selling robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, in June, putting Tesla into head-to-head competition with Google spinoff Waymo, which launched robotaxi rides there in March via the Uber app . Tesla, in its written earnings report, said that \"uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets\" associated with \"rapidly evolving trade policy,\" along with \"changing political sentiment,\" could have \"a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\" It also said updates to its best-selling Model Y that affected its availability on the market contributed to the shortfall. \"We remain committed to expanding our business model to include delivering autonomous robots across multiple form factors and use cases \u2014 powered by our real-world AI expertise \u2014 to our customers and for use in our factories, as we navigate these headwinds,\" it said. It said it was not prepared to provide guidance for performance the rest of the year \u2014 a decision other companies are also making \u2014 because of broad trends that include the impact from tariffs. Tesla has boasted that is \"the most American-made\" car , but it still faces tariff exposure due to imported parts. It said it would \"revisit\" guidance for 2025 in three months. \"It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,\" Tesla said in the outlook section of its report. Musk, on the conference call, said he pressed Trump to reverse course on his tariff policy but was not successful. \"I'm one of many advisers to the president. I'm not the president, but I've made my opinion clear to the president,\" he said. \"I'm an advocate of predictable tariff structures.\" Musk has faced pressure from many sides , including from investors who would like him to pay more attention to the company and from his job in the Trump administration, where he has volunteered to slash government programs. Musk has kept his CEO roles at Tesla and SpaceX even while he has spent much of his time with President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, the group charged with reducing federal spending. A CNBC All-America Economic survey released earlier Tuesday underscored the depth of the negative sentiment toward Tesla and Musk: 47% of the public had negative views of the company versus 27% positive, and half had negative views of Musk, compared with 36% who saw him positively. \"Tesla has become a political symbol around the world,\" Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said in an interview on CNBC after the earnings report was released. Ives said the political controversy has hurt Tesla not only by reducing demand for vehicles but also because Tesla has become a target for retaliatory tariffs by other nations, such as China. The earnings report did not explicitly mention the repeated vandalism against Tesla vehicles or the peaceful protests at its showrooms, instead citing the \"changing political sentiment\" as a headwind for demand. A key question for Tesla, Musk and the Trump administration has been how long Musk will remain in his White House position. His job as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d is time-limited by law to 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days, which could put his legally mandated endpoint as early as late May. Musk told Fox News this month that he believed \u201cmost\u201d of his work would be done by the deadline.

A protester from Extinction Rebellion spraypaints \"DOGE\" with \"no\" symbol through it on a Tesla showroom window \u00a9 Oliya Scootercaster/FreedomNews.TV via X The one thing Elon Musk really can\u2019t have right now as he serves as the absentee CEO of Tesla is more negative attention\u2014not only can his ego not handle it, as a recent report from the Washington Post suggested, but his car company\u2019s reputation really cannot suffer any more hits. So it\u2019s hard to imagine he\u2019s thrilled about Extinction Rebellion, the occasionally controversial environmental movement, spray painting the windows of Tesla dealerships with anti-Musk messaging at a time when his tarnished image is already seemingly costing the company money. FreedomNews.TV documented protesters with the non-violent protest group hitting up a Tesla showroom in Manhattan on Tuesday, using spray paint to leave messages in opposition to Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. Demonstrators sprayed \u201cFuck DOGE\u201d and \u201cWe do not consent\u201d among other generally anti-Musk positions on the building as part of an Earth Day demonstration. It\u2019s a pretty daring campaign given the Trump administration\u2019s stated goal to crack down on those who vandalize Tesla dealerships and threats to hit the worst offenders with terrorism charges. BREAKING: Climate Activists TAG windows of Tesla Showroom in Manhattan on #EarthDay Extinction Rebellion tagged \"F Off DOGE\" and \"WE DO NOT CONSENT\" among other writings on the windows. pic.twitter.com/XMHBYnBxwY \u2014 Oliya Scootercaster \ud83d\udef4 (@ScooterCasterNY) April 22, 2025 It also happens to come on the same day that Tesla is expected to report its first quarter earnings for 2025, in what some investors see as a potential make-or-break moment for the company. Tesla\u2019s stock price has taken a hit over the course of this year as Musk\u2019s role in government has drawn the ire of protesters and hurt the electric vehicle company\u2019s brand . Certainly, the litany of demonstrations outside of Tesla dealerships has not been great for overall morale or the bottom line . Dealerships and showrooms have been the target of organized protests and seemingly less organized attacks that have included shooting out windows and setting vehicles on fire. Tesla drivers, embarrassed by the car\u2019s association with Musk and in some cases afraid of getting heckled, have either ditched their cars or tried to cover their shame by covering up the branding . Theoretically, and certainly in Musk\u2019s version of reality, environmental activists would support Tesla, seeing as it\u2019s arguably the most noteworthy electric vehicle. But the thing is, when you throw your full weight behind an administration that straight up does not believe climate change is a real thing , intends to drill for more oil and burn more coal , and generally just revel in doing things that harm the planet , you kinda lose your credibility with that crowd. Instead, the world\u2019s richest man is learning that you can buy a seat next to the President in the White House, but you can\u2019t buy goodwill with the general public. It seems like it\u2019ll be hard for Musk to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue. Even if he steps away from DOGE, which he might just have to do anyway due to the law , getting his reputation back among those most inclined to buy a Tesla is going to be a bit harder than just scrubbing off the anti-DOGE graffiti from a showroom window.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) See 5 more photos US stocks jumped in a widespread rally Tuesday and more than made up for their sharp drops from the day before The S&P 500 rose 129.56 points, or 2.5%, to 5,287.76 to erase Monday's loss, which came on worries about President Trump's trade war and his attacks on the head of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,016 points, or 2.7%, to 39,186.98. The Nasdaq composite climbed 429.52 points, or 2.7%, to 16,300.42. Equifax, 3M, and other companies reporting better profits than analysts expected helped lead the way, the AP reports. The value of the US dollar also stabilized after sliding against the euro and other competitors, while Treasury yields held steadier in the bond market. Equifax jumped 13.8% after reporting better profit for the first three months of 2025 than analysts expected. It also said it would send more cash to its shareholders by increasing its dividend and buying up to $3 billion of its stock over the next four years. 3M climbed 8.3% after the maker of Scotch tape and Command strips said it made more in profit from each $1 of revenue during the start of the year than it expected. The company also stood by its forecast for profit for the full year, though it said tariffs may drag down its earnings per share by up to 40 cents per share. Homebuilder PulteGroup rose 8.4% after it likewise delivered a stronger profit for the start of 2025 than analysts expected. Tesla rose 4.6% ahead of its earnings report, which is scheduled to arrive after trading ends for the day. That trimmed its loss for the year so far to roughly 41%. First Solar jumped 10.5% after the Department of Commerce finalized harsher-than-expected solar tariffs on some southeast Asian communities. US defense contractors, meanwhile, had some of the market's sharpest losses after RTX said tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, along with other products, could mean an $850 million hit to its profit this year. RTX, which builds airplane engines and military equipment, fell 9.8% even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter. (More stock market stories.)

Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla. \"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\" That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line. But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe , causing the stock price to deflate. Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month. \"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said. But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said. Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\" Tariff impact The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas. Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call. The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\" Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded. What time is the Tesla earnings call? Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts. Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading. Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations. Tesla sales drop 13% from last year, signaling trouble for Elon Musk 02:35 In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead. But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout. Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said. In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.

After enduring a brutal pummeling, one that has seen its stock decline by nearly 50 percent in what is inarguably one of the fastest transitions from outright euphoria to abject despondency in the stock market's long history, Tesla has just disclosed its earnings for the first quarter of 2025, managing to post broadly negative results relative to Wall Street's consensus expectations.

Do note that Wall Street analysts expected Tesla to disclose $14.119 billion in automotive revenue, $3.157 billion in energy-related bookings, and $2.733 billion in revenue from other sources.

Also, do note that the EV giant earned $595 million via regulatory credits in Q1. The following snippet summarizes the company's latest guidance: Tesla Guidance Tesla continues to contend with brand damage in the US and the EU, and heightened competition in China. Moreover, due to the recent tariff-driven upheaval, the EV giant has reportedly delayed the start of trial production for the Cybercab and the Semi. Also, Tesla has purportedly delayed the launch of a stripped-down version of the Model Y, originally expected to launch in H1 2025. *TESLA 1Q REV. $19.34B, EST. $21.37B *TESLA LEAVES OUT RETURN TO GROWTH FORECAST FROM EARNINGS REPORT Tesla earnings and forward guidance goes about as bad as possible. And this was after massive downward revisions all quarter long. \u2014 Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) April 22, 2025 However, in its guidance, Tesla has reiterated that the cheaper Model Y will enter production in H1 2025, and the Cybercab's launch is still expected in 2026. Do note that Tesla does not actually project when it would return to growth. This is a major red flag. Tesla intends to provide a special \"company update\" during its earnings call. We'll continue to update this post with relevant details. Elon Musk: \"There will probably be some bumps this year (for Tesla), but I remain extremely Optimus about the future of the company.\" \u2014 Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) April 22, 2025 Elon Musk says he is \"extremely Optimus about the future of the company.\" The CEO of the EV giant thinks autonomy would start to move the needle for the company starting in the middle to the second half of 2026. Also, Musk just said that his DOGE work is \"mostly done,\" and that he'll spend a lot more time at Tesla starting next month. Tesla CFO: \"The negative impact of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards our brand and our people, had an impact in certain markets. Despite this, we were able to sell out legacy Model Y. We produced the legacy Model Y until the end of February.\" \u2014 Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) April 22, 2025 The EV giant's CFO underplayed the supposed brand damage to Tesla from Elon Musk's political activities, asserting that the \"unwarranted hostility\" only had an impact in certain markets. Elon Musk further clarified that \"absent from macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand.\" On the autonomy front, Musk said that Unsupervised FSD will launch on the Model Y in Austin, Texas, this June. By the end of 2025, Tesla intends to roll out this service to a number of US cities. Also, the EV giant will start operating between 10 and 20 robotaxis in Austin this June. NEWS: Tesla says the more affordable models that will be built in the coming months will resemble the form and shape of the cars that Tesla currently makes. \"The key is that they will be affordable and that you'll be able to buy one.\" Sounds like a stripped down Model Y. \u2014 Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) April 22, 2025 On the topic of the upcoming more affordable models, Elon Musk detailed that those products would resemble the form factor of the EV giant's current lineup. As far as the Cybercab is concerned, Elon Musk thinks that it will be built 6x faster than the Model Y, rolling off the assembly line every 5 seconds vs. the 33 seconds for the Model Y. Tesla shares are up around 5 percent as of the time of the last update (19:37 EDT). Judging from this reaction, Elon Musk seems to have worked his magic one more time.

The electric automaker reported $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue after delivering almost 337,000 EVs in the first quarter of the year. The company\u2019s net income reflects a 71% drop from the same quarter last year. It was the worst quarter for Tesla deliveries in more than two years and came on the heels of the company\u2019s first-ever year-to-year drop in sales . Tesla\u2019s income was buffered by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits, according to its earnings report \u2014 without those, it would have posted a loss. And yet, Tesla stock rose in after-hours trading as investors put more weight on the company\u2019s plans to begin production on an affordable EV in June and CEO Elon Musk\u2019s comments during an earnings call that he would reduce his role with the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more attention on Tesla. Musk did not commit to ending his DOGE work altogether though, noting he may continue in some capacity through the remainder of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. TechCrunch published a roundup of other Musk comments covering tariffs, robotaxis, AI, and EVs, during Tesla\u2019s earnings call. Tesla also cautioned shareholders about how the trade war may affect its business moving forward. The company said President Trump\u2019s tariffs and \u201cchanging political sentiment\u201d could have a \u201cmeaningful impact on demand for our products.\u201d The company noted the current tariffs, the bulk of which are directed at China, will have \u201ca relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.\u201d Tesla said it is taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long term and focus on maintaining its health, but it also cautioned investors that it can\u2019t say whether it will be able to grow sales this year. Tesla is sticking to its ambitious (but mysterious) plans around making more affordable models, stating it remains on track for start of production of these vehicles in the first half of 2025. During the earnings call, Musk was more specific, stating production would begin in June. These vehicles will use aspects of a next-generation platform that powers the robotaxi, but will rely on its existing one that powers the Model Y and Model 3, the company said in its shareholder\u2019s letter. As such, these cheaper vehicles will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as the current vehicle lineup, the company said. This flies in the face of a Reuters report from last week that claimed the first of these new EVs is delayed by months . Tesla\u2019s sales are up against a number of headwinds. The company\u2019s EV lineup is aging (though the sedans and SUVs have now all gotten face-lifts) and its newest product, the Cybertruck, is nowhere near the hit that CEO Elon Musk thought it could be. And Musk\u2019s far-right politics, along with his involvement in the Trump administration, have created a sizable backlash to Tesla\u2019s brand. At the same time, Musk has oriented the company toward its Robotaxi and Optimus robot projects. He has promised to launch an initial version of the Robotaxi service in Austin this June, with other cities potentially coming by the end of this year, but has been light on details about how it will work. Musk has yet to demonstrate that Teslas are capable of driving themselves without human intervention despite years of making that promise. What\u2019s more, The Information recently reported that an internal analysis done at Tesla showed the Robotaxi program would lose money for a long period of time even if it were to work . At this time last year, Tesla was grappling with some gloomy numbers. In case you forgot, the company\u2019s profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from the same period in 2023. Tesla said it was due to a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and \u201cseveral unforeseen challenges\u201d cut into the automaker\u2019s bottom line. Tesla tried to turn that profit ship around, but faced continued pressure. In Q2 of 2024, Tesla reported $1.5 billion in profit, down 45% from the same period in 2023. Profits were hit by a $622 million restructuring charge. Although it\u2019s worth noting, that profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales.

Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla released its first quarter financial earnings today, offering another peek into the crisis currently enveloping Elon Musk\u2019s company. Tesla said it earned $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue. That\u2019s below Wall Street expectations of $21.1 billion and represents a 9.4 percent decrease year over year compared to $21.3 billion in revenue in Q1 2024. The company\u2019s profits also slid dramatically, logging a 71 percent decrease in net income for the first quarter. And Tesla\u2019s automotive revenue \u2014 the money is earns from car sales \u2014 slid 20 percent year over year, from $17.4 billion in Q1 2024 to $13.9 billion in this most recent quarter. The sale of $595 million in regulatory credits once again buoyed Tesla\u2019s finances \u2014 without which the company would have had to report a year over year loss. In a letter to shareholders , Tesla acknowledged that tariffs, as well as \u201cchanging political sentiment,\u201d will continue to complicate efforts to grow out of its current rut. \u201cUncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,\u201d Tesla said. \u201cThis dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\u201d Tesla was expected to be largely insulated from tariffs, thanks to its domestic supply chain. But the company says that its energy business, which includes solar panels and home battery products, will be hurt by the Trump administration\u2019s trade war. \u201cWhile the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive, we are taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long-term and focus on maintaining its health,\u201d the company wrote. In January, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow in 2025, but didn\u2019t specify by how much. Now the company is rethinking that guidance and will update it after next quarter: It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment. We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update. It wasn\u2019t all bad news: Tesla\u2019s gross margins, 16.3 percent in the first quarter, came in above analysts\u2019 expectations of 15.82%, according to estimates compiled by LSEG, Reuters reports. The earnings comes on the heels of Tesla\u2019s worst quarterly sales report in three years . The company said it delivered a total of 336,681 vehicles, a 12.9 percent decline compared to Q1 2024. (For a direct-to-consumer company like Tesla, deliveries are a proxy for sales.) After years of exponential growth, the sudden reversal in Tesla\u2019s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash. Tesla now serves as a sobering example of what happens when a company is left on autopilot (or Autopilot , as it were) while its high-profile CEO gets distracted by questionable side projects . The sudden reversal in Tesla\u2019s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash Tesla\u2019s current troubles can be traced back to Musk\u2019s position with the Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE, a specious effort to cut \u201cwaste and fraud\u201d in the government that appears mostly aimed at eliminating humanitarian aid programs, cancelling critical scientific research, and terrorizing federal workers. He has also amplified racist and antisemitic theories on social media , attacked trans people (including his own daughter), and made a fascist salute during Trump\u2019s inauguration. Tesla\u2019s shares are down over 37 percent year-to-date, as investors beg Musk to put aside his political activities and refocus his attention on his primary company. Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s antics have spawned a nationwide protest movement called Tesla Takedown, aimed at boycotting the company and driving down its stock price. And it appears to be successful in persuading many progressive Tesla owners to sell their vehicles, despite steep drops in used car values. There have also been an unrelated spate of violent attacks on Tesla stores and vehicles around the world, including several cases of arson and vandalism . President Donald Trump has said suspects caught defacing Tesla vehicles would be charged with \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Musk is pinning his hopes on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars , which he argues will propel Tesla to new financial heights. He claims the company will launch an \u201cunsupervised\u201d robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, in June. But his past promises about autonomous driving have failed to come true. And experts have questioned Tesla\u2019s approach to the technology , pointing to dozens of fatal crashes that have occurred involving the company\u2019s partially automated features. But the company\u2019s on-again, off-again pursuit of a lower cost EV is what best exemplifies Tesla\u2019s off-the-rails moment. For years, Musk has been promising an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000, as a way to broaden the appeal of plug-in vehicles. But instead the company spent precious resources on the polarizing, unpopular Cybertruck. And now recent reports suggest that Tesla\u2019s efforts to build a more affordable Model Y \u2014 its most popular model \u2014 is significantly delayed. The company reaffirmed its plans for new affordable models in the first half of 2025, noting in the shareholder letter that the changeover to the new assembly line for the refreshed Model Y also included prep for new vehicles later this year. \u201cGiven economic uncertainty resulting from changing trade policy, more affordable options are as critical as ever,\u201d the company wrote. Musk and his executive team are expected to address all these issues and more in a call with investors at 5:30 pm ET. Tesla also said it would host a \u201clive company update\u201d including a question and answer session, in another sign that the company sees this moment as particularly fraught.

The United States had withdrawn from the World Health Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Council; the State Department seemed more preoccupied with deportations than with diplomacy. Yet some international work remained possible inside agencies with a primarily domestic agenda. At the Department of Labor, for instance, grants were still funding nonprofits that educated migrant farmworkers about their rights to fair recruitment, and groups that tackled human trafficking in countries that export products to the United States, from Congolese cobalt to Colombian flowers. (The Tariff Act of 1930 bans imports of goods made by forced labor, and campaigns against such exploitation have been historically bipartisan.) The Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of International Labor Affairs, or ILAB \u2014which was created just after the Second World War\u2014was still sending investigators to factories and training judges abroad to enforce labor provisions in various trade accords, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (U.S.M.C.A.), the update to the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) that Donald Trump negotiated in his first term. \u201cThis work is of interest to the Administration,\u201d one ILAB employee told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I thought would save us.\u201d Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump\u2019s new Labor Secretary, was sworn in on March 11th. She moved quickly to comply with the O.M.B. request\u2014and with the Administration\u2019s overarching objective of shrinking the federal government. Large posters of her, captioned \u201c LET\u2019S GET TO WORK ,\u201d went up in the elevators at D.O.L. headquarters, in Washington. Within days, she had cancelled a number of ILAB grants. She posted the news to X, boasting of having saved thirty million dollars \u201cby eliminating \u2018America Last\u2019 programs in foreign countries like Indonesia, Colombia, Guatemala, Chile, & Brazil.\u201d Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) account reposted it, writing, \u201cGreat job.\u201d According to Business Insider , three DOGE employees were stationed at the D.O.L., including Miles Collins, who reportedly co-owns Pacific Fertility Center, a Los Angeles clinic that is being sued for employment discrimination for, among other things, denying a pregnancy-related medical leave. (Pacific Fertility Center did not respond to a request for comment.) In late March, DOGE praised Chavez-DeRemer and the Labor Department for cancelling all remaining \u201c \u2018America Last\u2019 grants for $237M in savings.\u201d These funds would instead go to the \u201cAMERICAN Workforce,\u201d the D.O.L. wrote on X, though Congress had specifically earmarked them for \u201cprograms to combat exploitative child labor internationally\u201d and \u201cprograms that address worker rights\u201d in countries with which the U.S. trades. \u201cWe learned this morning that the Department has taken a decision to immediately terminate all of ILAB \u2019s existing grants,\u201d Mark Mittelhauser, the associate deputy under-secretary who ran ILAB , wrote to some hundred and fifty employees of the bureau. Those in charge of administering and evaluating programs in dozens of countries were dumbfounded. There was an immediate stop to projects supporting collective bargaining in Mexico, addressing worker abuses in Southeast Asian fisheries, and reducing child labor and sexual exploitation in Madagascar\u2019s mica mines. On X, the D.O.L. posted a cartoon meme deriding ILAB for \u201c FUNDING UZBEKISTAN\u2019S COTTON INDUSTRY .\u201d In fact, ILAB and its grantees had advocated for years to target child and forced labor in that country, one of the world\u2019s top cotton producers, so that American businesses weren\u2019t undermined by an artificially cheap supply. The United States Fashion Industry Association and the American Apparel & Footwear Association wrote to Chavez-DeRemer, pleading for her not to end the program. Grantees such as the International Labour Organization, the Solidarity Center, and the American Institutes for Research made plans to lay off staff all over the world. A second ILAB employee told me, \u201cWe\u2019re basically saying to the rest of the world, \u2018Go ahead.\u2019 It\u2019s profitable for businesses to have supply chains that aren\u2019t ethical, employing children, forcing people to work.\u201d Mittelhauser was abruptly placed on administrative leave in early April and marched out of D.O.L. headquarters. Chavez-DeRemer temporarily replaced him with her chief of staff, Jihun Han, who worked for Chavez-DeRemer when she was a member of Congress. (She was elected in 2022 and served one term.) Chavez-DeRemer sent an e-mail to employees at ILAB and three other sub-agencies\u2014the Women\u2019s Bureau, the Office of Public Affairs, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs\u2014urging them to consider early retirement or \u201cdeferred resignation,\u201d in which employees are placed on leave for a period of months before their official separation. Mass layoffs would be coming soon. She later extended this offer to all of the D.O.L. On the fifth floor of headquarters, ILAB staff cried in the halls. \u201cEveryone was constantly fearing for their job,\u201d a third, longtime ILAB employee told me. \u201cThey\u2019ll show up one day, and their cards to get in will just be shut off\u2014the mental fuck of the whole thing.\u201d Meanwhile, the D.O.L. posted a gauzy head shot of Chavez-DeRemer, captioned \u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY, MADAM SECRETARY,\u201d on X, and threw a party. Wine and flowers were set atop dark-blue tablecloths; Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s photograph was projected on large monitors. The \u201cAlt U.S. Department of Labor\u201d account on Bluesky posted , \u201cDoes it get any more \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 than golf tournaments and birthday soirees?\u201d (Trump had just returned from a golfing weekend in Palm Beach.) Employees scribbled \u201cResist\u201d in the elevators and taped over the Chavez-DeRemer posters with a two-part meme of the singer Drake: in one image, he frowns and turns away from the phrase \u201cUsing taxpayer dollars to end unsafe working conditions\u201d; in the other, he smiles and points approvingly at \u201cUsing taxpayer dollars to throw yourself a birthday party.\u201d (Courtney Parella, a D.O.L. spokesperson, denied that it was a birthday party and said that whatever cake was there had been purchased by Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s family.) Yesterday, an hour and a half after The New Yorker e-mailed a list of fact-checking queries and requests for comment to the D.O.L., Han, the chief of staff, sent a memo to all department employees, warning them not to speak with the media. Doing so, he said, could lead to serious legal consequences, including \u201cpotential criminal penalties.\u201d At least one employee has filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that protects federal whistle-blowers, alleging an improper \u201cgag order.\u201d Last week, the vast majority of staff in the D.O.L.\u2019s contract-oversight division, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (O.F.C.C.P.), either resigned or were put on indefinite leave. \u201cWe were given one hour of notice before being told we had to leave the office, and locked out of all D.O.L. systems,\u201d an O.F.C.C.P. employee in California told me. In the past fiscal year, the division recovered $22.5 million for more than twelve thousand workers who had been discriminated against by contractors. \u201cSome of those recoveries were for white males,\u201d the employee added. The employee believed that the Administration and DOGE had targeted O.F.C.C.P. because of a pending \u201ccompliance review\u201d of fair-employment practices at Musk\u2019s Tesla plant in Fremont, California. That review was largely abandoned in early February. (Tesla recently settled a suit by a Black worker at the plant who said that racial slurs had been written all over the walls and that a manager repeatedly greeted employees by saying, \u201cWelcome to the slave house.\u201d Other suits are pending.) There is now almost no one left to make sure that private companies receiving billions of dollars from the government comply with civil-rights laws. Parella, the D.O.L. spokesperson, said that the changes at O.F.C.C.P. have \u201cnothing to do with Elon Musk and everything to do with restoring merit-based opportunity.\u201d ILAB staff took an informal census of who would be leaving through deferred resignation and early retirement, and counted forty per cent of the bureau. Several employees told me that they had felt pushed out; they had no real choice. Teams within ILAB hosted get-togethers in person and online, to wish their colleagues goodbye. It wasn\u2019t clear who would perform tasks that are required by statute: investigating and publishing annual reports on child labor and forced labor; co\u00f6rdinating with Customs and Border Protection to exclude imports produced by those means; enforcing labor provisions in the U.S.M.C.A. in collaboration with the U.S. Trade Representative. A fourth ILAB employee told me that she worried about her projects in Africa, where the bureau had funded trainings for workplace inspectors. \u201cWe think about the lives of people in other places in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the goal is also to benefit the U.S. in terms of both soft power and trade agreements.\u201d Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policies were undermining trade pacts such as the U.S.M.C.A. The same day DOGE and Chavez-DeRemer cancelled all of ILAB \u2019s grants, Trump had announced levies of twenty-five per cent on auto imports. His decision was praised by the United Auto Workers but criticized by trade economists for likely slowing down production and increasing prices. When Trump signed the U.S.M.C.A. into law, in 2020, he called it \u201cthe largest, fairest, most balanced, and modern trade agreement ever achieved,\u201d and declared an end to \u201cthe NAFTA nightmare.\u201d Many unions and labor experts agreed. Unlike NAFTA , the U.S.M.C.A. required forty to forty-five per cent of the contents of every imported vehicle to be made by workers who are paid sixteen or more dollars per hour. It was also the first trade agreement to include a \u201cRapid Response Mechanism\u201d (very fast compared with the complaint process at the World Trade Organization) through which workers, unions, or businesses could complain of unfair labor practices in Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to penalize or respond to companies who aren\u2019t following Mexican labor law, when their goods are coming into the U.S.,\u201d a fifth ILAB employee told me. The results have benefitted mining and manufacturing workers in more than thirty cases so far. In 2022, the Teksid Hierro auto-parts plant, in the state of Coahuila, a few hours\u2019 drive from the Texas border, was required to rehire and compensate three dozen employees who had been fired for organizing; the workers went on to negotiate a nine-per-cent wage increase and safety improvements. In 2023, the Goodyear rubber factory in the central Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed was mandated to hold an independent union election and pay workers $4.2 million in back wages and benefits. Higher standards in Mexico make it harder for U.S. companies to reduce wages or outsource their work. Vice-President J. D. Vance recently condemned \u201coffshoring factories to cheap-labor economies,\u201d yet the DOGE cuts could make the problem worse. \u201cFor nearly a century, the U.S. government has recognized the importance of international labor rights to American interests,\u201d a group of ILAB grantees wrote in a lawsuit filed last week. \u201cAdvocating for fair pay, safe working conditions, and organizing and bargaining rights for workers abroad helps ensure that American companies can compete on a fair playing field.\u201d The lawsuit seeks a court order mandating that Chavez-DeRemer and the D.O.L. \u201cspend money that Congress appropriated\u201d on international programs. \u201cIt seems silly to think that the U.S. is our own completely separate entity,\u201d the fifth ILAB employee said. Since Trump took office, I\u2019ve spoken to more than two dozen employees at ILAB and the rest of D.O.L. I\u2019ve also spoken to workers with regional and global expertise at U.S.A.I.D., the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Health and Human Services. As the Trump Administration moves to cancel international programs across the federal government, an idea seems to be taking shape: that it\u2019s possible to return America to a less interconnected era. Civil servants who have spent their careers managing viral pandemics or fighting enslavement in factories and mines understand that this is unrealistic. Sick people travel, as do goods tainted by forced labor. Manufacturers rely on intricate, transnational webs of production. \u201cThis idea of isolating ourselves and closing off from the world is not going to be good for our country,\u201d the fourth ILAB employee told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not good economic policy, either.\u201d Then again, certain positions that were once universal, or at least bipartisan, appear to be breaking down: the opposition to child labor, for one. The Florida legislature is currently considering a bill that would allow fourteen-year-olds to work long hours, including on overnight shifts. Governor Ron DeSantis recently endorsed child labor as a fix for worker shortages caused by mass deportations and by a new state law criminalizing undocumented immigrants. \u201cWhy do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when, you know, teen-agers used to work at these resorts?\u201d DeSantis said on a panel with Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan . \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with expecting our young people to be working part time?\u201d \u2666 The New Yorker is committed to coverage of the federal workforce.

Upgrade Now Stock market rallies after Treasury Secretary Bessent tells a closed-door investor summit that the tariff standoff with China is unsustainable U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \u00b7 Fortune \u00b7 Anna Moneymaker\u2014Getty Images Leo Schwartz Tue, Apr 22, 2025, 3:15 PM 2 min read After starting the week with a sharp selloff , stocks recovered most of their losses on Tuesday as the S&P 500 rose by 2.5%, driven by gains for blue-chip tech companies like Apple , Amazon , and Meta . The rally was triggered in part by remarks that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered at a closed-door investor summit hosted by J.P. Morgan in Washington, D.C. As first reported by Bloomberg, Bessent told the audience that he expected the tariff situation with China to de-escalate while characterizing the ongoing standoff as unsustainable. Investors eager for good news after weeks of volatility leaped at the Bloomberg report, which was published midday, with stock prices jumping after steadily creeping up throughout the morning. The faltering dollar While investors usually move out of risky assets and into the U.S. dollar during times of economic uncertainty, strengthening its price, the opposite has proved true amid President Trump\u2019s tariff war. Fears of the U.S. government\u2019s shifting policies have weakened the dollar against other fiat currencies, though the dollar stabilized on Tuesday as the market ticked back up; 61% of participants in Bank of America\u2019s most recent Global Fund Manager Survey anticipated the dollar would decline in value over the next year. That didn\u2019t stop alternative investment vehicles from continuing their rallies. Bitcoin, which supporters argue can serve as a hedge against government-backed assets, rose above $90,000 on Tuesday for the first time in more than a month, with some analysts arguing that it has decoupled from traditional equity markets. Gold, long viewed by investors as a safe haven amid volatility, briefly rose above $3,500 an ounce on Tuesday for the first time. Despite Tuesday\u2019s reprieve from the downturn, bearish signals continue to hang over the markets, including Trump\u2019s threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. In a report published on Monday, Bank of America Securities downgraded its global economic growth prediction by 0.3%, driven in part by Trump\u2019s volatile tariff plan. \u201cWe expect a significant slowdown but not a recession,\u201d the analysts wrote, putting the odds of a recession at 35%. The White House continues to push the narrative that trade deals are close to fruition with partners, including Japan and India, though the reality is likely murkier. On Tuesday, Politico reported that rather than full-fledged trade deals, any agreements will likely be sketched out as \u201cmemorandums of understanding,\u201d with negotiations continuing for months. With earnings season in full force, market choppiness is likely to continue. The Elon Musk\u2013led Tesla released its first-quarter results on Tuesday evening after its stock price had dropped nearly 15% over the past month. The company reported that its net income slid 71% in the first quarter amid competitive pressure from overseas and uncertainty around Musk\u2019s role.

Musk told Tesla investors on Tuesday that he would scale back his efforts at Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to a day or two a week starting sometime next month. \u201cStarting next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\u201d Musk said during a Tesla earnings call. But Musk defended his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that it was necessary to cut back on \u201cwaste and fraud\u201d as he urged investors to \u201clook beyond the bumps and potholes immediately ahead of us.\u201d He revealed the change after Tesla reported that its quarter fell far short of forecasts and that the escalating trade war was muddying the company\u2019s outlook for the rest of this year. While Tesla is less exposed to tariffs than most other automakers, it said it would have to revisit its guidance because of current trade disputes. \u201cIt is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,\u201d the company said. Trump slapped tariffs on auto imports on April 3 and promised to put additional ones on parts in the coming months. Tesla makes the cars it sells in the United States at American plants, so it is less exposed to tariffs on imported cars than other major automakers, but it does import parts for the cars it builds at its US factories. Musk did not specifically blame Trump for the uncertainty about trade policy, although he did try to put some distance between himself and the administration on that issue. \u201cThe tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cI will weigh in with my advice. I\u2019ve been on the record many times saying lower tariffs are a good idea for prosperity. I\u2019ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d The automaker reported its revenue fell 9%, with auto revenue falling 20%. Adjusted income tumbled 39%. Those drops were bigger than forecast. It\u2019s net income, the strictest definition of its profitability, plunged 71% compared to a year earlier. Tesla warned investors in early April that it had suffered its biggest drop in sales in its history during the first quarter, delivering 50,000 fewer vehicles compared to the first three months of last year. The sales plunge meant that Tesla recorded its lowest sales in nearly three years. The decline is stunning for a company that until recently was reporting year-over-year sales growth of between 20% and 100% virtually every quarter, which was largely responsible for its lofty stock price that made it worth more than any other automaker in the world. Musk dismisses protests Analysts in recent weeks have been laying much of the blame for the biggest sales drop in company history on Musk\u2019s controversial role in the Trump administration as the head of DOGE, which has resulted in protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities. There has also been a sharp drop in sales in Europe, where Musk has also become politically active, supporting far-right political parties in Germany and the United Kingdom. Musk claimed, without offering any proof, that those protesters were speaking out because they had been receiving the \u201cwaste and fraud\u201d that he said DOGE has been eliminating. He also defended the work of DOGE as the right thing for the country and the company. \u201cI think the right thing to do is fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the ship of America goes down, Tesla will go with it.\u201d Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 10, 2025. Shawn Thew/EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Elon Musk is the face of DOGE. But he hasn\u2019t faced a challenging interview He also acknowledged there has been criticism of the time he has spent at DOGE and not running Tesla. But he said the work setting up DOGE is \u201cmostly done\u201d so he can now step away and return to focusing on Tesla once again. Shares of Tesla ( TSLA ) climbed 4% in after-hours trading on Musk\u2019s announcement that he is stepping away from DOGE. Musk also dismissed a question about brand damage to Tesla. He blamed any drop in sales to overall economic weakness and consumer uncertainty, despite the drop occurring while sales for competing EV models and other automakers rose. \u201cAbsent from macros issues, we don\u2019t see any reduction in demand,\u201d he said. Musk also insisted that the the long-term outlook for Tesla is strong, despite the bad results in the most recent quarter. \u201cThe future of Tesla is brighter than ever,\u201d he said, adding that its problems are not nearly as serious as they have been in the past. He promised that Tesla\u2019s work on autonomous driving and humanoid robots, which have not yet lived up to Musk\u2019s past promises, would produce a period of \u201csustainable abundance for all.\u201d \u201cThis is a happy future,\u201d he promised. Demonstrators hold anti-Tesla posters during a protest encouraging people to boycott Tesla in opposition to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political efforts outside the Tesla Centre Park Royal in London, Britain. Chris J Ratcliffe/Reuters Rollercoaster ride for stock Tesla ( TSLA ) shares nearly doubled between election day and a record high in mid-December on hopes that the incoming administration would implement Tesla-friendly policies. But the stock has lost all of that post-election gain, falling 50% from its high to the close of trading Tuesday. The company reaffirmed that it still plans to come out with \u201cmore affordable models\u201d by the end of June, although its listing of capacity for its various models and plants do not sure any production of such a model the rest of this year. It also said it that its driverless \u201crobotaxi\u201d will be released by next year. The company has promised it won\u2019t have a steering wheel or accelerator or brake pedals, and that an initial service with for driverless rides will start later this spring. Tesla problems aren\u2019t all due to delayed products, trade and pushback on Musk\u2019s role in the Trump administration. It also faces increased competition from other automakers\u2019 EV offerings, including those in China. Chinese automaker BYD , for example, has pulled ahead of Tesla in EV sales for a number of quarters in recent years, including the first quarter of this year, although Tesla has always maintained the lead in full-year sales. But Tesla is poised to lose that title in 2025 given current sales trends. China is the largest market for EVs and Tesla\u2019s second largest market after the United States. The sales in China were not broken out in Tuesday\u2019s earnings report. This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.

Elon Musk, pictured in 2020, wears many hats, including as the CEO of Tesla and a senior advisor to ... More President Donald Trump. dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images Key Facts The automaker released its first-quarter results shortly after 4 p.m. EDT\u2019s market close, reporting adjusted $0.27 earnings per share and $19.3 billion revenue. Average estimates called for Tesla to report $21.3 billion in revenue and $0.41 EPS last quarter, according to FactSet. That makes Q1 2025 Tesla\u2019s worst quarter by sales since Q2 2022 and its least profitable period since Q1 2021. Revenue in Tesla\u2019s core automotive business plunged 20% year-over-year, declining to $14 billion, the weakest sum since Q3 2021. Tesla brought in $595 million of automotive regulatory credits last quarter compared to a $400 million overall operating profit, meaning Tesla was in the red to start 2025 when excluding the credits , which are all essentially free profit Tesla receives from its gas car rivals looking to comply with emission requirements. Tuesday\u2019s report follows Tesla\u2019s far weaker than expected Q1 vehicle deliveries out earlier this month which signaled its financials may also leave room for improvement, as the company delivered 337,000 vehicles during the quarter, its worst vehicle delivery growth since 2022 and coming in 17% below consensus analyst delivery forecasts. When Is Tesla\u2019s Earnings Call? The company will livestream its earnings call at 5:30 p.m. on its investor relations website . What To Watch For If Musk addresses his timeline for departing the White House during the call. Musk is a senior advisor to Trump and the head of the influential Department of Government Efficiency, having donated $288 million to Trump\u2019s 2024 election efforts. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote Sunday he expects \u201cMusk to address his role in the Trump administration\u201d on the call, and \u201cif Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla\u201d as \u201cbrand damage will grow.\u201d Tesla Stock Rebounded Ahead Of Earnings \u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman remarked in a note last month. Musk\u2019s powerful role in Washington brought a slew of controversy, culminating in boycotts of Tesla vehicles, protests and vandalism of the vehicles. JPMorgan\u2019s $120 price target for Tesla indicates the U.S.\u2019 largest bank believes shares can decline almost 50% from its $238 share price Tuesday. Tesla Stock Rebounded Ahead Of Earnings Shares of the electric and autonomous vehicle firm rose 5% Tuesday morning amid a broader market recovery, clawing back much of the Austin-based company\u2019s Monday losses . Tesla stock is still down more than 40% from its last earnings report in January. How the stock performs following Q1 results will be \u201cdictated\u201d by Tesla\u2019s ability to explain profit margins worse than Volkswagen\u2019s, confidence in progress on driverless taxi offerings and a \u201csense of increased attention from their CEO,\u201d predicted Jonas. Forbes Valuation Musk is worth $361 billion according to our latest estimates, making him by far the richest person on the planet, though he is more than $100 billion poorer than he was at his December peak.

Safety concerns and the cost of developing next-level systems have slowed down progress on autonomous vehicles - Copyright AFP FATHI NASRI Safety concerns and the cost of developing next-level systems have slowed down progress on autonomous vehicles - Copyright AFP FATHI NASRI To make autonomous vehicles work effectively and boost safety, streamlining radar and LiDAR represent a key development. Front and side radars may have different primary uses and drivers for their innovation, but together, they form a vital part of ADAS for autonomous vehicles. This is evident in IDTechEx\u2019s new report, \u201c Automotive Radar Market 2025-2045: Robotaxis & Autonomous Cars \u201c. Looking at the report, this showcases the latest radar developments and explores autonomy leveling up as a result, with Level 2+ asserting itself within the U.S. and Europe\u2019s autonomous vehicle markets. Evolving autonomy The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has established a comprehensive framework to categorize and define the different autonomous driving levels in vehicles. This framework, known as the SAE J3016 standard , classifies autonomous driving into six distinct levels, each representing a different degree of automation. Object detection in the vehicle\u2019s path The vehicle\u2019s front radar is used for object detection, which plays a role in the adaptive cruise control (ACC) and automatic emergency braking (AEB) aspects of ADAS. Enhancing front radar performance is one of the main drivers for innovation within the sector, as it plays a vital role in progressing safety technologies and the advancements of vehicle automation. Angular resolution and range are the two main focuses for these innovations, which are expected to take priority over other characteristics including field of view and packaging size. Blind spot detection and the role of side radars Side radars are mostly utilized for blind spot detection (BSD), with this feature having been dominant so far. Lane change assist (LCA) is an advanced use of BSD technology, with extra responsibility for the vehicle to ensure nothing is advancing from behind or closing in at the sides before allowing the car to be maneuvered. Cross-traffic detection (CTA), used to reverse out of a parking space, is also a vital use for side radars and gives the vehicle another layer of awareness where the driver may not be able to see. Junction pedestrian AEB is a merged application that uses the front and front side radars to scan for people on the road before the car has fully turned, showcasing different radars working together to achieve a higher level of safety. A wide field of view is more imperative for side radars than front radars to ensure the distance around the car is covered. Small packaging is also necessary to integrate the radars seamlessly into the vehicle and to fit in as many as required for optimized coverage. Long range isn\u2019t as important for side radars; 50 meters or under is likely to be sufficient for their intended uses. Level 2+ autonomy going global The report describes Level 2+ as a stepping stone between levels 2 and 3, which allows drivers to drive completely hands-free while keeping their eyes on the road and being alert and ready to take back control of the wheel. In the U.S., Tesla\u2019s \u2018Full-Self-Driving\u2019 and Ford\u2019s \u2018BlueCruise\u2019 are up and running, paving the way for other companies to start bringing out vehicles with the same technology and consolidating consumer trust in autonomous vehicles. Levels 2 to 3 Vehicles equipped with Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) can manage several driving tasks, including acceleration, braking, and steering, but still require the driver\u2019s vigilance and attention. Under Level 3 ADAS, vehicles gain the ability to manage most aspects of driving under certain conditions, allowing drivers to disengage from active control. After entering the European market in 2023, Ford\u2019s \u2018BlueCruise\u2019 technology is now operating in 15 countries. From 2025, Tesla aims to deploy fully self-driving vehicles in China, which will also encourage the uptake of Level 2+ vehicles. The maintained supervision accompanying level 2+ may be why it is currently presenting as more favorable than level 3. The benefits of autonomous vehicles and their appealing futuristic qualities can be experienced with an added layer of security, which also may help OEMs with liability in the event of a collision. 4D radars and future developments 4D and imaging radars will be necessary for advancing systems because of the elevation resolution it brings as well as Azimuth resolution, which can adjust the car\u2019s planning and adaptivity. This technology will more easily enable the development of level 3 and level 4 going forward, as the vehicle will have more detailed information of what is being detected, and what the necessary action is.

We are updating this post with all the details from the financial results, shareholders\u2019 letter, and the conference call later tonight. Refresh for the latest information. Tesla Q1 2025 earnings expectations As we reported in our Tesla Q1 2025 earnings preview yesterday, the Wall Street consensus for this quarter was $21.345 billion in revenue and earnings of $0.41 per share . The expectations had been significantly downgraded over the last month, as analysts were surprised by Tesla\u2019s announcement of much lower deliveries than expected in the first quarter. Advertisement - scroll for more content Did Tesla meet them? Tesla Q1 2025 financial results After the market closed today, Tesla released its financial results for the first quarter and confirmed that it missed expectations with earnings of $0.27 per share (non-GAAP), and it also missed revenue expectations with $19.335 billion during the last quarter. This is a big miss for Tesla despite the company admitting to selling a lot more regulatory credits this quarter. At $595 million in credit sales, Tesla would have lost money without it in Q1 2025: Top comment by ModernMarvalFan Liked by 27 people I think Q2 will be worse. Cybertruck recall cost will be impacted in Q2. Tariff cost are mostly in Q2. Combined with more sales drop and potential economic down turns, the Q2 drop may be even greater.

Image: Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Umar Shakir is a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge. Nissan\u2019s next-generation GT-R is expected to launch by the end of the decade, and it\u2019s not going to be a pure EV. The new R36 GT-R that will succeed the aging R35 will have a plug-in hybrid powertrain and launch in three to five years, according to Nissan\u2019s chief planning officer, Ponz Pandikuthira, speaking to The Drive . Although it sounds like Nissan is already developing the GT-R in-house, Pandikuthira also hints to The Drive that the company may work with Honda to share a platform with a new Acura NSX. Pandikuthira has dropped a lot of theoreticals about the GT-R. He teases that it could house the 2025 Nissan Armada\u2019s twin-turbo V6 engine, but also drive 70 miles or so on battery only for around-town errands. Pandikuthira also told The Drive that Nissan had built GT-R EV prototypes but believes an electric version \u201cwould complete one lap at the N\u00fcrburgring\u201d before needing a recharge, echoing the same concern he had in a 2024 interview with Motor Authority . At the time, Pandikuthira said they had not yet decided what powertrain they would use. Other EVs like the Tesla Model S Plaid have run at least three laps on the N\u00fcrburgring on a single charge. Additionally, Pandikuthira mentioned that Nissan\u2019s in-development solid-state battery technology probably wouldn\u2019t work for the R36 GT-R. \u201cIt might be alright for other electric cars that you could do that are the cruising around need to be seen at a country club, but the ultimate raw performance GT-R as an electric car, that\u2019s really quite a ways away,\u201d Pandikuthira told The Drive . As noted by Jalopnik , it would be tough to hit a deadline for the GT-R by 2030, considering a possible collaboration with Honda could take a while. It raises questions whether Pandikuthira\u2019s comments on the GT-R are aspirational, or if there\u2019s something much further along that has yet to be shared.

( Supplied: Pacific Green Australia ) In short: Investment in large-scale battery storage is on the rise. The projects store up renewable energy generated during the day that can be used during peak periods. What's next? A researcher says a change in federal energy policy could unnerve investors. abc.net.au/news/big-battery-storage-key-to-renewable-energy-transition-australia/105074602 Link copied Share Share article A surge in investment in large batteries is helping to safeguard Australia's energy future but experts say the trend could be threatened by a change in policy. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being committed to dozens of battery projects aimed at capturing renewable energy that can be used during off-peak periods when wind and solar power is not being generated. Among the projects is Pacific Green's Limestone Coast North Energy Park in South Australia. The Limestone Coast park will have a capacity of 1,500MWh when completed. ( Supplied: Pacific Green Australia ) Once the neighbouring Limestone Coast West project is completed, the site will be the largest battery energy storage facility in the state. It is expected to have a capacity of 1,500 megawatt hours, which Pacific Green says will be enough to store up to 60 per cent of the SA's residential solar output. Over the border in Victoria, the construction of the larger four-stage Portland Energy Park is expected to begin in early 2026 and several other projects are in the early stages of development. Pacific Green Australia managing director Joel Alexander. ( Supplied: Pacific Green ) Pacific Green Australia managing director Joel Alexander said the pipeline of batteries had strengthened as the cost of the technology decreased. \"The benefits can be ultimately passed on to consumers through lower volatility in the market and therefore lower retail prices,\" he said. Battery projects other than Pacific Green's are planned for the National Electricity Market and south-west Western Australia's Wholesale Energy Market. The 'easiest' approach Australia was an early adopter of battery storage with projects such as SA's Hornsdale Power Reserve \u2013 also known as the \"Tesla battery\" \u2013 but Scott Dwyer from the University of Technology Sydney said the technology had rapidly developed in other countries. Scott Dwyer says a change in energy policy could unnerve investors in renewables. ( ABC News: Jack Ailwood ) \"Australia will still be attractive for developers, particularly as they're trying to ease the process and make it easier to connect to these big projects,\" he said. \" Every week you're hearing more and more projects being announced, being commissioned and developments starting. \" Asma Aziz is a senior lecturer in power engineering at Edith Cowan University. ( Supplied ) Edith Cowan University senior lecturer Asma Aziz said that in the past big batteries could only run for about two hours but higher capacity systems were now becoming common. \"If we are looking at a reliable system we need to look at more long-duration storage systems, like four or eight hours,\" she said. Dr Aziz said battery storage was the \"right, and easiest, approach for Australia\" and noted that American states were already having success with a similar model. \"We're seeing from a US perspective how they have been using it and we're seeing success from California and Texas,\" she said. \"That's what we're trying to replicate here in Australia.\" Battery projects are being installed across the country. ( ABC News: Keane Bourke ) Uncertainty for investors Last month Pacific Green closed the sale of the Limestone Coast North project to Intera Renewables for $460 million. Simon Parbery, the executive director of Palisade Investment Partners, the majority owner of Intera, said the purchase would provide \"sustainable long-term returns\" for investors while supporting decarbonisation. Dr Dwyer said battery parks provided \"attractive, stable revenues\" for companies. \"They can be difficult to develop as well, so some of these parks are almost built, ready for these investors to come along,\" he said. The energy park proposed for Portland, Victoria, would cover 30 hectares. ( Supplied: Pacific Green Australia ) Energy policy is a key point of difference between the major parties and Dr Dwyer said a shift away from renewables could unnerve investors following the federal election in May. \"It would cast some doubt over Australia's transition to net zero mostly through renewable energy projects,\" he said. \"But [the Coalition's] nuclear projects are probably not going to be developed for decades and, once you've got all the development agreements, [batteries] are pretty quick to build and energise. \" Whether those nuclear plants come to fruition or whether battery projects step in and make the nuclear argument redundant, it adds a bit of uncertainty. \" This big battery project in Kwinana, WA, sits alongside a coal-fired power plant that is being dismantled. ( ABC News: Clint Jasper ) Key part of energy future Dr Dwyer said big batteries were not the only solution to Australia's energy issues, but would play a significant role in the future. \"Australia's got a massive challenge, like the rest of the world, to decarbonise its economy,\" he said. \"Not to be forgotten, though, is the role of smaller-scale distributed storage. \"We've got 300,000 to 400,000 residential battery systems \u2026 we're also seeing businesses and communities looking at small-scale battery storage.\" Dr Aziz said Australia would have to find other energy sources such as pumped hydro or nuclear in the future. \"But right now I think we're on the right track through renewable energy and batteries,\" she said.

Jamell Harris loads raw casting heads to be manufactured at the Stellantis Dundee Engine Complex on August 18, 2022 in Dundee, Michigan. Bill Pugliano | Getty Images DETROIT \u2013 Six of the top policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are uncharacteristically joining forces to lobby the Trump administration against 25% tariffs on auto parts that are set to take effect by May 3. The group \u2013 representing franchised dealers, suppliers and nearly all major automakers \u2013 say in a letter to Trump administration officials that the upcoming levies could jeopardize U.S. automotive production. The letter notes many auto suppliers are already \"in distress\" and wouldn't be able to afford the additional cost increases, leading to broader industry problems. \"Most auto suppliers are not capitalized for an abrupt tariff induced disruption. Many are already in distress and will face production stoppages, layoffs and bankruptcy,\" the letter reads. \"It only takes the failure of one supplier to lead to a shutdown of an automaker's production line. When this happens, as it did during the pandemic, all suppliers are impacted, and workers will lose their jobs.\" The letter, dated April 21, is addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. It is signed by the heads of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, American International Automobile Dealers Association, Autos Drive America, vehicle suppliers association MEMA, National Automobile Dealers Association, and American Automotive Policy Council. The joint letter is uncharacteristic, if not unprecedented, for the automotive industry. Such organizations rarely, if ever, sign on to a single joint message. The groups say they represent the country's No. 1 manufacturing sector that supports 10 million American jobs in all 50 states and pumps $1.2 trillion into the economy every year. Automakers not represented by the groups include electric vehicle makers Tesla , Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group . \"President Trump has indicated an openness to reconsidering the administration's 25 percent tariffs on imported automotive parts \u2013 similar to the tariff relief recently approved for consumer electronics and semiconductors. That would be a positive development and welcome relief,\" the letter reads. The letter comes a week after President Donald Trump said he may \"help\" some auto companies that need more time to move or increase U.S. vehicle production. \"I'm looking for something to help some of the car companies, where they're switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places, and they need a little bit of time because they're going to make them here,\" Trump said April 14. \"But they need a little bit of time, so I'm talking about things like that.\" Auto executives and experts have told CNBC Trump's tariffs are more dire for auto suppliers than the automakers themselves. The impact could cause a ripple effect through the global supply chain, they say. Auto officials are expecting a drop in vehicle sales amounting to millions of units, higher new and used vehicle prices, and increased costs of more than $100 billion across the industry, according to research reports from Wall Street and automotive analysts. \"We support more manufacturing and additional supply chains that run through the United States, but it is not possible to reroute global supply chains overnight or even in months. This will take time,\" reads the letter.", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/auto-groups-lobby-trump-administration-against-parts-tariffs.html", "source": "CNBC", "published_at": "2025-04-22T20:00:37"}, {"id": 2833, "title": "Tesla earnings updates: Investors seek details on brand damage, lower-cost model - Business Insider", "content": "Tesla earnings updates: Investors seek details on brand damage, lower-cost model - Business Insider - Slashdot Slashdot is powered by your submissions , so send in your scoop Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

The Model Y even became Europe's best-selling car back in 2023, giving weird nerds something to point to when you asked why the company was worth nearly as much as every other automaker put together . Now, though, the tide is turning for Tesla. Its CEO is no longer seen as an engineering whiz using his ideas for the good of mankind, but instead as a political hatchet man tasked with fundamentally altering the federal government of the United States. Tesla sales, too, are circling the drain. Now, according to new-vehicle registration data out of Europe , the entire Tesla fleet is losing out to Volkswagen's EVs. Tesla falls as Volkswagen rises Jure Divich/Shutterstock Tesla's sales in Europe slid 38% in the first quarter of 2025, according to analyst firm JATO , placing the brand beneath a surging Volkswagen for BEV registrations. Tesla moved 53,237 units in Q1, while Volkswagen sold 65,679 electric vehicles during the same period \u2014 a 157% increase from its BEV sales for the same period last year. The Model Y remains the best-selling EV, but it's far from the best-selling car. In fact, it's not even in the top 10. Tesla did take Volkswagen in EV sales for the month of March, but the numbers \u2014 27,828 for Tesla and 25,544 for Volkswagen \u2014 mark a decline for Tesla and a massive increase for VW. If those trends continue, Tesla could easily be overtaken by third-place seller BMW. Tesla and Volkswagen are still neck and neck for EV sales, but even being in that position is a massive blow to Tesla ahead of its earnings call tonight. A sales slump is likely already priced in to the stock, but this trend \u2014 losing out to Volkswagen and facing competition from BMW \u2014 cats a dark shadow over the company's future. Whether it's due to Tesla's aging lineup, or people's general reaction to the CEO's politics , one thing looks clear: Musk has played stupid games with his car company, and is now winning stupid prizes. h/t Motor1 Comment(s) Recommended", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.jalopnik.com/1841278/tesla-losing-to-volkwagen-ev-europe-sales/", "source": "Jalopnik", "published_at": "2025-04-22T19:52:11"}, {"id": 2835, "title": "State Treasurers Call on Tesla Board to Ensure Musk\u2019s Focus on Company", "content": "State Treasurers Call on Tesla Board to Ensure Musk\u2019s Focus on Company | Chief Investment Officer Home > News > Market Moves > State Treasurers Call on Tesla Board to Ensure Musk\u2019s Focus on Company Several state treasurers, from states that collectively invest hundreds of billions of dollars of public pension assets, have informed the board of Tesla Inc. that they are concerned about the performance of Tesla\u2019s stock, as well as where Tesla CEO Elon Musk is focusing his attention. The April 17 letter , signed by seven state treasurers and the controller of California and presented by Americans for Responsible Growth, an advocacy group focused on ensuring responsible fiscal stewardship, asked the board of Tesla to \u201cact decisively to ensure the company returns to a stable and focused trajectory.\u201d Tesla shares are down nearly 40% so far this year. The company, which Tuesday evening announced that company profits fell 71% in the first quarter of 2025, has grappled with a decline in deliveries and increased competition in China from upstart automakers like BYD and Xiaomi. Tesla reported Q1 2025 revenue of $19.34 billion, below the $21.3 billion it reported a year ago. \u201cTesla, Inc. is not just one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies\u2014it is a major player in the clean energy economy and a leading force in emerging technologies such as robotics and autonomous driving,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cThe company\u2019s success or setbacks have significant implications for workers, regional industries, and innovation ecosystems in our states.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news. \uf061 The signatories were also concerned with Musk\u2019s divided attention across his multiple companies, including X, XAI, SpaceX and Neuralink, as well as his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency service temporary organization. \u201cThese external commitments raise serious questions about whether Tesla\u2019s leadership is fully engaged in addressing the company\u2019s core challenges,\u201d the letter stated. Musk\u2019s position at DOGE and closeness with the administration of President Donald Trump has drawn criticism from investors and fiduciaries. \u201cThe Board\u2019s role is especially critical now\u2014to provide strong oversight, uphold fiduciary standards, and ensure that the company\u2019s leadership is aligned with the long-term best interests of the company,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cPublic officials like us do not take the step of raising these concerns lightly except when the obvious risks demand it.\u201d The letter called for the Tesla board to provide clarity on the following questions: How is the board ensuring that Musk and Tesla\u2019s leadership team are devoting adequate time and focus to resolving recent performance issues and guiding the company\u2019s future direction? In light of the company\u2019s underperformance, how is the board evaluating whether executive compensation remains aligned with shareholder value and corporate accountability? and How does the board plan to communicate its strategy for navigating this period of uncertainty and restoring investor and public confidence in Tesla\u2019s leadership? \u201cFinally, we strongly believe Tesla\u2019s board would benefit from engaging with public sector stakeholders who share an interest in the company\u2019s long-term value and societal impact,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to speak further about these concerns and discuss how the board can take swift and transparent action to restore investor confidence and public trust in Tesla\u2019s leadership and the company\u2019s future.\u201d Several institutional investors have criticized Tesla\u2019s governance and Musk\u2019s political ventures at DOGE. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander earlier this month called for the city\u2019s law department to pursue securities litigation against Tesla over what he identified as the board\u2019s failure to properly oversee Musk. \u201cEver since Elon Musk took over DOGE and became best-friend-in-chief with President Trump, Tesla\u2014where Musk is supposed to be CEO\u2014has suffered financially, causing enormous losses for Tesla shareholders,\u201d Lander said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cIn less than three months, Tesla stock has lost nearly 40% of its value, with losses over $300 million for the New York City pension systems.\u201d Danish pension fund AkademikerPension in March announced plans to sell its remaining shares of Tesla and add the company to its exclusion list if major changes were not made. In early April, the Canadian Association of Professional Employees, one of the largest public sector unions in Canada, called on the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, as well as all Canadian pension funds, to divest from their Tesla holdings. Signatories of the ARG letter, in the order listed, included: Washington State Treasurer Mike Pellicciotti (signing the letter solely in his official as a state treasurer); Massachusetts State Treasurer and Receiver-General Deborah Goldberg; Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs; Connecticut Treasurer Erick Russell; New Mexico State Treasurer Laura Montoya; Colorado State Treasurer David Young (signing the letter as an elected official and not as a fiduciary); Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak; and California State Controller Malia M.

The S&P 500 gained 2.9% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.3%, reversing losses from the prior session. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The rebound followed a Bloomberg report citing unnamed sources that said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had described the ongoing trade war as \"unsustainable\" during a meeting with investors. Bessent also suggested that an agreement with China was possible, according to the report. Shares of companies closely tied to China, including Nvidia ( NVDA , Financials ) and Tesla ( TSLA , Financials ), jumped 6% each after the news. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD , Financials ) also recovered earlier losses, rising more than 1%. The gains helped recover ground lost during Monday's sell-off, when the Dow fell more than 970 points and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined over 2%. Since President Donald Trump announced a round of tariffs on imported goods on April 2, the S&P 500 had been down more than 6% prior to Tuesday's rebound. As of 1:53 p.m. EDT, the S&P 500 was quoted at 5,237.25, up 79.05 points, or 1.53%. Investors remain cautious following Trump's recent criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Truth Social. Trump referred to Powell as Mr. Too Late and a major loser and suggested last week that the White House was studying options for his removal. Powell has stated he intends to serve his term through May 2026, maintaining that he cannot legally be dismissed by the president. Portfolio manager Jed Ellerbroek of Argent Capital Management said the prolonged uncertainty was weighing on market sentiment. \"The longer we remain in this limbo, the worse it gets for the economy,\" Ellerbroek said. Despite Tuesday's rally, concerns about trade relations, monetary policy independence, and economic growth continue to loom over the market. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

Cybercriminals lure creators into downloading malware-laced files disguised as promotional content. Malvertising - ads for fake AI tools or games like GTA VI - that install info-stealers and remote access trojans on victims\u2019 devices are also common tactics. Events that draw large online audiences, such as Apple keynotes, the XRP-SEC lawsuit, or CS2 tournaments, are frequently exploited. Attackers use these moments of peak interest to launch scams disguised as official livestreams or contests. For instance, during the 2025 White House Crypto Summit, fake YouTube streams promoted fraudulent airdrops to trick viewers into surrendering sensitive information or cryptocurrency. How to stay safe To stay safe, creators are urged to use the best browsers with built-in security features, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and closely monitor account activity for suspicious changes. Scrutinizing unexpected sponsorship offers, especially those tied to trending topics, is also essential. It\u2019s recommended to implement the best DDoS protection to guard against service disruptions following account takeovers, and to use a reliable proxy service to add a layer of anonymity and security when managing accounts across platforms. Bitdefender also advises creators to train team members on current threats and to stay updated through official security bulletins from platforms and cybersecurity researchers. Tools like Bitdefender Security for Creators offer dedicated protection, including 24/7 account monitoring, scam email filters, and guided recovery options in the event of a breach.

(Credit: FNTV) Climate change vandals spray-painted a Tesla car dealership in Manhattan on Tuesday to protest Elon Musk\u2019s work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but as police arrived, the activists could be seen cleaning off some of the vulgar writing. The showroom is the latest Tesla location to be targeted by anti-Musk and anti-DOGE protesters since the billionaire CEO of the company began leading the cost-cutting agency. The incident also coincides with Earth Day, an annual event aimed at protecting the environment. Video shows two maskless men scrawling \"F\u2014k DOGE\" and \"We do not consent\" on the store\u2019s windows with fluorescent red and green spray paint. KAROLINE LEAVITT CONDEMNS \u2018DANGEROUS' ATTACKS ON TESLA: \u2018DOMESTIC TERRORISM\u2019 A Tesla car dealership in New York City was spray-painted by climate change activists on Tuesday to protest Elon Musk\u2019s work with DOGE. (FNTV) Several DOGE signs were also coated onto several windows with red lines crossing through each of them \u2013 similar to a \"no\" or \"prohibited\" symbol. The showroom is located in Manhattan\u2019s Meat Packing District, between Washington Street and W 13th Street, and people could be seen inside at the time. The group appeared to belong to the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion, which has been known to overtake public spaces, cause disruptions and deface public buildings. The group claims to use non-violent civil disobedience to protest against political inaction over what they believe is man-made climate change. The two climate vandals were arrested when police arrived on the scene. The younger man was wearing a pink t-shirt with the words \"Climate Change = Mass Murder\" inscribed on the back of his top. Police inspect the damage at the Tesla showroom in Manhattan. (FNTV) Asked why he was being arrested, the man said: \"Because people do not consent to unelected fascists and this is Earth Day.\" The group\u2019s New York City chapter boasted about the defacing of the building on X. Extinction Rebellion also took credit for spray-painting Wall Street\u2019s iconic Raging Bull on Tuesday. WALZ STAFFER ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING TESLAS MIGHT NOT FACE CHARGES: REPORT Dozens of reported attacks on Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have taken place this year. The incidents range from minor vandalism, such as keying or graffiti, to more extreme cases like arson and drive-by shootings allegedly targeting Tesla vehicles. Several federal lawsuits pertaining to these Tesla attacks have been filed . Elon Musk's decision to lead DOGE has led to the targeting of Tesla car dealerships because of his role with the Trump administration. (Musk, BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images, Getty. ) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Attorney General Pamela Bondi has said the Department of Justice is treating such incidents as \"domestic terrorism.\" Some of the more serious attacks on Tesla in the U.S. include a March 18 incident in Las Vegas when police said 36-year-old Paul Hyon Kim used a Molotov cocktail to torch several Teslas at a local dealership. Four Tesla Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Seattle Tesla lot last month, while two Tesla Cybertrucks caught fire at a local dealership in Kansas City.

Take that from Becky Navarro of Austin, Texas, who says she found herself stuck in the middle of an express loop when her self-driving Waymo taxi decided it needed a break. After stopping, the vehicle seemed to offer no way for Navarro and her passengers to leave, effectively trapping the group on an active highway as cars whipped past. Navarro, who detailed her wild ride on TikTok , said the incident started when the Waymo went haywire, whisking the group off in the opposite direction they needed to go. Luckily, Waymo riders can contact live customer support for incidents that happen during their ride. Unfortunately, the remote agent didn't do much \u2014 and by the sound of it, couldn't have even if he wanted to. Once customer service was called, Navarro says the car stopped in the middle of a lane under MoPac \u2014 an infamous toll-loop running along the west side of Austin. MoPac is frequently listed among the most dangerous highways in the city, and is so notorious it spawned its own viral parody account on X-formerly-Twitter, Evil Mopac . \"So then we're talking to customer support,\" Navarro explains, \"we kept saying, 'hey we're on the highway, please, like move the car.' Cars kept honking at us and it would not move, would not let us out.\" Video from within the Waymo shows the group arguing with a live support agent as a screen prompts riders to \"please exit now,\" all while an autonomous voice continuously chimes \"vehicle approaching\" at each passing car. \"I understand, but we don't have a way to just physically move the cars,\" the agent stammers as the women ask to leave. Though Waymo's user guide has no advice on how to exit its vehicles in an emergency, some social media users suggest that pulling the door handle twice is the key to exiting in situations like these. Whether Navarro and her friends were truly locked in or just unaware of the exit mechanism is unknown. To the agent's credit, exiting onto a high-speed MoPac ramp isn't exactly the safest option, though it does pose the question of why the Waymo parked itself there in the first place. And from a practical standpoint, why is trapping riders inside the only option when Waymo's self-driving cars go haywire? Earlier this year, a man experienced a similar incident when a Waymo car began driving in endless circles around a parking lot in Phoenix, Arizona. \"I've got my seatbelt on, I can't get out of the car,\" the driver said from the backseat of the Waymo. \"Has this been hacked?\" Given the glitchy state of self-driving tech \u2014 and the life or death stakes involved \u2014 you wouldn't be nuts for wondering why these things are allowed on roads at all. As far back as 2011, state governments have been slashing red tape to allow companies to \" live test \" self-driving cars on public roads, a move often used to court high-value tech companies to open operations in states like Nevada and Arizona . Under the Trump administration, the already fractured regulatory landscape is poised to relax even further , meaning profit-seeking companies like Waymo, Uber, and Tesla will be given even more power to fill our streets with error-prone cars like the ones Navarro experienced in Austin. That regulatory handover has consequences. Autonomous vehicles have already clocked 617 crashes in the US, 21 percent of which occurred with something other than a car \u2014 meaning cyclists, pedestrians, and objects on the side of the road. Between May and September of 2022 alone, self-driving cars racked up a whopping 11 fatalities . Contrast this to a country with strong automotive regulation like China, which imposed strict controls over self-driving advertising and software after an autonomous vehicle accident killed three college students in 2024. Given the current state of things, it's clearly time to pump the brakes on self-driving cars, even if that means further delaying shareholder profit . After all, you can't put a price on human lives.

And not for all the right reasons. Tesla has taken many hits this year as its CEO Elon Musk leans further into right-wing politics and oversees DOGE , the advisory body that President Trump has bestowed the power to slash federal spending. For Tesla, that has meant watching both its stock price and global sales plummet. And that\u2019s not even taking into account pressure from competitors in China, Europe, and North America. As Tesla bull and Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note this morning, Tesla is facing the lowest margin expectations this quarter in 12 years. How Tesla\u2019s stock performs will be reliant on the company\u2019s ability to explain why its profit margins are worse than Volkswagen\u2019s amid \u201clikely cash burn,\u201d instill confidence in its autonomy plans, and wrangle Musk\u2019s attention away from the White House. Analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance are expecting revenue of around $21.41 billion, which would be flat year-over-year and down from $25.7 billion in Q4 2024. Tesla\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call is at 2:30 p.m. PT / 5:30 p.m. ET. The public can listen along to the call by tuning in here , here , or on X. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll be listening for. Updated EV sales guidance During Tesla\u2019s last earnings call , the company said it expects its vehicle business to \u201creturn to growth in 2025.\u201d Will that still be the case, given Tesla\u2019s unimpressive delivery numbers for Q1 and weak customer demand driven in part by Musk\u2019s politics? Tesla recorded 336,681 deliveries in the first three months of the year, its worst quarterly performance in more than two years. The automaker does have some tailwinds. It is better positioned than other OEMs to weather Trump\u2019s tariff storm due to its domestic sourcing and high degree of vertical integration. That said, Musk\u2019s proximity to Trump probably doesn\u2019t help his popularity in China, one of Tesla\u2019s biggest markets. That dynamic could drive more customers into the open arms of rival BYD. Any mention of the cheap EV Sources at Tesla have told us that the company has all but abandoned its plans for a cheap EV , though others have reported the automaker has merely delayed the car\u2019s rollout by months. Either way, we\u2019ll be listening out for updates there. Robotaxi rollout During Tesla\u2019s full-year 2024 earnings call, Musk said the company would launch a paid ride-hailing robotaxi service in Austin starting this June. He has said in the past that Tesla would first use Model Y and Model 3 vehicles with \u201cunsupervised\u201d FSD, rather than its two-seater Cybercab concept that\u2019s built without a steering wheel or pedals. As research analysts at Cantor said: \u201cTesla has not yet quantified the commercialization of its Robotaxi segment, or disclosed initial routes/territory.\u201d So investors and analysts will be on the lookout for more concrete details of Tesla\u2019s Austin plans. The automaker has also said that it plans to launch in California this year, but has been mum on those details. Cybercab production We\u2019re also hoping to hear some updates on Tesla\u2019s Cybercab . Federal regulations don\u2019t currently allow for operators to mass produce and deploy autonomous vehicles without human controls built-in without an exemption. Musk will likely bend that regulation to his will, as he is wont to do, so we might get some insights later into when Tesla plans to start production on those futuristic-looking vehicles. Optimus updates In Q4, Musk said he expected Tesla to start using Optimus humanoid robots internally this year, particularly for the \u201cboring\u201d tasks. We\u2019ll be listening for a timeline for that, as well as when Tesla says it will begin high volume production of Optimus, and when it expects to begin initial deliveries. Dojo or Cortex Musk and Tesla have been quiet on Dojo since August 2024, a surprise given how gung ho they were about the supercomputer that would help the company achieve its full self-driving dreams. Then there\u2019s Cortex, which is Tesla\u2019s other new giant AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to help solve real-world AI. In Tesla\u2019s Q4 shareholder deck , the company shared updates on Cortex, but nothing on Dojo. The latest update we\u2019ve seen show some kind of computing cluster came from the Tesla AI X account with the words, \u201cQuiet please. The machines are learning.\u201d Though it\u2019s not clear if it\u2019s Dojo or Cortex. The reprioritization of Elon Per Jonas\u2019s note, investors will be searching for \u201cany signs of Tesla\u2019s CEO reprioritizing the efforts of Tesla versus politically oriented endeavors.\u201d Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and other Tesla bull, said in a note Sunday that Musk is facing a \u201cCode Red Situation.\u201d He reiterated his previous stance that Musk needs to distance himself from DOGE so that the Tesla brand ceases to be a political talking point.

President Donald Trump waves before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House ... More on March 7. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Key Facts State Department: Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced plans to reorganize an agency he said is \u201cbloated, bureaucratic, and unable to perform its essential diplomatic mission,\u201d reducing U.S. staff by 15% and closing more than 100 bureaus worldwide, the Associated Press reported , citing State Department documents it obtained. Environmental Protection Agency: The EPA notified about 280 employees working on environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives they would be fired or reassigned, The Washington Post reported , part of an effort to close the EPA\u2019s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, which had placed 171 of its employees on administrative leave then reinstated dozens working in regional offices less than a month later, according to a previous Washington Post report. Health and Human Services: HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in March he would cut 10,000 jobs\u2014in addition to 10,000 employees who took an earlier layoff package\u2014affecting about 15% of the workforce in a reorganization that includes cutting 18% of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6% of National Institutes of Health workers and 4% of employees at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Department of Defense : The Pentagon aims to cut about 60,000 civilian employees, multiple outlets reported in March, after the agency said in February it aimed to cut 5% to 8% of its civilian staff (about 21,000 had reportedly already taken voluntary resignations). Department of Education : The agency announced on March 11 it would begin the process for laying off half of its workers, about 2,000 employees, ahead of Trump\u2019s March 20 executive order aimed at effectively shuttering the department. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: The agency is expected to lay off a total of about 2,000 employees, or 20% of its workforce, multiple outlets reported in mid-March, prompting fears it would affect the agency\u2019s weather forecasting work ahead of hurricane season and other potential natural disasters. Central Intelligence Agency: The agency started to fire some probationary employees in March, multiple outlets reported, after firing some diversity staffers in February who had been placed on leave as part of the Trump administration\u2019s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government. Department of Veterans Affairs : The VA plans to cut more than 80,000 workers beginning in June in an attempt to return to 2019 staffing levels, its chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, said in an internal memo, Reuters reported on March 5. Internal Revenue Service : The IRS was preparing to reduce its nearly 100,000-person workforce by about 50% through layoffs and buyouts, multiple outlets reported in early March, with a reduction of 20% of staff by May 15, CNN reported March 13 \u2014after the Trump administration already laid off about 7,000 IRS workers and reportedly set out to close more than 110 offices in February, at the peak of tax season. U.S. Agency for International Development: Thousands of employees were reportedly given 15-minute windows on Feb. 27 and 28 to clear their office spaces as the Trump administration dismantles the agency and places its foreign aid-distribution responsibilities under the state department, ultimately aiming to reduce staff to 15. Social Security Administration: The agency plans to cut its staff by about 7,000 employees, or 12%, according to multiple reports last month. Labor Department: The agency plans to reduce staff in an office that handles equal employment opportunity laws by 90%, The Washington Post reported in February, though it\u2019s unclear how many employees will be affected. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: The agency\u2014which has open safety investigations into Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla company\u2014laid off 4% of its staff, a spokesman said in a statement that said the agency grew by 30% during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, noting it \u201cretained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes.\u201d Federal Emergency Management Agency: The Trump administration directed senior officials in the FEMA resilience office, which helps communities prepare for potential disasters and mitigate risk, to identify employees who work or worked on \u201cclimate, environmental justice, equity and DEIA\u201d initiatives for potential firings, CNN reported in February, citing an email sent to resilience office officials that said the directive could \u201cimpact the majority\u201d of staff, as Trump suggested previously he wants to eliminate FEMA entirely and DOGE is conducting a review of FEMA operations. TSA: More than 240 employees were fired in February \u201cdue to performance and conduct issues during their probationary period,\u201d TSA spokesperson Robert Langston told Bloomberg \u2014the outlet added it\u2019s not unusual for probationary TSA workers to be terminated due to performance, and the Office of Personnel Management notes it\u2019s \u201cless cumbersome\u201d to fire federal staff during the probationary period soon after they\u2019re hired. Office of Community Planning and Development: The Trump administration is aiming to cut the office, an arm of the department of Housing and Urban Development, from 936 staffers to 150, or 84%, the New York Times reported Feb. 20, citing a document it obtained detailing the plans. Health agencies : Some 5,200 probationary employees across the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were targeted for layoffs, multiple outlets reported in February, with Bloomberg reporting that employees at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration were also laid off. Department of Energy : As many as 2,000 probationary employees at the agency have been fired, Politico reported in February, citing anonymous sources\u2014though Bloomberg reported some department staff who work on nuclear security were asked back. U.S. Forest Service : More than 3,400 employees have been fired, two people familiar with the firings told Politico in February. Small Business Administration : Some probationary employees at the agency received emails notifying them of their terminations, before another email said the initial notices were a mistake, only to be notified in a third email days later confirming their firings, Bloomberg reported in February. Office of Personnel Management : Probationary employees at the office who did not take the Trump administration\u2019s buyout offer were let go in early February, a union official with the American Federation of Government Employees told NPR . Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : The union that represents workers at the financial agency said about 73 of its members had been terminated, after the agency\u2014which has drawn ire from Trump\u2019s tech allies\u2014was ordered to stop all work, though union leaders and the Trump administration reached a deal in mid-February to prevent more agency employees from being terminated while litigation challenging the dismantling of the agency is pending. National Nuclear Safety Administration : An employee at the agency\u2014which oversees nuclear weapons in the U.S.\u2014told NPR in February the agency would fire about 300 of the agency\u2019s 1,800 staff, though the Trump administration reportedly rehired some.

What To Watch For The Supreme Court on April 8 halted a lower court ruling ordering the Trump administration to rehire nearly 17,000 probationary workers across six agencies who were terminated in February. In a second case, an appeals court on April 9 also paused a Maryland judge\u2019s ruling ordering 18 agencies to rehire 25,000 terminated probationary workers Who\u2019s Making The Cuts? The significant staff cuts across the federal government have been largely attributed to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, as part of its broader mission to root out purported government waste. In a Cabinet meeting March 6, Trump reportedly told agency heads they ultimately have authority over firings, rather than Musk\u2014a move that could help the Trump administration fight lawsuits over DOGE\u2019s authority. Trump suggested following the meeting that Musk would still have some control, however, telling reporters that if agency heads \u201ccan cut, it\u2019s better, and if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u201d In court, the Trump administration has sought to distance Musk from the terminations, describing his role as \u201cadvisory.\u201d What Other Officials Have Been Fired By Trump? It\u2019s not immediately clear how many staff have been affected by widespread layoffs across the Trump administration, which are separate from voluntary buyout deals offered to more than 2 million federal workers. Trump\u2019s administration has reportedly made a number of other high-profile terminations: At least 17 inspectors general, the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency plus three other FEMA workers, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on cases against Trump, multiple senior FBI officials, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, and several high-ranking military officials, including Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown. Who Are Probationary Employees? Mostly new employees who have been in the federal workforce for less than a year and are not afforded some job protections, including a right to appeal terminations. Probationary employees are the target of the Trump administration\u2019s layoffs, according to multiple reports. More than 200,000 federal workers are probationary employees. How Many Employees Have Resigned Since Trump Took Office? The Trump administration separately offered all federal civilian workers pay with benefits through September if they choose to voluntarily resign, an offer 75,000 federal workers reportedly accepted. The administration has suggested employees who don\u2019t participate in the program could be subject to the mass terminations. What Are The Rules For Mass Layoffs At The Federal Government? Federal regulations of mass layoffs, known as \u201creduction in force,\u201d require the government to give 60 days advance notice of a layoff. The job must also be eliminated entirely\u2014not an attempt to replace a worker, according to the Wall Street Journal . Employees who believe the administration broke protocol in terminating them can file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board. There are also protections in place for independent boards and commissions, such as the NLRB. Presidents can only fire members of the board for \u201cmalfeasance\u201d or \u201cneglect of duty,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. What Other Cuts Are Expected? Trump is aiming for budget cuts between 30% and 40%, on average, across all government agencies, with staffing reductions serving as a major area for spending rollbacks, the Washington Post reported in mid-February, citing two anonymous sources. How Does Trump Want To Use Schedule F To Terminate Employees? Trump signed an executive order to reinstate a policy from his first term that reclassified tens of thousands of federal civilian employees to at-will employees, making it easier for him to fire them by ridding them of their job protections. Several unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union have filed lawsuits to block Schedule F from taking effect. Schedule F is unrelated to the mass layoffs of probationary employees, but is widely viewed as another tool Trump can use to exert outsized power over the makeup of the federal workforce. What Have Republicans Said About The Terminations? Some Republicans have spoken out about the widespread job cuts, with Musk\u2019s controversial email to federal employees asking them to detail five accomplishments sparking some of the sharpest criticism. Multiple Republicans called for Musk to exercise more \u201ccompassion\u201d in his effort to reduce the federal workforce in the wake of the email. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, called the email \u201cabsurd\u201d and likened the directive to \u201cintimidation,\u201d while others expressed concerns that Congress doesn\u2019t have enough information about DOGE\u2019s activities. Musk met with Republicans in March and reportedly attempted to downplay his role in the terminations, insisting they were at the discretion of agency leaders, CNN reported . The White House has also said repeatedly Musk is not in charge of DOGE and is instead a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d who is not paid and acts in an advisory capacity.

Analysts, including Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, have voiced worries that Musk\u2019s leadership focus has splintered. Since accepting his controversial role in the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has faced protests and backlash that analysts say may be affecting the brand.

A recent CNBC ( CMCSA ) All-America Economic Survey found that 47% of Americans now hold a negative view of Tesla, indicating significant potential challenges for the brand\u2019s image. Shares rose about 5% Tuesday amid a pre-earnings and larger market bounce.

Earnings per share are projected at $0.42, a 6% drop year-over-year, as price cuts continue to weigh on margins. Advertisement Tesla has spent much of the past year slashing sticker prices to protect volume, but that strategy is now butting up against profitability constraints. Several firms have already slashed full-year guidance, citing mounting pressure on fundamentals and the capital demands of next-gen vehicle and autonomy bets. Deliveries drop as brand heat cools Global vehicle deliveries fell to 336,681 units in Q1, down 13% year-over-year and Tesla\u2019s lowest total in nearly three years. The slowdown reflects both fierce competition \u2014 from Rivian ( RIVN ) and from China\u2019s BYD ( BYDDY ) \u2014 and downtime linked to Model Y retooling. Advertisement \u201cThe stumbling sales during the first quarter indicate that the one-time leading brand is reeling from the fallout of the company delaying launches for years, and Musk\u2019s foray into politics in the United States and Europe,\u201d Reuters ( TRI ) reported . In California, Tesla\u2019s largest U.S. market, registrations dropped 15.1% last quarter. And since Musk accepted a role in the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Tesla stock has fallen week after week \u2014 a rare streak even for this historically volatile name. Advertisement DOGE\u2019s damage As of April 2025, DOGE, led by Musk, has been linked to over 275,000 federal job cuts, encompassing layoffs, buyouts, and eliminations \u2014 amounting to approximately 12% of the 2.4 million civilian federal workforce. These actions have sparked lawsuits, protests, and growing concerns about weakened oversight and public services. Advertisement There\u2019s nothing neutral about the world\u2019s richest man laying off tens of thousands of middle-class workers. The political backlash is bleeding into Tesla\u2019s brand, with potential implications for demand and regulatory goodwill. Product delays keep piling up Investors are still waiting for clear updates on two cornerstone projects: Tesla\u2019s long-promised affordable EV and its autonomous robotaxi fleet. Both initiatives have faced repeated delays, and with rivals moving faster on AI, battery tech , and production scale, Tesla\u2019s early-mover edge may be starting to dull. Advertisement Tariffs tighten the squeeze Fresh U.S. tariffs on imported auto parts may add to Tesla\u2019s margin stress, despite the company\u2019s localization efforts. Even Musk admitted the impact is \u201cnot trivial.\u201d Advertisement High stakes for earnings With Q1 numbers landing in just hours, Tesla enters a high-stakes stretch. The company must address a dense tangle of problems \u2014 slowing growth, margin compression, political fallout, and product delays \u2014 if it hopes to stabilize the narrative. \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://qz.com/tesla-q1-earnings-report-elon-musk-tsla-byd-rivn-1851777337", "source": "Quartz India", "published_at": "2025-04-22T19:12:00"}, {"id": 2737, "title": "Tesla Rival Rivian Taps AI Expert Aidan Gomez To Drive Innovation", "content": "Tesla Rival Rivian Taps AI Expert Aidan Gomez To Drive Innovation Why did Tesla profits plunge this quarter?

If Musk goes bye-bye, can his minions sojourn on? Photo: Jamie Kelter Davis/Bloomberg/Getty Images This has been one of Washington\u2019s favorite games lately: When will Elon leave? The planted axiom is that Elon Musk \u2019s bizarre and wildly destructive adventures as head of the shambolically established Department of Government Efficiency can\u2019t last long, for multiple reasons. First, his far-flung corporate empire could use more of his attention, and his extracurricular activities haven\u2019t exactly helped his bottom line (notably at Tesla, where public reaction to DOGE\u2019s antics severely damaged the once-cool brand ). Second, it\u2019s assumed that infinitely large egos like Musk\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s (not to mention the other highly self-regarding MAGA veterans in the Trump Cabinet) cannot perpetually coexist in the same public and private space for very long, particularly since there are elements of the Trump 2.0 agenda, like his trade war , that may not enchant the chief bankroller of the 47th president\u2019s 2024 campaign. Third, the incredible yet deliberately induced chaos that has been DOGE\u2019s signature contribution to public administration must soon give way to some sort of sustainable operating model for delivering benefits and services. And fourth, Musk\u2019s own lagging popularity (punctuated by the defeat of a Republican judicial candidate in Wisconsin whom Musk had bankrolled and personally campaigned for) isn\u2019t helping the Boss\u2019s own gradually eroding job-approval numbers. But assuming Musk\u2019s days at the helm of DOGE are numbered (his original appointment as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d expires next month , and the entire DOGE operation is supposed to wrap up in July of next year), can his minions sojourn on without him? There\u2019s no particular reason to assume they cannot. DOGE employees are now routinely \u201cembedded\u201d in federal agencies, typically at the very peak of the administrative pyramid and with top-shelf access to the all-important data. They are typically working hand-in-glove with Trump political appointees who share their deep hostility to agency missions and to career civil servants. In many parts of the federal bureaucracy, the mid-level managers that might push back against DOGE demolition efforts are already gone or are so terrified of losing their jobs that they do exactly what DOGE staffers tell them to do. They no longer need much adult supervision. Perhaps just as importantly, there is a powerful permanent institution in the Trump administration that shares DOGE\u2019s hatred of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and is much better equipped to manage a gradual transition from slash-and-burn cuts in spending and personnel to a regularized if downsized bureaucracy devoted to the administration\u2019s policy goals. That would be the Office of Management and Budget and its director, Project 2025 co-author and Christian nationalist zealot Russell Vought . Vought formed an alliance with Musk shortly after the 2024 election, when DOGE was just an evil glimmer in the Tech Bro\u2019s eye, based on their shared vision of a vast purge of the bureaucracy to root out non-MAGA influences and blow up programs and policies that did not serve the reactionary cultural and economic agenda of Trump 2.0. And the deeply experienced OMB director has almost certainly played a key role behind the scenes in coordinating DOGE\u2019s raids on federal agencies with OMB\u2019s plans and harmonizing both with what the administration is demanding from its congressional allies. Vought is the \u201cglue guy,\u201d to use a sports metaphor, who keeps the team together. And his authority will likely expand if Musk leaves Washington, as Bloomberg\u2019s Max Chafkin explained earlier this week: A Trump administration official, who requested anonymity to share internal discussions, says Vought is widely perceived as preparing to pick up wherever Musk leaves off. Where Musk has shown a zeal for smash and grab, Vought has the institutional knowledge\u2014and perhaps the patience\u2014to make the DOGE cuts stick. Vought, this person says, \u201cis waiting in the wings.\u201d Unlike Musk, Vought knows the federal government\u2019s many nooks and crannies like the back of his hand and is perfectly positioned to deploy Musk\u2019s orphaned raiders in a much more coordinated campaign to take DOGE and its hollowed-out agency hosts to the next level (or, in the eyes of their victims, the next level of hell). They don\u2019t need their turbulent creator around with his attention-grabbing habits and over-the-top cartoon-villain malevolence. Vought\u2019s dull knife will cut even deeper than Musk\u2019s chain saw, and a lot less noisily.

More manufactured electric vehicles throughout Southern California. Tesla is a multinational automotive and energy company headquartered in Austin, Texas. getty As the market continues to rollercoaster, Tesla (TSLA) would likely love to get off the ride. The company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, and its stock is down 38% year-to-date (YTD) and 48% from its 52-week high. The near halving in stock price might have investors wondering, is now the time to scoop up shares on the cheap? No. And, I show below, I do not see an honest argument for owning the stock above $50/share. Tesla lost its first-mover advantage, its profitability and market share are in decline, and there\u2019s no straight-faced argument that the company can reverse these trends. I have reached out to Tesla for comment and will update this post if I receive a reply. The clear-eyed math that drives my Tesla research leads me to the inescapable conclusion that TSLA is worth less than $50/share or 80%+ below the current price. Yes, there are staunch believers in CEO Elon Musk\u2019s ability to change the world. But, math is math. And, the numbers in this report paint a very clear picture. Sell TSLA now. Whether you think Tesla is just a car company, or a combination of robot, solar, battery, insurance, FSD, space exploration, and satellite companies, its stock is terribly overpriced. For starters, Tesla\u2019s current stock price implies that the company will become the world\u2019s largest automaker, not just electric vehicle maker, even as the company is losing market share, seeing revenues flatten, and continually misses its delivery goals. In this report, I address the many reasons why Tesla does not (and hasn\u2019t ever) deserve its lofty valuation. Reason #1: First Move Advantage Will Last Forever MORE FOR YOU Do Not Make Calls On Your Phone If You Get This Message U.S. Futures And Asian Markets Rise After Trump Suggests China Tariffs Will \u2018Come Down Substantially\u2019 NYT Mini Crossword Today: Hints, Clues, Answers For Wednesday, April 23 Market Share Is Declining Rapidly. Tesla\u2019s total vehicle deliveries fell YoY for the first time in 2024, and despite rising deliveries prior to 2024, the company has not been keeping pace with the overall EV market. Based on sales data from the International Energy Agency, Tesla\u2019s share of global EV sales, which include battery-electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), fell from 17% in 2019 to 10% in 2024. For comparison, BYD\u2019s share of the global EV sales, including BEV and PHEV, increased from 10% in 2019 to 22% in 2024, which makes BYD the global leader in EV sales. Wuling had the third highest market share at 4%, and the rest of the main competitors (BMW, Li Auto, Geely, Volkswagen, and more) followed close behind at market shares ranging between 3% and 2%. As a battery-electric vehicle manufacturer only, I can also compare Tesla\u2019s share of the BEV industry. Per Figure 1, Tesla\u2019s BEV market share, based on number of vehicles sold, fell from 25% in 2019 to 17% in 2024. Figure 1: Tesla\u2019s Share of Global BEV Sales: 2019 \u2013 2024 TSLA Market Share 2019-2024 New Constructs, LLC Market Share Losses Are Steepest in the More Mature EV Markets. Tesla has been ceding the most share in more mature EV markets, as multiple competitors (old and new) bring numerous, compelling new models to market. China is the largest EV market in the world with 64% of global EV sales in 2024. BYD is #1 in China by a wide margin. Its sales were 32% of the EV market, while Tesla was just 6% in 2024. Tesla is not even in second place in China. According to Autovista24, BYD\u2019s EV sales were 5.2x higher than the second-best EV brand Wuling, and 5.3x higher than Tesla\u2019s EV sales in China in 2024. I expect BYD to widen its lead on Tesla as it rolls out new charging technologies and a wider range of EV models to meet many different price points. Figure 2: Best-Selling EV Brands in China in 2024 TSLA China Market Share 2024 New Constructs, LLC Tesla\u2019s market share in Europe is trending down, too. Tesla\u2019s European sales declined 45% in the first two months of 2025, despite overall EV sales in the region rising 37% over the same time. Tesla\u2019s market share in Europe fell from 21% in 1Q23 to 9% in 1Q25 according to EU-EVs.com. Volkswagen leads the market with 14% share in 1Q25. See Figure 3. On a monthly basis through February 2025, Tesla\u2019s sales in Europe fell YoY in 10 of the last 12 months. Figure 3: Europe BEV Market Share: 1Q23 \u00ad\u2013 1Q25 TSLA EU Market Share 1Q23-1Q25 New Constructs, LLC In the U.S. Tesla still enjoys leading market share. However, I\u2019m not sure how long that will last given that its market share fell from 82% in the first half of 2020 to 44% in 1Q25. Around the world, the market share trend is not Tesla\u2019s friend. As I stated long ago, competition would erode Tesla\u2019s once-leading market share. While Tesla is counting on its redesigned Model Y to boost sales, I think that goal looks less and less likely to be met due to production pauses at factories around the world. Can\u2019t Regain Market Share with Delivery Misses Piling Up. Not only is Tesla losing market share, but it is increasingly missing consensus estimates for vehicle deliveries. Tesla\u2019s deliveries in the first quarter of 2025 missed the consensus estimate by 12% or 40,909 deliveries, which was one of the largest misses to date. Longer-term, Tesla has missed the consensus estimates for deliveries in 7 out of the last 10 quarters per Figure 4. Such misses add further evidence to Tesla\u2019s ongoing struggles. Figure 4: Tesla\u2019s Quarterly Delivery Beats & Misses: 4Q22 \u00ad\u2013 1Q25 TSLA Delivery Misses 4Q22-1Q25 New Constructs, LLC Reason #2: Profits to the Moon Profits Are Headed Down . No doubt, Tesla deserves credit for proving the EV market, but that doesn\u2019t mean EVs are a good business. Tesla briefly boasted high margins and soaring sales, but as inevitably happens in free markets, a flood of competition has forced revenue growth and margins down. Tesla saw impressive revenue growth for many years, but that trend has stopped in its tracks. Total revenues, excluding automotive regulatory credits, were down ever-so-slightly from $95 billion in 2023 to $94.9 billion in 2024, while automotive revenue, the large majority of the business (more on that topic below), excluding regulatory credits dropped more precipitously (8%) from $80.6 billion in 2023 to $74.3 billion in 2024. Worse yet, Tesla\u2019s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) fell 39% from $7.2 billion to $4.4 billion over the same time. See Figure 5. Tesla\u2019s NOPAT margin fell from 13% in 2022 to 5% in 2024, while the company\u2019s invested capital turns fell from 2.3 to 1.6 over the same time. Falling NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive Tesla\u2019s ROIC from 30% in 2022 to just 8% in 2024. Figure 5: Tesla\u2019s Revenue and NOPAT: 2022 \u2013 2024 TSLA Nopat & Revenue 2022-2024 New Constructs, LLC Tesla\u2019s declining profitability is a window into the competitive dynamics of the EV industry. When Tesla faced less competition, it earned high margins. As companies entered the market, pricing became more competitive, and consumers had greater choice in EVs, Tesla\u2019s profitability declined. For example, Tesla\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) was nearly 4 times higher than the average ROIC of its incumbent peers in 2022. Incumbent peers under coverage include Toyota (TM), General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), Honda (HMC), and Nissan (NSANY). However, in 2024, Tesla\u2019s 8% ROIC is equal to the average trailing twelve-month (\u201cTTM\u201d) ROIC of its incumbent peers. Still Burning Cash Like There\u2019s No Tomorrow. Surprise! Despite showing positive EPS and even a decent ROIC, Tesla has been a major money loser over its life. It doesn\u2019t qualify as a Zombie Stock, due to its large cash balance (Musk is really good at selling stock), but it continues to burn cash at a zombie-like pace. Tesla\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) has been positive in just one year out of the last 14 years. Since 2014, Tesla has burned $29.0 billion, excluding acquisitions. In the last three years alone, the company burned through $10.2 billion. Figure 6: Tesla\u2019s Free Cash Flow: 2014 \u2013 2024 TSLA FCF 2014-2024 New Constructs, LLC If Tesla could not sustain positive cash flows in the good times, I\u2019m not sure how it ever will, considering the declines in market share, technological advantage and profits. Reason #3: Technological Advantages Will Last Forever No More Range Advantage. Tesla once boasted a large range advantage in the EV market, particularly at a time when consumers weren\u2019t sure about the feasibility of EVs as replacement to ICE. That advantage has all but disappeared. In 2014, Tesla owned the #1 and #2 longest-range EVs in the world and had a big lead of the next closest competitor. Specifically, at #1, the 85 kW-hr version of Model S reported a range of 265 miles, and, at #2, the 60 kW-hr version of Model S reported a range of 208 miles. The next closest vehicle, the BYD e6, reported a range of just 127 miles. With such a big lead over the competition, I can understand why investors might believe Tesla would retain its range advantage for the foreseeable future. Fast-forward to 2025, and the range discussion looks a lot different. Car And Driver tested many popular EVs to determine a real-world range, rather than the range reported in marketing materials. Through this testing, Car and Driver found that four vehicles have longer \u201creal-world\u201d ranges than Tesla\u2019s Model S. See Figure 7. Figure 7: Highest Range EV Models in 2025 \u2013 Top 5 TSLA _EV range comaprison New Constructs, LLC As you move lower down the list, the differences in range get less significant. For example, the Rivian R1T, which ranked 14 th in Car and Driver\u2019s testing, had a range of 280 miles, or just 40 miles less than Tesla\u2019s #5-ranked Model S. In other words, Tesla has fallen behind in range and more firms are catching up to it. Lagging Behind in Charging Speed. The time it takes to charge an EV is one of the main pain points that make consumers hesitant to purchase an EV. After all, it only takes a few minutes to put gas in a vehicle and be on your way. If EV charging takes 30+ minutes, it\u2019s not be as an attractive alternative. China\u2019s BYD, the world\u2019s largest EV maker in 2024, recently unveiled new chargers that could erase this concern altogether. BYD\u2019s new 1,000 kW chargers can add almost 250 miles of range to an EV in just 5 minutes. Tesla\u2019s most powerful charging stations can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes; so the new BYD charging stations are almost 4 times as fast and make charging time the same as filling up a regular gas car, maybe even faster. BYD aims to install 500 of these new chargers in April Tesla is \u201cplanning\u201d to roll out 500 kW chargers this year, though these charging stations appear to be just half as powerful as BYD\u2019s new chargers. Autonomous Driving Technology Is Stagnating. Tesla bulls have long maintained the company\u2019s autonomous driving technology, Full Self Driving (FSD), will be best-in-class. The company has marketed that its FSD technology will allow all its vehicles to drive autonomously and create a massive robo-taxi ride hailing service that would instantly convert Tesla vehicles into money-making machines that work while their owners sleep. However, real world data would show that Tesla\u2019s latest FSD, v13, is nowhere close to being fully autonomous. ~3 months after v13 was released, data shows the system can go, on average, 495 miles between critical disengagement. Previously, Tesla has stated that it needs to achieve 700,000 miles between critical disengagement to be safer than humans. While Tesla is struggling to improve its FSD technology, Waymo, a robotaxi company that is now a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL), already has 700+ fully autonomous cars on the road that provide 200,000 rides a week. And, these cars are not just fully autonomous for arguments sake, they actually have no humans behind the wheel. According to Guidehouse Insights, Tesla ranks dead last out of the top 20 competitors in autonomous driving technology. The top three companies in the autonomous driving technology race are Waymo, Baidu, and Mobileye. The top 10 are below: Waymo Baidu Mobileye Nvidia Aurora Plus WeRide Zoox Gatik Cruise As noted in Electrek, Elon Musk has promised unsupervised FSD \u201cby the end of the year\u201d in each of the last six years. Tesla keeps promising, but not delivering. Robotaxis Must Pass Many Legal Hurdles. Even if the technology was more competitive, Tesla must secure a series of approvals from several state regulators to put robotaxis on the road. The company has received only the first approval (of many required) for operation in California. Given the issues detailed in the sections before and after this one, I do not think Tesla will have much success in securing the approvals needed to put its robotaxis, in their current state, on the road. Safety Issues Present Huge Risk to the Stock. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) continues investigations into Tesla\u2019s FSD and autopilot features. Most recently, NHTSA opened a safety probe for up to 2.6 million Tesla vehicles in January 2025. Since 2019, Tesla\u2019s automated driving features have been linked to over 700 hundred crashes and at least 19 deaths. Tesla\u2019s largest ever recall happened at the end of 2023, where the company was forced to recall 2 million vehicles to fix the software related to its Autosteer driver assist feature. If the NHTSA discovers defects in Autopilot or FSD, Tesla could be on the hook to fund the expenses of a massive recall not to mention the liabilities related to the deaths and injuries from the crashes. Furthermore, any design flaws discovered in the investigation could leave Tesla open to more class action litigation. Competitors Are Better Equipped to Improve Technology. As Telsa\u2019s vehicles fall behind in range, charging speed, and autonomous driving, incumbent auto manufacturers continue to outspend the company in research and development (R&D). Per Figure 8, Tesla\u2019s R&D spend in 2024 ranks far behind the likes of Ford (F), Toyota (TM), General Motors (GM), Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen. As has long been the case and a key point in my bear thesis on Tesla, one of the most overlooked advantages for incumbent manufacturers is their profit-generating legacy operations that can fund larger R&D budgets. While Tesla must continue to simultaneously develop new technology and add production capacity from scratch, incumbents can leverage cash flows from existing profitable operations to build new technologies and leverage existing distribution advantages to sell more EVs, if and when the market is ready. Figure 8: Tesla\u2019s R&D Spend Vs. Major Competitors in 2024 TSLA R&D Spending vs Competition 2024 New Constructs, LLC How could one expect Tesla to regain its first-mover advantages when it is falling behind and its R&D budget is so much lower than its competition? And, given the major drop in profits and consistently negative free cash flow, I see no reason to believe Tesla will ever have competitive R&D budgets. Reason #4: Tesla Is Not a Car Company, Should Be Valued based on Other Businesses Other Businesses Aren\u2019t Material. Bulls have long argued that Tesla is not just an automaker, but it\u2019s a technology company with multiple verticals including insurance, solar power, space exploration (Mars anyone?), full self-driving, robotaxis, and, yes, robots. I\u2019ve long refuted these pipe dreams. Regardless of the promises of developing multiple non-auto businesses, Tesla\u2019s revenues remain heavily concentrated in automobiles. After a steep decline in 2024, auto revenue was 79% of Tesla\u2019s total revenue. In 2023, auto revenue was 85% of total revenue. Energy generation and storage accounted for just 10% of total revenue in 2024. The rest of the company\u2019s revenue comes from the \u201cservices and other\u201d segment, which includes insurance, non-warranty maintenance and collision, sales of used vehicles, and retail merchandise sales. Figure 9: Tesla\u2019s Segment Revenues as a Percentage of Total Revenue in 2024 TSLA Revenue By Segment 2024 New Constructs, LLC Energy Generation and Storage\u2026 Solar Power Segment Is Still Weak. Tesla\u2019s energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. As of the first half of 2024, 8 of the top 10, including all of the top 5, solar panel manufacturers were Chinese companies. I don\u2019t think Tesla has any competitive advantages in the solar power space. It is hard to believe that Tesla will be able to take material market share from the dominant Chinese manufacturers. Services and Other Services and other revenue consist of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales. Insurance Business Is a Nothing Burger . Elon Musk once claimed that the insurance could be 30-40% of the value of Telsa\u2019s car business. Today, it\u2019s so small its bundled within the services and other segment. In 2024, Tesla\u2019s insurance operations generated upward of $1 billion (~1% of revenue) in premiums while accumulated at least $69 million in underwriting losses. Robots Are Way Behind the Competition . At its \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event in October 2024, the company showcased its autonomous Optimus robots walking around, dancing, mixing drinks, and talking. Sounds impressive. However, the robots were actually controlled remotely by humans, which does not seem so groundbreaking after all. Tesla\u2019s remote-controlled robots are multiple generations behind the industry leaders, and I do not see reason to expect that to change anytime soon. For example, Boston Dynamics\u2019 humanoid Atlas robot is already fully autonomous and requires no remote controls or pre scripted movements. This video from October 2024 shows Atlas successfully moving engine covers between supplier containers and a mobile sequencing dolly after being provided with only a \u201clist of bin locations to move parts between\u201d. Atlas showcases dynamic movements as well as fully autonomous operational capabilities. Boston Dynamics\u2019 Spot robot can fully navigate its way through factory floors, construction sites, research labs, etc. while also monitoring and collecting data. Spot can do all the mentioned functions either by remote control or autonomously following a predefined route. Boston Dynamics is one of many companies that are way ahead of Tesla in the development of robots. Cybertruck Is Losing Money. Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck hit the market with lots of fanfare. Mr. Musk was able to secure more than a million reservations to buy the vehicle before one ever hit the road. It quickly became the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. However, this demand quickly stalled when consumers actually saw what they were getting. Now, Tesla is struggling to sell its inventory. U.S. Cybertruck sales fell over 32% between January and February 2025. Cox Automotive estimates that Tesla sold around half the number of Cybertrucks in February 2025 than its best ever month, September 2024. Estimates put Tesla\u2019s inventory of new Cybertrucks at ~2,300 in early April. One would expect with over one million reservations, Tesla would be delivering Cybertrucks as fast as they could build them, not holding increasing numbers in inventory. In the latest hit to the pent-up demand bull thesis, Tesla is reportedly trying to boost sales by converting its more expensive foundation series trucks to the base model (which costs $20,000 less), by having the special badging buffed off. Early on, Mr. Musk said the Cybertruck might generate positive cash flow within a few years, once volumes reached certain levels. It appears those volumes have not and will not ever be met. Other Businesses Are More Liabilities Than Assets . Musk has his hand in many pies outside of Tesla, and some of them appear to be very promising businesses. However, it is important to note that these businesses are not part of Tesla, and they do not contribute to the profits or losses of Tesla. Many would argue that these other businesses, such as Neuralink, SpaceX, Starlink, xAI, Boring, DOGE, and more do more to hurt Tesla because they take Mr. Musk\u2019s valuable attention away from Tesla. Or worse, they compete directly with Tesla not just for Musk\u2019s attention but also the attention of key Tesla personnel. For example, in June of 2024, Tesla shareholders sued Musk for a breach of fiduciary duties based on comments he made about poaching Tesla employees for the xAI and using Tesla resources for his private companies. The lawsuit remains unresolved. However, it stands as one of many examples where Musk\u2019s interests are not aligned with those of Tesla shareholders. No matter how talented a CEO might be, if he or she engages in self-dealing on the regular at the expense of the company he/she runs, I raise a big red flag. Reason #5: Tesla\u2019s Stock Valuation Makes Sense Despite the challenges above, Tesla\u2019s stock is still priced for extraordinary profit growth, while incumbents are priced for the exact opposite. While Tesla\u2019s market cap is more than double the combined market cap of incumbents, the company\u2019s economic book value (EBV), or no growth value, is -$11 billion. Meanwhile, each of the other legacy automakers has an EBV that is higher than its current market cap. In other words, the price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of Tesla\u2019s competitors ranges from 0.2 to 0.6. In each of these instances, a below 1.0 PEBV ratio implies the market expects profits for these legacy automakers to permanently decline. See Figure 10. Figure 10: Tesla\u2019s Valuation Compared to Incumbent Peers*: TTM TSLA Peers Market Cap and PEBV 4-16-25 New Constructs, LLC *As of market close on April 15, 2025. Current Valuation Implies Tesla Will Own 31%+ of the Global EV Market Tesla selling 1.8 million cars in 2024 is no small feat. However, that number is minuscule compared to the 22 million to 38 million vehicles [depending on average selling price (ASP) assumptions] that Tesla must sell to justify its very expensive stock price. For reference, Toyota, the world\u2019s largest overall (EVs and everything) automaker for the fifth straight year, sold 10.8 million vehicles in 2024. Does anyone believe, after what I covered above, that Tesla will ever sell twice as many cars as Toyota? To provide the details behind this implied vehicle sales analysis, I show my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model \u2019s output so investors can decide for themselves whether or not Tesla\u2019s valuation is too high. Quantifying The Expectations in the Current Share Price. To justify ~$250/share, my model shows Tesla would need to: immediately achieve a 15% net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margin (1.5x Toyota\u2019s TTM margin, compared to Tesla\u2019s 2024 margin of 5%) and grow revenue by 28% compounded annually through 2035. In this scenario, Tesla would generate $1.4 trillion in revenue in 2035, which is 1.3x the combined TTM revenues of Toyota, General Motors, Nissan (NSANY), Ford, Honda Motor Corp (HMC), and Stellantis (STLA). In this scenario, Tesla would generate $204.5 billion in net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) in 2035. At $204.5 billion, Tesla\u2019s NOPAT would be 3.1x all incumbent peers\u2019 combined TTM NOPAT and 1.9x Apple\u2019s (AAPL) TTM NOPAT, which, at $109 billion, is the highest of all companies my firm covers. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s ROIC would rise to 331% (nearly 4x Apple\u2019s TTM ROIC of 81%) in 2035. If I assume automotive revenue remains 79% of total revenue as in 2024, then Tesla would generate $1.1 trillion in automotive revenue in 2035 in this scenario. This revenue figure implies Tesla will sell the following number of vehicles based on these ASP levels: 22.4 million vehicles \u2013 ASP of $50k (equal to average new-vehicle price in Dec 2024) 25.9 million vehicles \u2013 Tesla\u2019s 2024 ASP of $43k 38.2 million vehicles \u2013 ASP of $29k (equal to Toyota in fiscal 2024) Next, I can analyze implied market share of such sales volume based on the estimated number of new EV sales in 2035, according to data compiled by Autovista24. In this scenario, the vehicle sales noted above would represent the following implied market share in 2035: 31% for 22.4 million vehicles 36% for 25.9 million vehicles 53% for 38.2 million vehicles The likelihood of reaching any of the above-mentioned market share scenarios is extremely unlikely in such a competitive industry. For reference Toyota, the world\u2019s largest automaker, held an 11% share of the global automobile market in 2024. Figure 11: Tesla\u2019s Implied Vehicle Sales in 2035 to Justify $252/Share TSLA Implied Market Share in 2035 New Constructs, LLC TSLA Has 65%+ Downside Even If the Company is the World\u2019s Largest Automaker If I instead assume, Tesla\u2019s: NOPAT margin immediately improves to 10% (equal to Toyota\u2019s TTM NOPAT margin), revenue grows at consensus estimates in 2025 (11%) and 2026 (19%), and revenue grows 22% each year thereafter from 2027 to 2035, then my model shows the stock would be worth just $87/share today \u2013 65% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Tesla\u2019s NOPAT would still grow to $72.8 billion, which is 16x Tesla\u2019s 2024 NOPAT. At its current ASP, assuming automotive revenue remains 79% of revenue, this scenario implies Tesla will sell 13.8 million vehicles in 2035 at an ASP of $43k, or 19% of the projected global EV market in 2035. 13.8 million vehicles is more nearly 30% higher than the 10.8 million vehicles sold by Toyota, the world\u2019s largest overall automaker, in 2024. TSLA Has 81%+ Even If Tesla Grows Sales Volume by Over 4x If I estimate more reasonable (but still very optimistic) market share achievements for Tesla, the stock is worth just $49/share. Here\u2019s the math, assuming Tesla\u2019s: NOPAT margin immediately improves to 10%, revenue grows at consensus estimates in 2025 (11%) and 2026 (19%), and revenue grows 14% compounded annually from 2027 to 2035, then my model shows the stock would be worth just $49/share today \u2013 an 81% downside to the current price. In this scenario, assuming automotive revenue remains 79% of revenue, Tesla would sell 7.5 million cars (10% of the projected EV market in 2035) in 2035 at an ASP of $43k. Given the required expansion of plant/manufacturing capabilities and formidable competition, I think Tesla will be lucky to sustain a margin as high as 10% from 2025-2035. If Tesla fails to meet these expectations, then the stock is worth less than $49/share. Figure 12 compares the firm\u2019s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in the above scenarios to illustrate just how high the expectations baked into Tesla\u2019s stock price remain. For additional context, I show Apple\u2019s, Toyota\u2019s, and the combined incumbent peers\u2019 TTM NOPAT. Figure 12: Tesla\u2019s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios TSLA DCF Implied NOPAT Scenarios New Constructs, LLC Each of the above scenarios assume Tesla grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Tesla\u2019s invested capital has grown 29% compounded annually since 2014. If I assume Tesla\u2019s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger.

And many investors are expecting a \" messy \" rollercoaster ride. The EV maker has seen its stock price fluctuate wildly amid president Donald Trump's tariff war, and is currently down over 37 percent year to date. Sales have dropped off a cliff worldwide, with longtime Tesla megainvestor and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives warning that CEO Elon Musk has created a \" code red \" situation for the once-ascendant company. Musk has spearheaded the Trump administration's massive slashing of government budgets with the help of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. His actions there, as well as his increasingly public and extremist views , have proven devastating for Tesla's brand. Just two months ago, Ives raised his Tesla price target to a lofty $550 , predicting a \"golden era\" for Musk with Trump in the White House. At the time, he expected that Tesla could see its market cap reach $2 trillion by the end of this year, arguing that the incoming Trump administration could be a \"total game changer\" for Tesla's self-driving and AI ventures. Instead, Tesla stock price is down to a dismal $237 per share, with its market cap at just $740 billion \u2014 and investors are clearly concerned that, if Musk can't undo all the damage he's inflicted, it could fall much further. Ives also predicted \"very solid\" delivery demand for the company's vehicles, which has instead cratered this quarter, even falling behind rival BYD as resale value for the besmirched vehicles falls as well . Then, as bad news added up, he cut his target by a whopping 43 percent , saying that Musk's disastrous political scheming was driving the brand into the ground. Ives also remains concerned the mercurial CEO has given up on the carmaker, considering the sheer amount of time he's been spending in Washington, DC. \"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives argued in a Sunday note to clients . \"Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia.\" \"You will think differently after those discussions,\" he added. In the run-up to the company's earnings call, Tesla's share price has been volatile, sinking over six percent on Monday only to recover the lost ground by midday Tuesday. And plenty of questions remain about the company's future. Musk has bet Tesla's fate on self-driving tech and the launch of a \" Cybercab\" robotaxi that's supposed to be revealed this summer. However, investors have been far more concerned about the company refreshing its conventional lineup, which hasn't seen a major overhaul in quite some time now. So far, we've only heard rumors of a purportedly cheaper mass-market vehicle that's based on the company's popular Model Y SUV. Given the grim outlook, Ives slashed his price target two weeks ago , pointing out concerns over Tesla getting caught up in Trump's trade war against China. While the EV maker has a strong manufacturing presence in the US, it isn't immune to the president's steep tariffs aimed at the world power. The longtime Tesla bull predicted tough days ahead for the carmaker. \"We view this as a fork in the road time,\" Ives added, borrowing an expression Musk used to encourage federal government employees to resign. \"If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO.\" However, \"if Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow,\" Ives argued.

Shares of major crypto companies like Strategy and Coinbase rose 8%- 9%, while several crypto miners, such as Bitdeer, CleanSpark, MARA Holdings, and Riot Platforms, posted double-digit gains. Despite today's bounce, U.S. mining operations face challenges from tariffs and potentially slowing growth. Crypto-related stocks surged on Tuesday, riding the momentum of a broader crypto rally that has reignited risk appetite across digital assets with bitcoin (BTC) crossing above $90,000. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) were up 8% to 9% during the session. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Leading the move higher were bitcoin miners, with many of them posting double-digit gains, outpacing BTC's 5% advance. Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR) rallied some 20%, while Bitfarms (BITF), CleanSpark (CLSK), Cipher Mining (CIFR), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Riot Platforms (RIOT) soared between 10% and 15% during the session. Meanwhile, the broader stock market also rebounded from yesterday's decline , with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 up 2% and 1.7%, respectively. The rally in the TradFi market came as reports of potential de-escalation of U.S.-China tariff tension lifted investor sentiment. Miners and tariff risks The bounce in mining stocks comes after months of underperformance, weighed down by compressed margins, rising hashrate competition, and tariff-induced difficulties, all of which are combined with broader market weakness for risk assets. Most, if not all, publicly traded miners are still trading near multi-month lows. At issue for U.S.-based mining operations is the Trump administration's tariff policy, which threatens to make ASICs (the machines used to mine bitcoin) much more expensive to import. That means that mining operations in the U.S. will probably grow at a much slower rate or even stop growing altogether. The tariffs \u201cwill materially affect future spending and CapEx in the U.S.,\u201d Taras Kulyk, co-founder and CEO of mining hardware provider Synteq Digital, told CoinDesk recently. \u201cOther jurisdictions that had previously looked higher cost [will] become sought after targets for new infra and capex deployment. Canada in particular, will likely be a benefactor to the implementation of the global tariff regime that\u2019s been put in place by the White House.\u201d Relatedly, one of the reasons behind Bitdeer\u2019s outperformance may be because the company is developing its own ASIC manufacturing business and recently took the decision to build out its self-mining capacities instead of selling its rigs in a slower market. Stablecoin giant Tether has also been on a buying spree of BTDR shares; as of last Thursday, the company had invested $32 million in Bitdeer. Even so, most miner stocks have been on the downtrend since December, long before the White House unveiled its new tariff policy. Now, with BTC climbing above key technical levels and liquidity flowing back into the space, miners are probably catching a bid as a leveraged proxy for BTC's upside. Regardless of the outperformance today, tariffs will continue to play a key role in miners and most crypto-related stocks, along with other risk assets. With earnings season starting soon, all eyes will be on comments from CEOs about how the tariff situation will change the corporate outlook. Notably, Elon Musk's Tesla, which also holds bitcoin in its treasury, will report its earnings post-market on Tuesday, potentially providing some insight into how traders should price in the trade war uncertainties.

Carter April 22, 2025 2:25 pm EST Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, have faced tough times lately with hundreds of protests against Musk's poisonous politics and Tesla's once-bestselling EVs continuing to take place each day around the world. Just last month, the Tesla Model S and Model X ranked third and ninth respectively on the list of the ten vehicles with the highest five-year depreciation , and a new iSeeCars study reveals that Tesla's depreciation is gaining momentum. Between March 2024 and March 2025, Tesla's Model S lost more value on the used market than any other model in the study, and as a brand, Teslas lost more value than any other manufacturer, year-over-year. More Teslas made the list than any other brand, with four of Tesla's five models in the top 20 cars that lost the most value over the past year. For context, the only other manufacturers with two models on the list were Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler; every other manufacturer had just one model on the list. It seems like people really don't want to be seen in a Tesla regardless of the model, and it's largely thanks to the globally rebuked antics of the brand's inflammatory CEO Elon Musk. The nitty gritty Tesla This study analyzes the average list price of over 1.4 million used cars sold in March 2024, and compares it to the average list price of the same model in March 2025 to determine which used vehicles experienced the most significant loss of value year-over-year. The rankings are determined based on the difference between those two values expressed as a percentage. On average, used car values actually increased overall by 1 percent year-over-year, so these are the outliers. The study found the Tesla Model S lost the most value of any model in the study, at a loss of 17.2 percent; that means it lost $9,944 in value over the course of a single year. The Tesla Model Y scored fifth, experiencing a 13.1-percent drop in value, or $4,634. The Model 3 placed eighth with a 10.9-percent or $3,193 drop, and the Model X placed 17 with a 7.3-percent drop in value, or $4,387 over a single year. The average list price of a used Tesla Model S in March of 2025 fell to $47,931, while the Model Y dropped to $30,611, the Model 3 dropped to $26,084, and the average used Model X dropped to $55,990. Other makes and models on the list Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Tesla Model S experienced the most significant year-over-year price drop, and it beat out the second place Porsche Taycan by over 2 percent; Taycan prices dropped 15.1 percent or $13,422 last year. The Ford Explorer Hybrid landed third on the list, experiencing a 14.1-percent or $5,136 drop in price, the BMW 5 Series Hybrid landed fourth with a 13.9-percent or $5,557 drop in prices. Then came the Tesla Model Y, followed by the Maserati Levante with an 11.5-percent or $5,898 drop, the Mercedes-AMG GT with an 11.1-percent or $9,808 drop, which just outperformed the eighth-place Model 3. Ninth place was the Jeep Gladiator with an average price drop of 10.7 percent or $4,089, and tenth place was the Hyundai Kona Electric with a price drop of 10.6 percent or $2,462. On the brand side, Teslas lost the most value of any brand in the study, losing an average of 10.1 percent of their value year-over-year. Chrysler came in second place with an average price drop of 8.9 percent, followed by Maserati in third place losing 8.6 percent. Genesis placed fourth with a 6.5-percent drop in prices, Dodge placed fifth losing a lower average of 4.7 percent of their value. Buick, Chevrolet, Nissan, Audi, and Volvo round out the top ten.

The article suggests embracing BYD, a leading Chinese EV manufacturer, to boost India's EV ambitions and address the trade deficit with China. TOI.in Arijit Barman Exactly a year after blindsiding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Elon Musk is back to what he does best \u2013 create noise. And India is falling for him once more. Just scroll up his timeline on X and see what he wrote on April 20, 2024. Due to \u2018very heavy Tesla obligations,\u2019 Musk cancelled his much-anticipated India sojourn \u2013 a combination of a family holiday and shopping for land for a $3 billion Tesla gigafactory -- at the last minute. Instead, he flew to Beijing to broker a deal with the Chinese Premier Li Qiang and tech giant Baidu for its mapping and navigation systems for Tesla\u2019s full self-driving (FSD) system in the world\u2019s biggest car market, also Tesla\u2019s biggest outside of the US. What\u2019s the guarantee, he won\u2019t stand us up, again? India has already been \u2018cautiously accommodative\u2019 with its response to Washington\u2019s shotgun tariff ways, while handing out back-to-back distribution deals to Musk\u2019s Starlink with Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. In the process, forcing two of our national champions to make a sharp U-turn after fiercely opposing satellite broadband players to get airwaves cheaply. We have been bitten once. Time to be twice shy. Live Events Instead of wildly wooing Tesla, we should therefore also expand our choice by betting on Shenzhen-based Byd to turbo charge our EV aspirations. We won\u2019t be the only ones outside of China to discover Byd\u2019s potential. The same year Musk had rolled out his ground-breaking debut model, the smartest American capitalist Warren Buffett , chose to put his money to back battery maker-turned-OEM Byd, that was still finalising its e6, an economical five-door compact car. The Oracle of Omaha may now halved his holdings, but only after making 2000% gains on his original $230 million. He\u2019s not selling even amid the ongoing tariff tumult, neither are the suits of Wall Street like Vanguard and Blackrock, the two asset management pillars of Wall Street that own the Byd stock. If Trump has chosen to weaponise currency, commerce and even co-operation, we must also reciprocate. This is hardly the time for misplaced nationalism. Beijing and New Delhi should engage strategically and leverage their common commercial interests and not get stuck over conflicts. There are no permanent friends or enemies in foreign policy. If we can buy Russian crude for our energy security, we should also not dither to get access to Byd\u2019s revolutionary battery and EV technology to ensure a greener, cleaner future for our next generation. One of Trump\u2019s biggest allies in the region, Saudi Arabia on Monday signed a collaboration agreement between Aramco and Byd for new EV technology. What\u2019s good for Riyadh should also be good for Raisina Hill. One answer to our gnawing $100 billion trade deficit with China is to recycle Chinese capital in our country through FDI and create jobs. That could provide another powerful vector for collaboration as world order tumbles. Allow Byd to set up manufacturing but make it a pre-condition for them to dot our petrol pumps along highways with their game changing 5-minute flash charging eco-system. A country whose public transport already relies on Byd\u2019s clean-tech commercial vehicles, there is little logic in holding back its billion dollar FDI plans for passenger EVs other than \u2018Pune protectionism.\u2019 Byd\u2019s flash charging could not have come at a better time. Charging an EV at the same time it takes to fill gas at the station would dispel the single biggest deterrent that is holding up many Indian consumers from making the switch from internal combustion engines. If charging is as convenient as filling up the fuel tank, few would fret about getting stranded on a highway mid journey. A country like ours that lacks access to critical minerals, it also does away with the problem of oversized batteries. Byd, the largest EV maker in the world, just topped $100 billion dollars in FY24 revenues, driving past Tesla. In the Indian context: only 2 companies, Reliance Industries ($112.4 billion) and LIC ( $103.6 billion), are bigger by revenue, while just 8 in Nifty 50 have managed to cross even half of that figure with Tata Motors the only home grown auto company making the cut. Let\u2019s ignore Musk\u2019s polarising politics for a minute but eccentricities aside, Tesla\u2019s fundamental flaws are getting exposed by the day and it starts with its relatively old line-up of models while competition is zipping ahead with cheaper alternatives. The cheap EV plans got postponed again and Cybertruck with its 6-figure price sticker has been calamitous. In comparison, Byd\u2019s hockey stick growth curve is a factor of its portfolio of models across the price spectrum. It is now planning to offer its \u2018God\u2019s Eye\u2019 software in some of its most affordable models to democratise advanced driver assistance technology. It\u2019s tailored for a market like ours. With Tesla becoming a metaphor for Trump\u2019s aggressive foreign policy, it\u2019s hardly a surprise that Beijing has been slow on approving its FSD software, the very reason Musk dumped us in 2024. Expect more blowbacks. Just a fortnight back, an avalanche of fake news around Byd\u2019s new India plans even made commerce minister Piyush Goyal make a statement about India\u2019s need to be cautious about its strategic interests. We need to ask, do we achieve those just by being the handmaiden of a volatile ally that is hell bent on peeling countries away from itself or do we do ourselves better with more bets, arguably better bets.

Market update : Stocks climbed higher on Tuesday, recovering the bulk of Monday's losses. The session began on a strong note and saw a temporary surge shortly after 12 p.m. ET on optimism of a possible easing of tensions between the United States and China. However, the market moved off its session highs after subsequent reporting said negotiations between the two countries \"will be a slog.\" A separate report from Politico also indicated it could take \"months\" to finalize trade deals with countries like Japan and India. The market is eager for trade deals that can help remove some of the worst-case scenarios before the tariffs inflict serious damage on the economy. The potential for some form of de-escalation is one reason we remain long-term constructive on stocks, especially as prices fall and market sentiment becomes increasingly pessimistic. At the same time, in such a fluid trade environment, it's hard to read too much into individual comments from the administration unless they come directly from the President Trump. Up next: Companies reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday include Capital One , Tesla , Chubb , Enphase Energy , Intuitive Surgical , SAP , and Baker Hughes . For Capital One, we'll be monitoring the company's credit trends and will be looking for an update on deal synergies and earnings accretion from the recently approved Discover acquisition. Before the bell Wednesday we'll see earnings from AT & T , Boeing , Boston Scientific , General Dynamics , Norfolk Southern , Checkpoint , Alaska Air , Otis , Thermo Fisher , GE Vernova , CME Group , and Philip Morris . On the data side, there are weekly mortgage applications, new home sales, and S & P Global PMIs. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

In many cases, the attacks occur as protests against Tesla CEO Elon Musk's work in the Trump administration. In March, when the DOJ began going after Tesla vandals, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the wave of attacks was \"nothing short of domestic terrorism\" and ensured that perpetrators would face consequences. Fox News Digital reached out to Adams' attorney, Robert Paule, the Minneapolis Police Department, Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office and Walz's office.

Tim Walz mocked Tesla Tim Walz (Scott Olson/Getty Images), Dylan Adams (Hennepin County Sheriff's Office), Mary Moriarty (Pilottap via Wikimedia Commons) Matthew Xiao April 22, 2025 A Minnesota prosecutor is allowing state employee Dylan Adams to skirt criminal charges for vandalizing Tesla cars and causing more than $20,000 in damages, even after surveillance footage caught Adams vandalizing the vehicles. While police described the video as clear evidence that Adams committed felony-level vandalism, Hennepin county attorney Mary Moriarty (D.) declined to charge the 33-year-old, a program consultant at Democratic governor Tim Walz's Department of Human Services. Surveillance footage shows Adams keying six parked Teslas and stripping their paint\u2014just weeks after Walz mocked the electric car company, saying that watching Tesla stock fall gave him \"a little boost during the day.\" Adams is not a political appointee, a Walz administration spokesperson said. Instead of facing charges, Adams will be enrolled in a diversion program for first-time, low-level offenders, which the county attorney's office said helps \"ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution, as well as reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses.\" The prosecutor's decision comes as Tesla has seen a nationwide surge in vandalism and arson over CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi has called these attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and announced last month that three individuals accused of targeting Tesla facilities with Molotov cocktails are facing up to 20 years in prison. Moriarty became Hennepin County's top prosecutor in January 2023 following donations from groups such as Faith in Minnesota, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from Democratic megadonor George Soros's Open Society Foundations. She has come under scrutiny for repeatedly refusing to prosecute accused rapists and killers, according to the New York Post . In her first week on the job, for example, Moriarty dismissed charges against a 35-year-old man accused of raping a teenage girl, citing attorney misconduct. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said his department is \"frustrated\" by the county attorney's decision. \"The Minneapolis Police Department did its job. It identified and investigated a crime trend, identified, and arrested a suspect, and presented a case file to the Hennepin County Attorney Office for consideration of charges,\" O'Hara told Minneapolis outlet KARE. \"This case impacted at least six different victims and totaled over $20,000 in damages,\" O'Hara continued. \"Any frustration related to the charging decision of the Hennepin County Attorney should be directed solely at her office.\" Published under: Criminal Justice Reform , DAs , District Attorneys , George Soros , Minnesota , Open Society Foundations , Tesla , Tim Walz Latest News TOP HITS Democrats Raphael Warnock Slapped With Ethics Complaint for Living in Free $1 Million Luxury Home Andrew Kerr April 21, 2025 Latest News Arizona Democratic Party Implodes as Party Chairman Accuses Senators Kelly, Gallego of Threats and Intimidation Matthew Xiao April 21, 2025 Campus 'F\u2014 Israel, F\u2014 Zionism': Uproar at Cornell Over Featured Spring Concert Singer Kehlani Jessica Schwalb April 21, 2025 Democrats Ashley Biden's Charity Failed To Disclose $500,000 in Donations to IRS, Complaint Alleges Andrew Kerr April 22, 2025 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/left-wing-prosecutor-wont-charge-minnesota-state-employee-for-vandalizing-teslas/", "source": "Washington Free Beacon", "published_at": "2025-04-22T18:10:49"}, {"id": 2629, "title": "Save exclusive $2,000 on EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra station at new low, Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 + 100 Plus bundle $499, EGO tools, more", "content": "EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra station gets exclusive $2,000 off, more Skip to main content Green Deals Save exclusive $2,000 on EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra station at new low, Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 + 100 Plus bundle $499, EGO tools, more Reinette LeJeune | Apr 22 2025 - 11:03 am PT 0 Comments It\u2019s officially Earth Day and we\u2019ve got another lineup of Green Deals to electrify your life with an take the strain off Mother Earth, starting with the exclusive new low price we\u2019ve secured on EcoFlow\u2019s DELTA Pro Ultra Portable Power Station that has dropped to $3,799 .

Normally going for $5,799 at full price here, while carrying a $6,098 price tag direct from the brand, we last had a massive price cut like this back during Black Friday sales, when things dropped to $4,231 in exclusive savings.

It\u2019s even beating out the brand\u2019s current Earth Day discounts that would run you $539 buying both separately, giving you two solid backup power companions for $40 less while the savings last. Starting with the Explorer 1000 v2 , you\u2019ll have a solid campsite and road trip companion that provides you with a 1,070Wh LiFePO4 capacity and up to 1,500W of steady power output, which surges to 3,000W to cover larger appliances.

Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images file / Updated / Source : CNBC By Steve Liesman, CNBC The broad public and investors have something in common these days: They don\u2019t have a lot of love for either Tesla or CEO Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s stock has undergone a withering sell-off, and the CNBC All-America Economic survey finds more than 47% of the public have a negative view of the company. Another 27% are positive on the electric vehicle maker, while 24% are neutral. That compares with a third of the public who have a positive view of General Motors with 51% neutral and 10% negative. Tesla has been under pressure with concern that its founder\u2019s controversial political activities in cutting government employment and backing President Donald Trump and Republicans could be alienating prospective buyers. Protests have sprung up across the nation at Tesla offices. The survey found Musk to be a highly polarizing figure. Half of the public has a negative view of Musk, compared with 36% who see him positively and 16% who are neutral. Among Democrats, Musk\u2019s net approval (positive minus negative) is -82 and -49 for independents. GOP respondents are +56. The biggest problem for Tesla may be that many groups who are potential customers are far more positive about electric vehicles than they are about the company. \u201cWhere Tesla is strongest is among the people least likely to buy an EV,\u201d said Micah Roberts, partner at Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollster for the survey. Overall, 35% of Americans are negative on EVs and 33% are positive. Men, however, are +11 in net approval of EVs but evenly divided on Tesla. Young people aged 18-34 are +19 on EV\u2019s but -23 on Tesla. The gap is most stark among Democrats, who are +20 on EV\u2019s but -74 on Tesla. Further complicating the issue: Republicans are strongly positive on Tesla, but net negative on EV\u2019s. The survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted April 9 through April 13 and has a margin of error of +/-3.1%.

The electric vehicle maker is fighting an enormous public backlash due to Elon Musk\u2019s leadership of a federal government cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Elon Musk with Tesla car. Tesla is scheduled after market close on Tuesday to provide what is likely to be its most important update on operations since the launch of its Model 3 vehicle in 2017. The electric vehicle maker investors are anxious to know if plans to roll out a cheaper car and a robotaxi service this year are on track, and whether CEO Elon Musk is ready to ditch his role in the Trump administration soon and get back to managing the company more closely. Tesla is fighting an enormous public backlash due to Elon Musk\u2019s leadership of a federal government cost-cutting group that has divided the country and sparked angry protests at Tesla dealerships nationwide. Some analysts have called for Musk to abandon his role in the Trump administration to focus on Tesla. Deliveries in the January-March period slid 13 per cent, as the company lost ground to Chinese rivals, and Musk's political actions as a close adviser to US President Donald Trump have damaged the brand. Tesla has faced protests, vandalism, and consumer calls for boycotts in several markets, and sales in China and California - its largest U.S. market - have fallen sharply as well. Some investors have taken a more sour view of the one-time Wall Street darling. The company's stock, which closed at $227.42 on Monday, has nearly halved from its December peak. Live Events Tariff tensions add further uncertainty. Tesla has paused some China-sourced component imports after U.S. tariffs on the Asian country rose to 145 per cent, Reuters reported. China has responded with tariffs of its own, leading Tesla to suspend new Model S and X orders in the country. FAQs Q1. Who is CEO of Tesla? A1. CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk. Q2.

More with the model S dropping by 17.1%, Tesla It\u2019s no exaggeration to suggest the nation\u2019s economy has been violently upended in what is an eyeblink-brief period of time, particularly with regard to President Trump\u2019s patchwork of trade tariffs. The penalties on imported vehicles and components (including domestic-branded models built elsewhere and/or locally with parts coming from other countries) is almost certain to cause an upward turn in new-vehicle prices among virtually all brands in the weeks and months ahead. According to Kiplinger , this could mean the costs of import cars, trucks and vans could swell by as much as $5,000 to $10,000 for imports and $3,000 for domestic-branded models. With stratospheric sticker prices and stubbornly high financing rates already causing an affordability crisis, the added burden is sure to send a fresh wave of budget-busted shoppers to the used-vehicle market. The added demand for what will be a limited supply of less-costly models, will most likely also send prices at the pre-owned end of a dealership soaring. Those in the market for either a factory-fresh or pre-owned model would be wise go out to kick the proverbial tires before the tariffs make their way through the supply chain and wreak havoc on transaction prices at both ends of the market. In good or bad times, used cars, trucks and SUVs are especially prone to the effects of supply and demand, with the market, rather than automakers, establishing their prices. While that almost always means the most popular models in top shape will tend to command more on a used-car lot, it also suggests that some otherwise competent rides that have somehow fallen out of favor will be far more affordable, being subjected to a quicker-than-average rate of depreciation.

The online vehicle marketplace iSeeCars.com , recently identified the 20 one-to-five-year-old used cars have lost the highest percentages of their values \u2013 in this case between 6.8% and 17.2% \u2013 over the last 12 months, based on 1.4 million used vehicle transactions. That\u2019s compared to an industry average one percent overall increase in the past year. Those in the market for a pre-owned electrified ride should be able to take advantage of the best deals right now, with 10 of the 20 biggest losers on the price-drop list being either hybrid or full electric vehicles. Teslas in particular have been hit hard in terms of price drops, with its pre-owned rides losing an average 10.1% of their worth in the past year, with used Tesla Model S values sliding by a considerable 17.1%. \u201cIn both the new and used car markets, Tesla prices have been dropping for over two years,\u201d says Karl Brauer, iSeeCars Executive Analyst. \u201cPrice cuts on new Teslas immediately impacted used Teslas, driving their prices down at a rapid rate. The new car price cuts were driven by Tesla\u2019s desire to maintain sales growth, but that strategy stopped working last year when the automaker saw its first decline in annual sales.\u201d It certainly doesn\u2019t help that the company\u2019s CEO Elon Musk ersatz excursion into federal politics \u2013 particularly with regard to unprecedented cuts in federal jobs and services \u2013 has eroded the public\u2019s perception of the Tesla brand and its products. In fairness, the list also has its share of luxury models that for a bevy of reasons have had a difficult time finding forever homes. We\u2019re showing iSeeCars\u2019 list of the 20 one-to-five-year-old used cars that have seen the biggest price cuts over the past year, including their average pre-owned prices and the percentages of their respective plunges . Take note that some vehicles, including heavy-duty trucks, low-volume vehicles, those discontinued as of the 2024 model year and units in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from the study.

It's been the most lucrative bet for shorts this year, ahead of Nvidia, whose drop has produced $9.4 billion in profits for short sellers. Tesla reports first-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday. An aerial view of a Tesla showroom on April 02, 2025 in Corte Madera, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images It's been a brutal year for Tesla shareholders so far, and a hugely profitable one for short sellers, who bet on a decline in the company's stock price. Tesla shorts have generated $11.5 billion in mark-to-market profits in 2025, according to data from S3 Partners. The data reflected Monday's closing price of $227.50, at which point Tesla shares were down 44% for the year . The stock rallied about 4.5% on Tuesday, along with gains in the broader market, heading into Tesla's first-quarter earnings report after the close of trading. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The electric vehicle maker is expected to report a slight decline in year-over-year revenue weeks after announcing a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries for the quarter. With CEO Elon Musk playing a central role in President Donald Trump's administration, responsible for dramatically cutting the size and capacity of the federal government, Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany's far-right AfD party. Tesla shares plummeted 36% in the first quarter, their worst performance for any period since 2022, and have continued to drop in April, largely on concerns that President Trump's sweeping tariffs on top trade partners will increase the cost of parts and materials crucial for EV production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells. The company is also struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet's Waymo. Tesla has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June. Tesla has been the biggest stock decliner among tech megacaps this year, followed by Nvidia , which was down about 28% as of Monday's close. The chipmaker has been the second-best profit generator for short sellers, generating returns of $9.4 billion, according to S3. Nvidia is currently the most-shorted stock in terms of value, with $24.6 billion worth sold short, S3 said. Apple is second at $22.2 billion, and Tesla is third at $17.6 billion. Musk has a long and antagonistic history with short sellers, who have made plenty of money at times during Tesla's 15 years on the stock market, but have also been burned badly for extended stretches. In 2020, Tesla publicly mocked short sellers, promoting red satin shorts for sale. \"Limited edition shorts now available at Tesla.com/shortshorts\" Musk wrote in a social media post in July of that year, as the stock was in the midst of a steep rally. Two years earlier, hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital posted a tweet that he received the pairs of short shorts that Musk had promised him. \"I want to thank @elonmusk for the shorts. He is a man of his word!\" Einhorn wrote. Einhorn had previously disclosed that his firm's bet against Tesla \"was our second biggest loser\" in the most recent quarter. In February 2022, after reports surfaced that the Department of Justice was investigating two investors who had shorted Tesla's stock, Musk told CNBC that he was \"greatly encouraged\" by the action and said \"hedge funds have used short selling and complex derivatives to take advantage of small investors.\" PlainSite founder Aaron Greenspan, a former Tesla short seller and outspoken critic of Musk, sued the Tesla CEO alleging he engaged in stock price manipulation for years through a variety of schemes.

President Donald Trump waves before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House ... More on March 7. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Key Facts State Department: Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced plans to reorganize an agency he said is \u201cbloated, bureaucratic, and unable to perform its essential diplomatic mission,\u201d reducing U.S. staff by 15% and closing more than 100 bureaus worldwide, the Associated Press reported , citing State Department documents it obtained. Environmental Protection Agency: The EPA notified about 280 employees working on environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives they would be fired or reassigned, The Washington Post reported , part of an effort to close the EPA\u2019s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, which had placed 171 of its employees on administrative leave then reinstated dozens working in regional offices less than a month later, according to a previous Washington Post report. Health and Human Services: HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in March he would cut 10,000 jobs\u2014in addition to 10,000 employees who took an earlier layoff package\u2014affecting about 15% of the workforce in a reorganization that includes cutting 18% of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6% of National Institutes of Health workers and 4% of employees at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Department of Defense : The Pentagon aims to cut about 60,000 civilian employees, multiple outlets reported in March, after the agency said in February it aimed to cut 5% to 8% of its civilian staff (about 21,000 had reportedly already taken voluntary resignations). Department of Education : The agency announced on March 11 it would begin the process for laying off half of its workers, about 2,000 employees, ahead of Trump\u2019s March 20 executive order aimed at effectively shuttering the department. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: The agency is expected to lay off a total of about 2,000 employees, or 20% of its workforce, multiple outlets reported in mid-March, prompting fears it would affect the agency\u2019s weather forecasting work ahead of hurricane season and other potential natural disasters. Central Intelligence Agency: The agency started to fire some probationary employees in March, multiple outlets reported, after firing some diversity staffers in February who had been placed on leave as part of the Trump administration\u2019s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government. Department of Veterans Affairs : The VA plans to cut more than 80,000 workers beginning in June in an attempt to return to 2019 staffing levels, its chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, said in an internal memo, Reuters reported on March 5. Internal Revenue Service : The IRS was preparing to reduce its nearly 100,000-person workforce by about 50% through layoffs and buyouts, multiple outlets reported in early March, with a reduction of 20% of staff by May 15, CNN reported March 13 \u2014after the Trump administration already laid off about 7,000 IRS workers and reportedly set out to close more than 110 offices in February, at the peak of tax season. U.S. Agency for International Development: Thousands of employees were reportedly given 15-minute windows on Feb. 27 and 28 to clear their office spaces as the Trump administration dismantles the agency and places its foreign aid-distribution responsibilities under the state department, ultimately aiming to reduce staff to 15. Social Security Administration: The agency plans to cut its staff by about 7,000 employees, or 12%, according to multiple reports last month. Labor Department: The agency plans to reduce staff in an office that handles equal employment opportunity laws by 90%, The Washington Post reported in February, though it\u2019s unclear how many employees will be affected. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: The agency\u2014which has open safety investigations into Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla company\u2014laid off 4% of its staff, a spokesman said in a statement that said the agency grew by 30% during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, noting it \u201cretained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes.\u201d Federal Emergency Management Agency: The Trump administration directed senior officials in the FEMA resilience office, which helps communities prepare for potential disasters and mitigate risk, to identify employees who work or worked on \u201cclimate, environmental justice, equity and DEIA\u201d initiatives for potential firings, CNN reported in February, citing an email sent to resilience office officials that said the directive could \u201cimpact the majority\u201d of staff, as Trump suggested previously he wants to eliminate FEMA entirely and DOGE is conducting a review of FEMA operations. TSA: More than 240 employees were fired in February \u201cdue to performance and conduct issues during their probationary period,\u201d TSA spokesperson Robert Langston told Bloomberg \u2014the outlet added it\u2019s not unusual for probationary TSA workers to be terminated due to performance, and the Office of Personnel Management notes it\u2019s \u201cless cumbersome\u201d to fire federal staff during the probationary period soon after they\u2019re hired. Office of Community Planning and Development: The Trump administration is aiming to cut the office, an arm of the department of Housing and Urban Development, from 936 staffers to 150, or 84%, the New York Times reported Feb. 20, citing a document it obtained detailing the plans. Health agencies : Some 5,200 probationary employees across the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were targeted for layoffs, multiple outlets reported in February, with Bloomberg reporting that employees at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration were also laid off. Department of Energy : As many as 2,000 probationary employees at the agency have been fired, Politico reported in February, citing anonymous sources\u2014though Bloomberg reported some department staff who work on nuclear security were asked back. U.S. Forest Service : More than 3,400 employees have been fired, two people familiar with the firings told Politico in February. Small Business Administration : Some probationary employees at the agency received emails notifying them of their terminations, before another email said the initial notices were a mistake, only to be notified in a third email days later confirming their firings, Bloomberg reported in February. Office of Personnel Management : Probationary employees at the office who did not take the Trump administration\u2019s buyout offer were let go in early February, a union official with the American Federation of Government Employees told NPR . Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : The union that represents workers at the financial agency said about 73 of its members had been terminated, after the agency\u2014which has drawn ire from Trump\u2019s tech allies\u2014was ordered to stop all work, though union leaders and the Trump administration reached a deal in mid-February to prevent more agency employees from being terminated while litigation challenging the dismantling of the agency is pending. National Nuclear Safety Administration : An employee at the agency\u2014which oversees nuclear weapons in the U.S.\u2014told NPR in February the agency would fire about 300 of the agency\u2019s 1,800 staff, though the Trump administration reportedly rehired some. General Services Administration : More than 100 people were affected by layoffs at the agency responsible for the federal government\u2019s real estate portfolio, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters in February. Federal Aviation Administration : About 400 FAA were terminated in mid-February, with the layoffs including some in safety-specific roles, the Associated Press reported, though the Department of Transportation said roles that \u201care critical to safety\u201d were spared and the layoffs targeted probationary employees.

What To Watch For The Supreme Court on April 8 halted a lower court ruling ordering the Trump administration to rehire nearly 17,000 probationary workers across six agencies who were terminated in February. In a second case, an appeals court on April 9 also paused a Maryland judge\u2019s ruling ordering 18 agencies to rehire 25,000 terminated probationary workers Who\u2019s Making The Cuts? The significant staff cuts across the federal government have been largely attributed to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, as part of its broader mission to root out purported government waste. In a Cabinet meeting March 6, Trump reportedly told agency heads they ultimately have authority over firings, rather than Musk\u2014a move that could help the Trump administration fight lawsuits over DOGE\u2019s authority. Trump suggested following the meeting that Musk would still have some control, however, telling reporters that if agency heads \u201ccan cut, it\u2019s better, and if they don\u2019t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.\u201d In court, the Trump administration has sought to distance Musk from the terminations, describing his role as \u201cadvisory.\u201d What Other Officials Have Been Fired By Trump? It\u2019s not immediately clear how many staff have been affected by widespread layoffs across the Trump administration, which are separate from voluntary buyout deals offered to more than 2 million federal workers. Trump\u2019s administration has reportedly made a number of other high-profile terminations: At least 17 inspectors general, the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency plus three other FEMA workers, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on cases against Trump, multiple senior FBI officials, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, and several high-ranking military officials, including Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown. Who Are Probationary Employees? Mostly new employees who have been in the federal workforce for less than a year and are not afforded some job protections, including a right to appeal terminations. Probationary employees are the target of the Trump administration\u2019s layoffs, according to multiple reports. More than 200,000 federal workers are probationary employees. How Many Employees Have Resigned Since Trump Took Office? The Trump administration separately offered all federal civilian workers pay with benefits through September if they choose to voluntarily resign, an offer 75,000 federal workers reportedly accepted. The administration has suggested employees who don\u2019t participate in the program could be subject to the mass terminations. What Are The Rules For Mass Layoffs At The Federal Government? Federal regulations of mass layoffs, known as \u201creduction in force,\u201d require the government to give 60 days advance notice of a layoff. The job must also be eliminated entirely\u2014not an attempt to replace a worker, according to the Wall Street Journal . Employees who believe the administration broke protocol in terminating them can file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board. There are also protections in place for independent boards and commissions, such as the NLRB. Presidents can only fire members of the board for \u201cmalfeasance\u201d or \u201cneglect of duty,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. What Other Cuts Are Expected? Trump is aiming for budget cuts between 30% and 40%, on average, across all government agencies, with staffing reductions serving as a major area for spending rollbacks, the Washington Post reported in mid-February, citing two anonymous sources. How Does Trump Want To Use Schedule F To Terminate Employees? Trump signed an executive order to reinstate a policy from his first term that reclassified tens of thousands of federal civilian employees to at-will employees, making it easier for him to fire them by ridding them of their job protections. Several unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union have filed lawsuits to block Schedule F from taking effect. Schedule F is unrelated to the mass layoffs of probationary employees, but is widely viewed as another tool Trump can use to exert outsized power over the makeup of the federal workforce. What Have Republicans Said About The Terminations? Some Republicans have spoken out about the widespread job cuts, with Musk\u2019s controversial email to federal employees asking them to detail five accomplishments sparking some of the sharpest criticism. Multiple Republicans called for Musk to exercise more \u201ccompassion\u201d in his effort to reduce the federal workforce in the wake of the email. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, called the email \u201cabsurd\u201d and likened the directive to \u201cintimidation,\u201d while others expressed concerns that Congress doesn\u2019t have enough information about DOGE\u2019s activities. Musk met with Republicans in March and reportedly attempted to downplay his role in the terminations, insisting they were at the discretion of agency leaders, CNN reported . The White House has also said repeatedly Musk is not in charge of DOGE and is instead a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d who is not paid and acts in an advisory capacity.

East Los Tacos owner Erika Armenta had a final meal at the 101-year-old restaurant before it closed and spoke with a longtime server. First reported by NBC-4 , Armenta eventually hired four Pantry employees, some of whom worked there for 25 years. \u201cOne of our friends suggested hiring them as cooks at our restaurant, since we were short-staffed,\u201d Armenta tells Eater. \u201cThis sparked an idea. I wanted to meet with them and offer a job that would allow them to pursue their true passion, cooking what they loved most: breakfast meals.\u201d The East Los Pantry menu is available daily from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m., with actual longtime Pantry cooks preparing the diner\u2019s pancakes, sausages, and fried potatoes.

Adams, 33, was arrested last week for allegedly causing $20,000 worth of damage to at least six Tesla vehicles in downtown Minneapolis while walking his dog. Instead, HCAO will seek \u201cdiversion.\u201d According to the report, potential \u201ccriminal charges remain on the table,\u201d if Adams were to engage in similar behavior in the future. In a Monday night statement, HCAO spokesman Daniel Borgertpoepping wrote: Our main priorities are to secure restitution for the victims and hold Mr. Adams accountable. As a result, we will file for pre-charge diversion to best facilitate both of those goals. This is an approach taken in many property crime cases and helps to ensure the individual keeps their job and can pay restitution, as well as reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses. Criminal prosecution remains a possibility should unlawful behavior continue. Restitution is important, but it\u2019s not a substitute for accountability. At the time of Adams\u2019 arrest, FOX 9 reported that police considered each of the six incidents a felony, noting that damage to each Tesla exceeded $1,000, meeting the threshold for felony vandalism in every case. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara issued a statement in response to the decision: The Minneapolis Police Department did its job. It identified and investigated a crime trend, identified, and arrested a suspect, and presented a case file to the Hennepin County Attorney Office for consideration of charges. This case impacted at least six different victims and totaled over $20,000 in damages. Any frustration related to the charging decision of the Hennepin County Attorney should be directed solely at her office. Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined. In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same. FOX 9 reached out to Adams\u2019 attorney, Robert Paule, who responded with the following comment: \u201cMy client is very remorseful for his actions and is beginning the process of making sure the victims are made whole financially. We are grateful for the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and apologize to the victims and law enforcement.\u201d Adams should be grateful. He is only remorseful because he was caught and publicly humiliated. Meet Minnesota State employee Dylan Bryan Adams. He was reportedly arrested for allegedly causing over $20,000 in damages to Teslas in Minneapolis after he vandalized them.

First, Soros-backed Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty, 59, has developed a reputation for leniency \u2013 at least for those with the right political affiliations. Even Minnesota\u2019s progressive Attorney General, Keith Ellison, reportedly clashed with Moriarty over her soft-on-crime approach during her first year in office, according to the New York Post. Do this to an abortion clinic and people like Mary lock you away. Unequal, politicized justice. https://t.co/XgQ5qo4yJ7 \u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) April 22, 2025 Mary Moriarty is a different breed of terrible. Even Keith Ellison had to step in and take a case from her after she refused to properly charge a murder. That\u2019s what you get for putting an activist public defender in the lead prosecutor role. Minneapolis wanted this. \u2014 Dustin Grage (@GrageDustin) April 22, 2025 Second, just days before Adams went on his vandalism spree, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz publicly vilified Elon Musk during a town hall in Youngstown, Ohio. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay in America to be successful, we should celebrate that. My beef is once you get successful, don\u2019t be a greedy b**tard and not pay your taxes. What we should demonize is people like Elon Musk.\u201d Not long before that, Walz openly cheered the decline in Tesla\u2019s stock price, making his disdain for the company and its CEO abundantly clear.

Whether that remains a possibility, however, is still unclear. Today, we arrested yet another Tesla attacker \u2014 and we will not negotiate. To those who might join this wave of attacks: it is not worth it. We will find you and put you in prison. https://t.co/f4cot8rKec \u2014 Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) April 18, 2025 One would think that vandals like Adams would know that Teslas come equipped with a built-in suite of 360-degree cameras that provide comprehensive, real-time surveillance around the entire car. According to Tesla\u2019s support page, these cameras are constantly recording when the vehicle is in motion and switch to Sentry Mode when the car is parked. This feature has made Teslas uniquely effective at documenting incidents like vandalism and theft, often providing clear video evidence that has helped law enforcement identify and apprehend suspects. I suppose that while they might be aware of the cameras, for those most deeply afflicted with Musk Derangement Syndrome, the urge to lash out at anything connected to Elon Musk seems to overpower reason, caution, or even basic self-preservation. In their minds, destruction becomes a form of protest, no matter how self-defeating or illegal it may be. Elizabeth writes commentary for Legal Insurrection and The Washington Examiner.

Log in to Reply 0 0 TargaGTS | April 22, 2025 at 2:49 pm I hope journalists keep a very close eye on the \u2018restitution\u2019 that\u2019s requested by the prosecution and eventually ordered by the judge. Depending on the damage that was done, where it was (on the car) and what kind of paint is is, PROPERLY repairing \u2018keying\u2019 of a car can require an full-car respray. Will the judge allow low-ball estimates to repair these vehicles or will the judge order restitution be submitted that fully sates the victims, restoring the cars to original spec? We could see \u2018restitution\u2019 measured in $1K or restitution measured in $7,500 (or more), the rough minimum cost for a full-car respray. (I\u2019m a car nerd, so this is a huge peeve of mine). Log in to Reply 0 5 JWFO | April 22, 2025 at 2:51 pm Isn\u2019t it a \u201chate crime\u201d? Or even domestic terrorism? I feel like there should be federal charges here Log in to Reply 1 1 Milhouse in reply to JWFO . | April 22, 2025 at 7:40 pm It isn\u2019t a \u201chate crime\u201d because it wasn\u2019t motivated by the victims\u2019 perceived sex, race, religion, or any other trait listed by law. Political affiliation isn\u2019t listed. But there\u2019s probably a federal charge to be found, if DOJ looks for one.

Log in to Reply 0 1 inspectorudy | April 22, 2025 at 3:47 pm I thought the left created hate crimes for this exact reason. They demanded Congress pass a hate crime law and they did. Bondi may be able to use it to go after this scum. The law also bars defacing, damaging, or destroying religious property because of the race, color, or ethnicity of persons associated with the property. If any of these Teslas belong to a person of color or a religious group, he may be charged under the hate crime law. Log in to Reply 1 0 Milhouse in reply to inspectorudy . | April 22, 2025 at 7:42 pm Federal civil rights laws don\u2019t cover political affiliation. It doesn\u2019t matter what the victims\u2019 race or religion might be; the crime wasn\u2019t motivated by that. The criminal didn\u2019t even know that. It was motivated by their perceived political affiliation, and that\u2019s not covered.

It\u2019s not alleged. He did it. We have no need for a trial. No need for some leftist judge, no need for any lawyers. Send him to prison. This is the biggest problem with our system of justice.

Log in to Reply 0 0 DaveGinOly | April 22, 2025 at 5:14 pm I agree with the initial portion of your post. Not with the latter. Our system of justice is not only meant to prevent the conviction of innocent persons, it\u2019s been long recognized that that\u2019s at the expense of occasionally not convicting a guilty person. When the system is run as it should be (by the rules and apolitically), it usually works. The problems start when the rules aren\u2019t followed and the decision to prosecute/not prosecute turns on politics (as it does in this situation). It\u2019s not the system that\u2019s failing, it\u2019s the people running it. The system was meant to be run by honest, honorable, and disciplined people, not the sorts who are running too many of these systems across the country. It\u2019s these people who need the heave-ho, not the systems they run.

Analysts predict a sharp decline in Tesla's first-quarter earnings, with expectations of the weakest performance since early 2021 and a notable decrease in global deliveries. Investors are eagerly awaiting updates on Tesla's future plans, including the launch of a lower-cost EV model and the robotaxi platform, as well as signs that Musk will refocus on the company's core operations. Tesla shares sank nearly six per cent on Easter Monday, leaving investors braced for what analysts have called a \u201ccode red\u201d moment for Elon Musk\u2019s firm ahead of its first quarter earnings announcement. The electric vehicle (EV) giant is facing mounting concerns over failing sales, geopolitical headwinds and evolving criticism of Musk\u2019s political involvement, which analysts say is damaging brand perception in key global markets. Shares slide on bearish forecasts Tesla stock closed Monday at $227, down 5.75 per cent. The decline follows a downgrade from Wells Fargo, which issued a fresh \u2018sell\u2019 rating citing weak vehicle deliveries and uncertain near-term outlook. The stock has dropped around 44 per cent year to date, making it the worst-performing member of the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks in 2025. \u201cTesla\u2019s quarterly numbers will be in focus later, as investors look to assess the financial impact of the electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s slumping deliveries\u201d, said Russ Mould, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Tesla\u2019s first quarter earnings are expected to show a sharp drop in performance. Consensus estimates forecast earnings per share of $0.44 and revenue of $21.43bn, which would make it the firm\u2019s weakest quarter since early 2021. Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 13 per cent year on year drop in global deliveries \u2013 its worst delivery performance since 2022 \u2013 amid declining demand in major markets like California and Germany. Brand backlash Tesla\u2019s challenges extend beyond vehicle performance and production issues. The brand has become increasingly polarising, with Musk\u2019s close ties to president Donald Trump and his leadership in the controversial \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d drawing public scrutiny. Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro, cited \u201cpoor vehicle deliveries, auto tariffs and visionary CEO, Elon Musk, taking his eye off the ball from Twitter to SpaceX to DOGE.\u201d Survey data indicates growing reputational risk: repeat buyer rates have declined significantly in blue-leaning US states, and over 30 per cent of surveyed consumers say they would not consider a Tesla due to Musk\u2019s political affiliations. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, long known as a Tesla bull, warned in a recent note that the firm faces a \u201ccode red situation\u201d, if Musk continues to prioritise political engagements over company leadership. \u201cThe turnaround vision must start on Tuesday\u2019s earning call\u201d, Ives said. \u201cIf Musk chooses to stay with the Trump white house it could change the future of Tesla.\u201d What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s recent tariffs are adding to Tesla\u2019s woes. The US administration has floated the possibility of hiking import duties on Chinese EVs, prompting questions about retaliatory measures that could hit Tesla\u2019s operations in China \u2013 where it builds cars for export to Europe and other markets. Product road-map under scrutiny Investors will be looking for updates on Tesla\u2019s long promised lower-cost EV model and its robotaxi platform \u2013 two pillars of the company\u2019s future growth strategy. Musk has previously committed to launching this more affordable model by mid-2025, a simplified and more affordable variant of the Model Y, but delays in production were recently reported . Tesla has not provided a timeline for the roll-out of either initiative, heightening anticipation around today\u2019s earnings call. Investors will be watching closely not only for the numbers announced later today, but for signs that Musk is willing to re-calibrate focus toward core operations and reassert leadership at a time when Tesla\u2019s brand equity and competitive position appear under strain. Following Tesla\u2019s report, other major tech firms like Alphabet and Amazon will deliver their own earnings updates later this week.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 Elon Musk has been ordered to release private emails as part of an ongoing lawsuit against Tesla . A California judge compelled the tech CEO to release the emails to help the court determine whether his company had intentionally misled the public by falsely advertising the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features on Tesla vehicles. Newsweek reached out to Tesla for comment via email. Why It Matters. Tesla is facing a lawsuit in California that accuses the electric vehicle manufacturer of misleading advertising around its self-driving technologies. The lawsuit, filed by plaintiff Briggs A. Matsko in 2022, argues that the company exaggerated the capabilities of its driver assistance systems, which endangered consumers and distorted the public's perception of autonomous driving. The legal action was brought in federal court in San Francisco, seeking damages for individuals who purchased or leased Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot, or Full Self-Driving features since 2016. What To Know The complaint centers on claims that Tesla and CEO Musk repeatedly misrepresented these systems as fully autonomous or nearly so, even though the technology remains incomplete. On April 18, the court ruled that Tesla's proposal of five \"custodians,\" whose records were used in an attempt to prove that the company was not deliberately misleading customers, would not be sufficient. Instead, the court said that Musk would be compelled to act as a custodian for the case, meaning he would have to provide emails and communications to the court. Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the White House on March 24, 2025. Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the White House on March 24, 2025. Getty Images According to court filings, Matsko alleges that Tesla promoted the advanced systems to boost vehicle sales and investments while knowing the features were not capable of fully autonomous operation and could pose safety risks. Matsko, a resident of Rancho Murieta, California, said he paid a $5,000 premium for Enhanced Autopilot in his 2018 Tesla Model X. He alleges that despite advertising, Tesla \"has yet to produce anything even remotely approaching a fully self-driving car.\" Matsko also described Tesla's regular software updates as experimental, with drivers essentially acting as \"untrained test engineers.\" He cited issues such as vehicles steering into oncoming traffic, running red lights, and failing to execute basic turns. The complaint also alleges that Tesla's marketing campaigns, including statements by Musk, falsely implied that breakthroughs were imminent. What People Are Saying In the ruling, the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California said: \"Tesla argues that the information Musk relied on when he made the October 19, 2016 statement 'is not relevant to whether the challenged statements were misleading or false,' and maintains that 'a contrary determination would allow plaintiffs to obtain intrusive discovery from apex custodians simply by including statements from those custodians in their pleadings.' \"These arguments are unpersuasive. LoSavio's surviving claims are based in fraud and negligence, and LoSavio has alleged not only Musk's direct involvement in representations about Tesla's ADAS technology, but also that Musk himself made a statement that is one of the main alleged misrepresentations at issue. \"The documents that Musk relied on in making his statement are plainly relevant to LoSavio's claims because they are relevant, among other things, to Musk's knowledge of his statement's falsity. The court accordingly grants LoSavio's motion to compel Musk and Elluswamy as custodians.\" What Happens Next Tesla has not yet made a statement on the ruling. Musk will be compelled by the court to share his communications with the case. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . Forward-looking: CATL has announced a series of breakthroughs that could reshape the EV industry, promising batteries that are cheaper, lighter, faster to recharge, and more resilient in extreme temperatures, all while extending driving range. The company, which supplies a third of the world's EV batteries to major automakers including GM and Tesla's Shanghai plant, unveiled these just ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show. At a press event reminiscent of a high-profile car launch, China's leading battery maker CATL detailed innovations that could bring electric cars closer to price and performance parity with their gasoline-powered counterparts within the next few years. Batteries account for at least a third of an EV's cost, making CATL's progress particularly significant for automakers worldwide. One of the most notable developments is CATL's new approach to auxiliary batteries. Traditionally, EVs have relied on a single large battery pack, but CATL's design introduces a secondary battery that shares space in the vehicle's underbody. This auxiliary battery is the first commercially available EV battery to eliminate graphite from one of its poles, which could eventually reduce costs and increase energy density by 60 percent per cubic inch. According to Gao Huan, CATL's chief technology officer for EVs in China, this innovation could either extend a car's range or allow for smaller battery packs, freeing up more passenger space. The auxiliary battery also serves as a backup, an increasingly important feature as more vehicles adopt self-driving technologies that demand uninterrupted power supplies. // Related Stories Survey reveals most people panic when their phone battery drops to 38% Watch this electric car demolish a 20-year-old F1 lap record and drive upside down CATL's co-president for research and development, Ouyang Chuying, indicated that these graphite-free batteries could appear in production vehicles within two to three years, though he declined to name specific automakers. However, the company acknowledged that removing graphite comes with trade-offs, namely that such batteries recharge more slowly and have a shorter lifespan. CATL has also made strides in charging speed for its main batteries. The latest iteration of its flagship Shenxing battery cell can add 520 kilometers (about 320 miles) of range with just five minutes of charging, surpassing even the recent advancements announced by rival BYD and placing CATL ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz. The second-generation Shenxing battery offers an 800-kilometer range on a single charge, achieving a peak charging speed of 2.5 kilometers per second. CATL's Gao emphasized that the new batteries do not compromise on energy density and are slated to be installed in more than 67 electric vehicle models this year. In addition to lithium-based innovations, CATL is pushing forward with sodium-ion battery technology. The company's new Naxtra brand of sodium-ion batteries, set to enter mass production in December, promises over 90 percent charge retention even at temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius. This makes them especially attractive for vehicles operating in the frigid climates of northern China, where traditional lead-acid batteries often fail. The first customer for these batteries will be freight trucks from First Auto Works, based in Changchun, a region known for its harsh winters. Sodium-ion batteries are considered a safer and more affordable alternative to lithium-based cells, largely because sodium is abundant and inexpensive. The new Naxtra battery boasts an energy density of 175 watt-hours per kilogram, nearly matching the widely used lithium iron phosphate batteries. CATL's founder, Robin Zeng, has suggested that sodium-ion batteries could eventually replace up to half of the market for lithium iron phosphate batteries, which the company currently dominates. Beyond technical specifications, CATL has demonstrated the safety of its sodium-ion batteries through rigorous stress tests, including puncturing and cutting the cells without causing fires or explosions \u2013 a notable shift from the company's stance just five years ago. These batteries are also being positioned as a solution for internal combustion vehicles, offering compatibility with existing electrical systems, though some models may require modifications to accommodate the new battery size. CATL's rapid pace of innovation comes even as the company faces increased competition and market pressures. Last month, the company reported a 15 percent growth in net profit for 2024, its slowest rate in six years, amid a prolonged price war in China's EV market. Still, with over 18 million cars equipped with its batteries operating in more than 66 countries, CATL's influence on the future of electric mobility remains formidable. 6 comments 72 likes and shares Share this article: Featured on TechSpot BYD charger can add 250 miles of range in just 5 minutes CATL's new battery promises 800-km range and 5 minute charging Most Popular 13 comments Google demos Android XR smart glasses with Gemini AI, visual memory, and multilingual capabilities 17 comments 10 Tech Enthusiast Guilty Pleasures: (A.K.A.

Prediction markets are offering wagers on a range of Tesla-related ( TSLA ) outcomes that have little to do with the numbers. At PolyMarket, you can bet on the number of times Musk , the company\u2019s CEO, says certain things during the company\u2019s conference call later today. Options range from \u201cAI\u201d (or \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d) to \u201cMAGA\u201d (or \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d). The likelihood of the former happening was recently given as 97%, the highest expected odds in the platform\u2019s list, meaning a successful $10 bet would get you $10.06. The latter odds were recently 10%, meaning $10 would get you nearly $54. (You also can bet on words like \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cMars,\u201d and \u201c inflation .\u201d) At Kalshi, among other bets, $10 successfully wagered on the chance that any Tesla representative says the word \u201cRoadster\u201d will get you $19. Investors, meanwhile, expect a substantial move in Tesla's shares in coming days. Wall Street analysts remain divided on their expectations for the electric vehicle maker's results.

Politics Top House Democrat says DOGE data access at NLRB may be 'technological malfeasance' April 15, 2025 4:48 PM ET By Stephen Fowler , Jenna McLaughlin Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., speaks during the House Oversight Committee meeting at the U.S. Capitol on March 25. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee is calling for an investigation into DOGE's access to the National Labor Relations Board following exclusive NPR reporting on sensitive data being removed from the agency. Ranking Member Gerry Connolly, D-Va., sent a letter Tuesday to acting Inspector General at the Department of Labor Luiz Santos and Ruth Blevins, inspector general at the NLRB, expressing concern that DOGE \"may be engaged in technological malfeasance and illegal activity.\" \"According to NPR and whistleblower disclosures obtained by Committee Democrats, individuals associated with DOGE have attempted to exfiltrate and alter data while also using high-level systems access to remove sensitive information\u2014quite possibly including corporate secrets and details of union activities,\" Connolly wrote in a letter first shared with NPR . \"I also understand that these individuals have attempted to conceal their activities, obstruct oversight, and shield themselves from accountability.\" Sponsor Message Technology A whistleblower's disclosure details how DOGE may have taken sensitive labor data According to an official whistleblower disclosure shared with NPR, interviews with the whistleblower and records of internal communications, technical staff members at the NLRB were alarmed about what DOGE engineers did when they were granted access, particularly when those staffers noticed a spike in data leaving the agency. Daniel Berulis started working at the NLRB six months before President Trump started his second term. Grace Raver/NPR hide caption toggle caption Grace Raver/NPR \"I can't attest to what their end goal was or what they're doing with the data,\" the whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, said in an interview with NPR. \"But I can tell you that the bits of the puzzle that I can quantify are scary. ... This is a very bad picture we're looking at.\" Connolly shared similar concerns in his letter, highlighting the fact that billionaire businessman and DOGE leader Elon Musk's companies like SpaceX, Tesla and X have cases pending before the NLRB and the Department of Labor. Berulis saw around 10 gigabytes of data leave NLRB's network \u2014 or the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias if someone printed them. Much of that data came from a system that houses information about pending cases, proprietary data from corporate competitors, personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, and witness testimony. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including the Privacy Act . Technology 5 takeaways about NPR's reporting on the whistleblower report about DOGE at the NLRB The letter asks the inspectors general to answer a number of questions regarding ways DOGE may have potentially violated federal law, including any NLRB networks DOGE staffers had access to and what records of DOGE's work within NLRB systems exist. NPR reported that DOGE staffers demanded \"tenant owner level\" access, which offers essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy and alter data, according to the whistleblower disclosure to Congress. The disclosure also noted that controls to prevent insecure or unauthorized mobile devices from logging on to the system without the proper security settings were disabled, an interface was exposed to the public internet, and internal alerting and monitoring systems were found to be manually turned off, among other things. Sponsor Message Someone with an IP address in Russia tried to log in with the username and password of a newly created DOGE account just minutes after its creation, the disclosure reads. In over a dozen lawsuits in federal courts around the United States , judges have demanded that DOGE explain why it needs such expansive access to sensitive data on Americans, from Social Security records to private medical records and tax information. But the Trump administration has been unable to give consistent and clear answers, largely dismissing cybersecurity and privacy concerns. doge Elon Musk Congress Facebook Flipboard Email Sponsor Message Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5366152/doge-nlrb-democrats-musk", "source": "NPR", "published_at": "2025-04-15T20:48:30"}, {"id": 2483, "title": "Tesla Stock Price Reaches \u2018Death Cross\u2019 Status", "content": "Tesla Stock Price Reaches 'Death Cross' Status Skip to content By AJ Dellinger Published April 15, 2025 | Comments ( 305 ) | \ud835\udd4f Copied! US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to the press as they stand next to a Tesla Cybertruck on the South Portico of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. \u00a9 Mandel NGAN / AFP If you haven\u2019t been keeping tabs on Tesla\u2019s stock price (understandable, it\u2019s like the 1,025th most interesting thing that is happening in a world plagued by chaos), you\u2019ve missed a whole lot of volatility. Crucially, you may have also missed its index displaying the dreaded \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a historical indicator of a likely downturn for the company. Business Insider called out the event , which has been hitting the stock indexes of some major players over the last couple of weeks as tariff trouble has hit just about everyone. Tesla is just the latest to see the symbol of bearishness, which occurs when a company\u2019s 50-day moving average crosses and drops below the 200-day average. The \u201cdeath cross\u201d showing itself for Tesla shouldn\u2019t come as a huge shock, just given how wild a ride the electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s value has undergone in the last few months, spurred in large part by the fact that its CEO seems to be more interested in playing wrecking ball to the federal government than actually running the company. Tesla has seen more than a third of its value wiped off the board since the start of the year, despite some spikes along the way when it seemed like Musk might be able to eke out some preferential treatment from the Trump administration. He did get a free advertisement for the company in front of the White House , but that only came after widespread protests against the company put a dent in its reputation and future prospects. Tesla is far from alone in flashing the \u201cdeath cross.\u201d The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both showed it as well on Monday, as the indexes continue to fluctuate in wild and somewhat unpredictable ways thanks to the endless uncertainty that the Trump administration has introduced to the market through its blanket tariffs and \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d exceptions that keep getting tacked on and taken off . Seeing that Tesla got hit with the death cross might provide a little thrill in a Tim Walz laughing at Tesla\u2019s declining stock price kinda way. But I have to be honest, as someone who is not fully immersed in the financial markets, the chart pattern reading kinda strikes me as astrology for guys in suits. Like, because the line displays a pendant shape , that means it\u2019s primed to break out? What does that even mean? You might as well say it\u2019s a good time to buy because Mercury is in retrograde. Anyway, analysts apparently don\u2019t think death crosses are as reliable of an indicator as they are sometimes described by chart readers. According to Reuters , about half the time that a death cross appears, it marks the worst point for the index rather than a harbinger of a steeper decline. Regardless, it\u2019s probably fine to taunt Tesla-maxxers with this news if you want an easy laugh.

A 12-foot Elon Musk bust inspired by a 2019 Reddit meme has been vandalized near the town of Boca Chica Village in south Texas. The statue, which lies along a road leading to the Musk-owned SpaceX facility Starbase \u2014 a seaside complex the billionaire is attempting to convert into an autonomous town \u2014 was damaged over the weekend of April 5, coinciding with nationwide protests against the Trump administration and DOGE\u2019s federal job cuts. Inscribed with the title \u201cElon, aka MemeLord,\u201d the foam and fiberglass statue was commissioned by ElonRWA , a cryptocurrency \u201cmemecoin\u201d currently valued at $0.000034. The crypto token is based on a real-life portrait of Musk that went viral six years ago for its absurd, wide-jawed depiction of the billionaire. ElonRWA confirmed to Hyperallergic in an email that the Texas bust, erected last August by the group, was vandalized by \u201cElon Musk haters.\u201d Get the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic. Daily Weekly Opportunities Sign up Photos reviewed by Hyperallergic show a gash in the sculpture\u2019s right cheek beneath the eye and several marks that appear to be from knife stabs to the cheek and chin. It is unclear who is behind the damage, but the landowner of the property where the statue sits told ABC News that he filed a report with authorities. The Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office has not yet responded to Hyperallergic \u2019s inquiry. The incident comes amid a wave of vandalism targeting Tesla dealerships and the brand\u2019s vehicles over Musk\u2019s right-wing politics and outsized influence over the Trump administration. In response, the Justice Department has described the uptick in the destruction of property at Tesla dealerships as acts of \u201c domestic terrorism .\u201d Other vigilantes have graffitied Cybertrucks in acts of protest. ElonRWA purchased the real sketch behind the meme, which Reddit user Watchieboy shared in 2019 along with the earnest message, \u201cTried drawing Elon Musk. I\u2019m fairly new to drawing portraits and would appreciate any advice/criticism!\u201d The crypto group then contracted a Utah 3D printing fabrication agency to bring the work to life. The coin\u2019s cofounder, a French tech professional who goes by the moniker Louis XXII, said in an August interview that the statue was meant to bring the meme \u201cinto the real world,\u201d but for what purpose remains a mystery. When asked to provide a statement on the vandalism, an ElonRWA spokesperson provided Hyperallergic with a message for the culprit: \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the Meme culture \ud83d\ude18.\u201d On X, ElonRWA unseriously remarked on the situation, \u201cWe will keep supporting Elon\u2019s mission to make life multiplanetary and extend the light of consciousness to the stars. Occupy Mars!\u201d Before planting the bust near Starbase last summer, a Cybertruck hauled the newly unveiled sculpture through the nearby city of Brownsville as part of an event dubbed \u201cElon Day\u201d on August 25. Similarly, in 2022, creators of a cryptocurrency called ElonGOAT \u2014 worth even less than the token behind the damaged bust \u2014 dragged a 30-foot-long sculpture of Musk\u2019s head on a goat\u2019s body through Austin to celebrate the billionaire. ElonRWA did not provide additional information on whether the bust will be repaired or when. However, the landowner told ABC News that another artist has offered to repair the statue. The vandalism of the Texas sculpture comes as Musk\u2019s approval ratings sour in national polls and as massive protest movements against Trump and the billionaire continue to gain steam across the US.

Felix Mizioznikov/Getty Images More than 300,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US during the first quarter of 2025, according to the latest report from Kelley Blue Book. That number makes up 7.5% of all new vehicle sales, which marks year-over-year growth compared to the 7% of EVs sold by this point in 2024. Despite the market growth, not all automakers were represented equally in new EV sales. New electric models from Acura, Audi, Chevrolet , Honda and Porsche are driving higher sales figures for those automakers. General Motors experienced some of the most extreme EV sales growth, with over 30,000 electric vehicles across GM brands being shipped during the first quarter. Tesla sales took the biggest hit, falling 9% from last year. Tesla's struggles are well publicized. The launch of the Cybertruck has been plagued with recall after recall . The company has also faced intense public backlash in response to Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration as the head of DOGE . The automaker has been the target of showroom protests across the country, with consumer sentiment for the EV company dropping even more rapidly overseas . The 2025 iteration of the Tesla Model Y is launching in the US this spring, which could help increase the company's sales numbers in the next quarter. The looming market uncertainty is one of the biggest reasons for the first-quarter sales surge. New international tariffs instituted by President Donald Trump will have an outsized effect on the automotive industry. Though just one-third of the EVs sold in the US are imported vehicles, the tariffs will increase the costs of some of the most important materials in the electric vehicle supply chain, including steel and aluminum. China, the country with the highest US-levied tariffs , is also the leading supplier of EV battery materials. The budding trade war threatens to heavily distort the electric vehicle market. It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will reverse Biden-era EV purchasing incentives . Repealing these initiatives could cause EV sales to plummet in the US market during the second half of 2025.", "sentiment": "POSITIVE", "sentiment_score": 0.6, "url": "https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-sales-increased-by-more-than-10-in-the-us-despite-tesla-sales-dropping/", "source": "CNET", "published_at": "2025-04-15T19:45:49"}, {"id": 2446, "title": "Sam Altman's OpenAI Explores Creating Social Media Competitor To Elon Musk's X", "content": "Sam Altman's OpenAI Explores Creating Social Media Competitor To Elon Musk's X How are Trump\u2019s tariffs impacting US inflation?

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with MSFT. Sources told the outlet that the idea is still in the early stages, but an internal prototype includes a social feed centered on image generation through ChatGPT. It's not yet clear if the project will launch as a new app or be folded into the existing ChatGPT platform, which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said reaches about 10% of the global population. OpenAI hasn't commented publicly on the report. The news lands as tensions between Altman and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk continue to grow. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who is now suing the company and Microsoft, reportedly made a $97.4 billion all-cash offer to acquire OpenAI earlier this year a bid Altman rejected. Altman later joked online that OpenAI would buy Twitter, now X, for $9.74 billion. Musk's xAI, a rival to OpenAI, recently completed an all-stock acquisition of X. Its Grok chatbot, now available in a standalone app, pulls from X's social posts to train its AI models. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

All rights reserved. \u00d7 What's Hot LOADING ERROR LOADING DETROIT (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump hinted that he might temporarily relieve the auto industry from \u201cpermanent\u201d tariffs he previously imposed on the business. The president didn\u2019t specify how long the potential pause would be or what it would entail, but the auto sector is awaiting how rules might change on 25% tariffs based on U.S. parts, if duties remain on assembled vehicles. Experts have said short pauses aren\u2019t likely to give carmakers enough of an opportunity to adjust their vast global supply chains, though parts exemptions would certainly bolster the industry amid Trump\u2019s trade war whiplash. Advertisement Trump told reporters Monday that automakers \u201cneed a little bit of time because they\u2019re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I\u2019m talking about things like that,\u201d referring to relocating production from Canada, Mexico and elsewhere. The news drove global auto stocks up Tuesday. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents domestic auto companies Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said in a statement: \u201cThere is increasing awareness that broad tariffs on parts could undermine our shared goal of building a thriving and growing American auto industry, and that many of these supply chain transitions will take time.\u201d Trump first announced 25% automotive tariffs late March; the tariffs for completed vehicles took effect on April 3, while the parts tariffs were set to start 30 days later. Advertisement \u201cThe one-month delay is intended to give the U.S. government time to work out rules to exempt the value of automotive parts that contains U.S.-made materials, which will not be subject to the tariffs,\u201d according to insights from law firm Foley & Lardner, noting a \u201ccarveout\u201d for parts certified under regional trade pact, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The Department of Commerce is expected to determine \u201ca system to calculate non-U.S. content\u201d by May 3. At the same time, automakers are navigating steel and aluminum imports levies of at least 25%; 25% duties on all goods from Canada and Mexico ; 10% global tariffs and reciprocal tariffs around the world \u2014 paused for 90 days, and both of which automotive is exempt from; and tariffs on China at 145%. The United Auto Workers labor union, and Autos Drive America, which represents foreign automakers, did not respond to requests for comment. Advertisement The on-again, off-again tariffs have already wrought havoc for any number of global sectors but especially the auto industry , which relies on a complex network of parts from around the world. Despite his close proximity to Trump through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has strayed from the president\u2019s views on tariffs. \u201cImportant to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here,\u201d Musk himself posted on his social media platform X. \u201cThe tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.\u201d Advertisement Teslas sold in the U.S. have a great deal of parts supplied and vehicles assembled here, and the company claims it has the \u201cmost American-made cars.\u201d Varying trims of the Tesla Model Y and 3 are at least 85% domestic content, according to an annual Made in America auto index . For comparison, Ford builds about 80% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S. domestically. The American and European car industries are \u201cseverely affected by tariffs. On top of the 25% tariff imposed on vehicles, we are impacted by layer upon layer of additional compounding tariffs including those on aluminum, steel, and parts,\u201d Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said in the company\u2019s annual general meeting Tuesday, noting at the same time, the Chinese auto market\u2019s potential for growth this year. \u201cBut it\u2019s not too late if the U.S. and Europe take the necessary urgent actions to promote an orderly transition,\u201d Elkann added. \u201cWe are encouraged by what President Trump indicated yesterday on tariffs for the car industry.\u201d Advertisement Though Trump says his tariffs are intended to bolster U.S. auto manufacturing , automakers aren\u2019t able to reconfigure their sourcing in short periods of time, experts say. Because of the nature of the business and the length of time it takes to design product and get manufacturing up and running, it could take years to reevaluate sources of supply and establish new assembly operations. \u201cFlipping upside down a global supply chain that has been in place for decades cannot happen overnight for the auto industry,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note, \u201cand we strongly believe the clear right move would be to focus on finished cars made in the U.S.\u201d versus auto parts. Advertisement The tariffs as they currently stand are sure to cost automakers billions of dollars, impact new and used vehicle supply and raise prices for car buyers at dealerships by thousands of dollars. Already, some auto manufacturers have paused operations in Canada and Mexico and temporarily laid off workers in the U.S. Some have also attempted to get ahead of the impact of tariffs through appeals to customers. In rare moves, Ford, Hyundai, Genesis and Jeep-maker Stellantis began offering employee pricing programs for a limited time to reach buyers before what will most likely be steep price hikes. Advertisement Car buyers might be better positioned for an extra few weeks, depending on the latest policy change. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter.

Far from backing down, two new studies by the Capital Research Center (CRC) show that the unsavory elements behind the pro-Hamas movement are now rebranding into a radical, violent, anti-police movement. Their goal: to use racial tension and outrage over police misconduct to legitimize defunding, abolishing, and outright killing the police. CRC\u2019s most recent study, When Charities Betray America: How \u201cPro-Palestinian\u201d Protest Groups Promote Anti-Americanism , found that 500 of the most significant anti-Israel organizations and activists in the U.S have increased their anti-police and anti-American rhetoric cumulatively by 186% in the 15 months before and after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023. The word \u201cpig\u201d alone has increased inusage by 1,088%. The pro-terrorism non-profit U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights , which has 329 groups listed in its network, even suggests using protest signs that read , \u201cABOLISH THE POLICE AND FREE PALESTINE.\u201d That couldn\u2019t be any clearer. (RELATED: Legal Group Joining Anti-Tesla Movement Has Violent, Far Left History) This, unfortunately, is not new. An earlier CRC study, Marching Towards Violence: The Domestic Anti-Israeli Protest Movement , identified over 150 pro-terrorism and terror-linked organizations, including actual domestic terrorist groups and many non-profits, who frequently (albeit indirectly) justified terrorist attacks on police officers by praising October 7 perpetrators like Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine for attacking Israeli military and police personnel and then equating American law enforcement with the Israelis. They assert that the Israeli and U.S. authorities are jointly committing a \u201cgenocide\u201d of minorities, each warranting a similar response. When you look at specific groups, the picture grows far worse: One of the groups with the most significant online presences is Unity of Fields , the American wing of the U.K.-based Palestine Action . In September, this group declared, \u201call Zionists, police & surveillance infrastructure are legitimate targets,\u201d and left no doubt that it meant \u201ctarget\u201d in the most literal sense by displaying the Hamas-associated upside-down red triangle symbol. The triangle is used in Hamas\u2019 published combat footage to show viewers the enemy target it is attacking. Another pro-Hamas group that arguably qualifies as a domestic terrorist group, Within Our Lifetime , also consistently glorifies protestors\u2019 attacks on police and resisting arrests. But by far the most alarming group to embrace this new strategy is Students for Justice in Palestine\u2019s , a massive organization which has declared itself to be a literal part of Hamas and the other terrorist groups involved in the October 7 attacks. Yet now, its social media channels have taken a different tack: excusing and even glorifying violence against police. As just one example, when SJP\u2019s UCLA chapter learned of an imminent police crackdown on its encampment, it held a \u201cDealing with Cops\u201d workshop that included \u201cself-defense training.\u201d In another incident, Carrie Zarema, an SJP spokesperson, was caught distributing a Google Drive link with over 200 terrorism-related files, including instructional guides related to resisting and evading arrest, weaponry, combat, rioting, taking over buildings, and various other guerilla-style militant actions that qualify as acts of terrorism. If you read \u201cPro-Palestinian\u201d chats and published documents, the reason for this shift becomes obvious. A memo that Haters Caf\u00e9 published was reposted by Sprout Disinfo and then widely distributed online within the \u201cpro-Palestinian\u201d community urged protestors to strategically adopt the \u201cBlack liberation\u201d cause at all of their demonstrations: \u201cThe breaking of the Gaza wall is reminiscent of the destruction of the 3rd precinct in Minneapolis\u2026. In the United States, the first step for Palestine Solidarity is to make its position clear on Black liberation.\u201d In other words, the radicals know the Palestine issue will fade from the headlines, whereas the anti-police movement and racial tensions will always be relevant. They can retain the infrastructure they\u2019ve built and attract militant allies by integrating it into the anti-police movement and then reel it into their cause when they are able to. They are determined to last; it is equally imperative that those with the power to stop them know how to prevent that . Ryan Mauro is an investigative researcher for the Capital Research Center.

The lawsuit alleges Tesla does this to close out warranties early on their products. The lawsuit, however, stands on a filed patent which may or may not be in use in Tesla vehicles. Tesla owner Nyree Hinton brought the case against Tesla forward. Here's what they're claiming, according to CarScoops : The case was filed by Nyree Hinton, who says they bought a 2020 Tesla Model Y in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on it. Hinton states that from December 14, 2022, to February 6, 2023, they averaged 55.54 miles per day, but between March 26, 2023, and June 28, 2023, this spiked to 72.53 miles per day, just as the Model Y was approaching its warranty expiration. The owner estimates that the average mileage should have been roughly 20 miles fewer per day because of their consistent routine during this time. In the instance of their Model Y, Hinton says they drove 6,086 miles but the Tesla recorded 13,228 miles. The lawsuit is based on a patent that Tesla filed for a seemingly tricky form of recording milage. The patent calls for a \"miles-to-electrical energy conversion factor\" that would take in factors like charging behavior and road conditions into the calculation of miles traveled instead of a direct recording of miles traveled. The lawsuit alleges Tesla is using this technology instead of mechanical or electrical systems that faithfully record miles traveled, in order to shorten warranties based on miles-driven in the cars. Tesla's many woes Cheng Xin/Getty Images There's no proof that Tesla ever put that technology into use in its cars, but there's been talk on forums about Teslas over-estimating miles driven for years. It'll be interesting to see what happens in discovery should this lawsuit go to trial. As it stands, Tesla warranties on its vehicles range from 100,000 to 150,000 miles , depending on the model. Tesla has faced plenty of litigation over the years, though its outlook in 2025 is very different. In 2024, it faced legal battles on everything from being accused of spewing pollution from its plant in California , to settling the lawsuit of the family of an Apple engineer who burned to death in a Model X , to a massive class action lawsuit from Tesla owners over self-driving promises . Yet none of those cases could do to Tesla's reputation quite what the actions of its own CEO have achieved. Elon Musk's unpopular political involvement has sent sales of his company's cars plummeting around the world and here at home. Despite falling demand and growing problems, Musk has still found the time to work towards on getting his $56 billion pay day out of litigation from the state of Delaware, most recently by attempting to change the law that's preventing this truly dazzling sum of money from hitting his bank account.

Why It Matters Since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China , including a 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports and a 10 percent tariff on Canadian energy imports, concerns have been sparked about a trade war between the two countries. Some Canadian customers have boycotted American products, encouraged by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , who called for citizens to \"buy Canadian\" in response.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's chartered Air Canada plane arrives at Kelowna International Airport, in Kelowna, B.C., on Friday, April 4, 2025. Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP Meanwhile, Canada has barred Tesla vehicles from being eligible for the country's electric vehicle rebate because of the tariffs and has announced a package of retaliatory tariffs worth C$155 billion. The issues have impacted the tourism sector, too. According to aviation analytics provider OAG, forward bookings from Canada to the U.S. have fallen by more than 70 percent for every month through to the end of September compared to the same period last year. The U.S. heavily relies on travelers from Canada. If tourism numbers decline, there will be a significant impact on the U.S. economy. What To Know According to data from Statistics Canada, there was a 32 percent drop in the number of Canadians who took road trips into the U.S in March 2025 compared to March 2024. The data said there was also a 13.5 percent decline in air travelers from Canada in a year. The U.S. Travel Association (USTA) said in February that a 10 percent reduction in tourism from Canada could put 140,000 jobs at risk and result in $2.1 billion in lost spending. Forbes said that, using that calculation, a decline of 30 percent in Canadian visitors would cost the U.S. economy $6 billion in losses. What People Are Saying Bryan S. R. Grimwood, professor and associate chair at the department of recreation and leisure studies at the University of Waterloo, told Newsweek there is \"a significant change in Canadian travel preferences and decision-making\" which is \"significant\" for relations between the U.S. and Canada. \"In my read of the situation, the decline in Canadian travel to the US is a function of three interrelated things: (1) an uncertainty about visiting the US due to potential safety concerns and inconvenience (e.g., at the border); (2) a refusal to spend travel dollars in the US as a response to the Trump administration's intimidation tactics relating to trade, border security, and sovereignty; and (3) a rise in Canadian patriotism that is translating into a choice to support Canadian businesses, services, and products,\" he said. \"I do think the decline in Canadian travel to the US is significant for relations between the two countries. My sense though is that Canadians continue to cherish and respect the American people \u2013 as our government leaders have consistently expressed \u2013 and that the current moment is a reaction specifically to the Trump administration's approach.\" Lana Payne, the national president of Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, previously told Newsweek : \"Canada has always considered itself to be America's best friend and closest ally, but that relationship has been severely damaged by the actions of President Trump.\" What Happens Next It remains to be seen whether a U.S. travel boycott by Canadians is sustained and the impact this might have on the U.S. economy. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey Call For Abolition Of All Intellectual Property Laws, Arguing There Are 'Much Greater Models To Pay Creators' Namrata Sen Tue, Apr 15, 2025, 1:30 PM 3 min read In This Article: TSLA -6.43% Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ), and Jack Dorsey , co-founder of Twitter (currently X) as well as Square, now called Block Inc. (NYSE: XYZ ), have ignited a debate over intellectual property rights. The tech magnates have suggested a complete eradication of IP laws, a move that has stirred controversy in the tech industry. What Happened : Dorsey initiated the discussion with a post on X stating, \u201cdelete all IP law.\u201d Musk, who now owns X (formerly Twitter), promptly agreed with Dorsey\u2019s sentiment. The discussion comes amid ongoing lawsuits faced by AI companies, including OpenAI, co-founded by Musk, over alleged copyright violations. Trending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. The debate has drawn a mixed bag of reactions. Tech evangelist Chris Messina supported Dorsey\u2019s stance. He wrote on BlueSky social, \u201cJack has a point\" as \"Automated IP fines/3-strike rules for AI infringement may become the substitute for putting poor people in jail for cannabis possession.\" Meanwhile, others, like Ed Newton-Rex of Fairly Trained , on BlueSky, criticized the interaction between the tech executives. \u201cTech execs declaring all-out war on creators who don't want their life's work pillaged for profit,\u201d posted Newton-Rex. Why It Matters : The exchange of views between the tech innovators comes at a time when Meta Platforms \u2018 (NASDAQ: META ) Llama AI models have been caught in a copyright lawsuit over the use of pirated e-books for training. Dorsey\u2019s and Musk\u2019s recent comments are in line with their long-held views on intellectual property rights. Dorsey has been a vocal critic of IP laws, viewing them as barriers to innovation. In his subsequent posts under the current one, he argued that the current IP system restricts creativity and unfairly benefits gatekeepers at the expense of creators.

There are \"much greater models to pay creators\" while claiming \"the current ones take way too much from them and only rent-seek,\u201d posted Dorsey. Similarly, Musk\u2019s endorsement of Dorsey\u2019s post is consistent with his 2014 Tesla patent pledge not to enforce patents against \u201cgood faith\u201d users. However, in a twist of events, Tesla sued Australian company, Cap-XX in 2023, suspecting the supercapacitors used for energy storage in EV batteries likely infringed on two U.S. patents held by a Tesla subsidiary. Story Continues Their recent comments have reignited the conversation around intellectual property rights in the tech industry, a topic that will undoubtedly continue to be a point of contention.

Yet her appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cMisinfoNation: Extreme America\u201d Sunday was as notable for O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s questions as for Lorenz\u2019s aiming-to-shock answers. If indeed voting for Trump and making a hero out of a murderer both arise \u201cbecause a lot of people are just really really desperate,\u201d as O\u2019Sullivan opined on air, then the real story CNN ought to be covering is the life-and-death difference between the political right and the violent left. See Also Taylor Lorenz defends Luigi Mangione fangirls in glib CNN interview: \u2018Morally good man\u2019 Lorenz accepted O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s premise: Trump voters and Mangione-lovers are alike, she agreed, because \u201cThey want somebody to take on the system. They want somebody to tear down these barbaric establishment institutions.\u201d Brian Thompson wasn\u2019t an institution \u2014 he was a man whose slaughter hasn\u2019t changed anything. Under Trump, the populist right organized to win at the ballot box and use lawful authority to shake up institutions, which is what the president is now doing. The Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol by Trump supporters was uncharacteristic of what has otherwise been a nonviolent political movement for reform. But violence is all too characteristic of left-wing activism in the streets \u2014 and of the mentality behind it, as the Lorenz interview testifies. Faced with defeat at the polls and an administration using its mandate to change institutions, the left has quickly despaired of politics and turned toward violence , escalating from vandalism to arson attacks, as in New Mexico recently, against Tesla automobiles and Republican headquarters.

Progressives who shun violence should be the loudest to protest that moral equivalence.

While the political right dreams of fine-tuning tariffs, the Taylor Lorenz left fantasizes about \u201cthis man who\u2019s a revolutionary, who\u2019s famous, who\u2019s handsome . . .\u201d Like Che Guevara, the bloody Communist revolutionary who found immortality as a college-leftist pinup, Mangione mixes sex and violence with a narcissistic radical\u2019s sense of self-righteousness. It\u2019s a brew Lorenz finds intoxicating \u2014 and maybe CNN does, too. Certainly it\u2019s good for buzz. The Trump movement has its emotional and aesthetic side, but it\u2019s channeled into actual politics in GOP primaries and general elections. And its more extravagant expressions are found not in the streets, but in memes and social-media rants. The left is different, increasingly channeling emotion away from candidates and policy disputes and toward street action and violent fantasies \u2014 whether fearful fantasies of a Nazi takeover, or thrilling visions of a murderous uprising against power, or both. Instead of presenting \u201cextreme America\u201d documentaries that treat Trump voters and a murderer\u2019s apologists as essentially the same, CNN would do its viewers a service by showing them the difference between a politically effective right and the dangerously adolescent left. Yet the same sensationalism that sustains Taylor Lorenz may be all CNN knows how to sell, too.

But while most Americans don\u2019t begrudge others from earning their way to their wealth, it\u2019s in the area of income taxation that the divide becomes resentful. Check Out: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth For You: 5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying While many Americans slave away at their jobs and fork over a sizable share of their income to Uncle Sam, there are endless reports of millionaires and billionaires who pay $0 in income tax every year. On the face of it, that sure sounds like an uneven playing field and it contributes to the narrative that \u201cthe rich get richer.\u201d But is it really true that some billionaires really pay no income tax? If so, how do they do it and is it the sign of an unfair system? Read on to explore more. Do Billionaires Really Pay $0 in Income Tax? Most Americans want to avoid paying taxes as much as legally possible. This applies as much to billionaires as to gig workers hustling just to get by. And many lower-income earners do avoid paying income taxes, due to their low wages and available tax deductions and credits. But it is true that some billionaires end up paying $0 in income tax. Read More: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: My Wealthiest Clients All Do These 3 Things In fact, the list of billionaires paying $0 in income tax reads like a who\u2019s-who of the world\u2019s most famous executives. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, for example, are the two wealthiest people in the world, according to the Forbes Billionaires\u2019 List . But in 2007 and 2018, Bezos didn\u2019t pay a dime in federal income tax, even though he was already a multi-billionaire. The same was true in 2018 with Musk. According to ProPublica , however, these two are far from alone. Michael Bloomberg, Carl Icahn and George Soros all managed to avoid paying any federal income taxes at some point in recent years, in some cases multiple times. Overall, according to ProPublica data, the 25 wealthiest Americans paid taxes equal to 3.4% of their wealth gain from 2014 to 2018. Bloomberg paid just 1.3%, while Bezos\u2019 \u201ctrue tax rate\u201d in those years was less than 1%. How Is That Possible? The reason the IRS can\u2019t stop certain billionaires from avoiding income tax is that they are abiding by federal law. The rich aren\u2019t just making up their own rules and getting away scot-free \u2014 they are actually playing by the rules enshrined in the U.S. Tax Code. In fact, at least in principle, the rich avoid taxes the same way those in the lower income brackets do, through the use of deductions and tax credits. But while it\u2019s a fair argument to say that only the rich can avail of some of these more advanced tactics, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re illegal. Story Continues By and large, the seeming discrepancy in taxes between rich and poor comes down to how the wealthy earn their riches. Middle- and lower-class workers get most of the income from wages and salaries, which are fully taxable as ordinary income. The rich, on the other hand, generate most of their earnings through capital growth. Many famous CEOs, from Mark Zuckerberg (Meta Platforms) and Steve Jobs (Apple) to Larry Page (Google) and Meg Whitman (Hewlett-Packard) all accepted a token salary of $1, in part to avoid drawing a huge tax liability. This is obviously an option that most rank-and-file workers can\u2019t accept. Rather than drawing huge salaries, the uber-rich tend to keep their money invested in real estate, the stock market and businesses. When the value of these assets grow, the money isn\u2019t actually taxed unless a sale is made. Thus, the rich can keep getting richer without paying taxes because their assets rise in value. Meanwhile, if they need cash flow to fund their day-to-day living, they can borrow against these assets. While they have to pay interest on these loans, it\u2019s at a much lower rate than the credit card interest rates that the lower classes tend to face. As an added bonus, the money the wealthy take out in the form of loans is not considered income and so it is not taxable. Another advantage billionaires have is that with so many investments, they can use any losses they generate to offset any potential gains. For example, if a billionaire earns a $1 million bonus but invests in a football team that generates operational losses, those losses can offset that income and result in a net-zero tax liability. The same applies to applying capital losses on stocks or other investments to any realized gains. The combination of these factors helps explain why many wealthy people pay very low tax rates and why the IRS can\u2019t stop them.

Then-Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wisc.) and his son Jack, then 12, after a meeting of House Republicans in the Capitol on Nov. 18, 2014. (Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call) A month into President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, Sean Duffy, the newly appointed secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT), issued a memo declaring that \u201cDOT-supported or assisted state contracts shall prioritize projects and goals \u2026 that give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average.\u201d This move by Duffy\u2014who happens to be a father of seven\u2014tying federal transportation spending to birth and marriage rates was characterized as \u201cdisturbingly dystopian\u201d by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and \u201c deeply frightening \u201d by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). Duffy\u2019s directive embraces pronatalism\u2014a once-fringe right-wing ideology that has found a comfortable home in the current administration. (Vice President JD Vance, President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have around 22 kids between them.) Pronatalists believe that having lots of children is an urgent social project\u2014at least for those living in the United States and Europe\u2014in order to \u201c maintain population levels, support economic growth, and preserve cultural and national identities .\u201d And although not usually mentioned in the same breath, pronatalism fits cozily aside the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigrant and antiabortion agenda . The founder of the annual Natal Conference, Kevin Dolan, explained in a podcast interview that while \u201csome of the debates that I hear about natalism is like, \u2018We can\u2019t have natalism, we have too many stupid people in the world\u2019\u2014in my opinion, the only people who are going to respond to our natalism conference [and] conversations are going to be at the higher end of the distribution.\u201d Dolan is making it clear that pronatalist and eugenic positions are not in opposition; they\u2019re very much aligned. Natal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan (right) regularly appears on far-right podcasts. (Screenshot from The Jolly Heretic ) Tickets for the sold-out conference in Austin last month were $10,000 for the weekend , and as reported in Wired , included matchmaking events with the option of an onsite wedding, \u201cas part of their greater effort to repopulate the world.\u201d Unsurprisingly, few women headlined the conference\u2014the movement is not necessarily targeted towards supporting gender equality. In fact, pronatalism is \u201cvery much aligned\u201d with antifeminism, according to the self-proclaimed \u201cdomestic extremist\u201d Peachy Keenan. As she puts it , \u201cFeminism is how the unpopular and undateable cope with life,\u201d and \u201cliberal feminism\u201d is to blame for declining birthrates. Kicking off her remarks at this year\u2019s conference , Keenan reminisced, \u201cWhen I spoke at this conference in 2023, I made the case that the easiest way to raise birthrates was to make motherhood great again. For those of you who only speak NPR, that means convincing America\u2019s uterus-havers to remember that they have uteruses\u2014before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Dismissing Harris voters, whom she characterized as having \u201cPlanned Parenthood punch cards and IUDs cemented to their cervix,\u201d she finds hope for the future in \u201ctrad undergrads \u2026 at a Christian or Catholic College\u201d where \u201cgirls haven\u2019t spent four years getting blow job tutorials on the Call Me Daddy podcast, or in body count competitions with their bisexual polycule.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Pronatalism Comes Home to Roost in the White House While these extreme characters live at the center of this pronatalist movement, it\u2019s critical to understand how these ideas have become central for key administration members who can act on them. JD Vance In 2021, then-Senate candidate JD Vance famously railed that the U.S. was being run by \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\u201d Seeking to dilute the power of the childless, he proposed that \u201cwhen you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power \u2026 than people who don\u2019t have kids\u201d\u2014because, in his mind, Americans without children \u201cdon\u2019t have as much of an investment in the future of this country.\u201d When Vance\u2019s offensive diatribe resurfaced on social media during his 2024 bid for the vice presidency, he acknowledged that the phrasing may have been \u201cdumb\u201d but did not back away from his point: that \u201cour country has become almost pathologically anti-child.\u201d While Vance may have cleaned up his language a bit\u2014by dropping epithets like \u201cderanged,\u201d \u201csociopathic\u201d and \u201cpathological\u201d (his previous insults for childfree Americans)\u2014his pro-baby enthusiasm is still going strong. Notably, he took advantage of his first speech as VP to proclaim, \u201c I want more babies in the United States of America \u201d\u2014a message he reiterated shortly thereafter at the 2025 March for Life, an annual antiabortion rally in Washington. Donald Trump During his bid for a second term, Trump announced in his speech at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference that he \u201cwill support baby bonuses for a new baby boom. How does that sound? I want a baby boom .\u201d This exhortation was immediately followed by him telling the men in the audience how lucky they were\u2014three separate times. (This is better left unpacked.) When a crowd gathered at the March 2025 White House event celebrating women\u2019s history\u2014which, as described in The Guardian , \u201cconsisted of the sort of women Trump approves of: very white, and very deferential\u201d\u2014Trump dubbed himself the \u201c Fertilization President .\u201d This creepy moniker apparently came to him following his announcement that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna have tremendous goodies in the bag for women too.\u201d According to The Cut , the \u201ctremendous goodies\u201d is an apparent reference to the \u201c glorified press release \u201d announcing his plans for increasing access to IVF to push for \u201cmore babies and expanding American families.\u201d Elon Musk Compared to Trump and Vance, Musk most brazenly identifies with the pronatalism movement. According to Emma Waters , a member of the conservative Heritage Foundation, Musk is \u201ca fearless ally and legitimizing force\u201d behind its pro-baby agenda. Giving voice to this commitment, in 2022, he tweeted , \u201cPopulation collapse due to low birth rates is a much greater risk to civilization than global warming.\u201d Echoing Vance\u2019s sentiments, he more recently tweeted , \u201cInstead of teaching fear of pregnancy, we should teach fear of childlessness.\u201d Elon Musk speaks to employees at the Tesla Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg on March 13, 2024, while carrying his child on his shoulders. (Carsten Koall / Getty Images) As Waters and others have written, Musk is closely associated with the elite \u201ctech-bro\u201d wing of the pronatalist movement. As she explains, in contrast to \u201cpro-family natalists\u201d who encourage \u201cpeople to view children as an extension of marriage in which children may be received as a gift,\u201d Silicon Valley natalists \u201ctend to promote, in practice if not in speech, a selective pronatalism: More babies of a certain kind .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Many of these pronatalist tech bros have poured money into the fertility technology industry to help ensure \u201ctheir future children are the healthiest, smartest, and best potential children they can be.\u201d The official Twitter account of the Natal Conference has a tweet reply to Elon Musk pinned at the top of its feed. Antiabortion Extremism and Pronatalism While not all natalists are against abortion , many\u2014especially the critical administrative trio \u2014are fiercely antiabortion. An ongoing legal challenge to the FDA\u2019s approved distribution of the abortion drug mifepristone exemplifies this nexus. It also highlights the interests of the state in promoting population growth, which necessarily translates into its interest in controlling women\u2019s reproductive bodies. In 2024, The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the antiabortion group, Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (AHM), lacked standing to sue the FDA over its approval because AHM was not harmed by these actions. A lower court effectively allowed the states of Missouri, Kansas and Idaho to take over the case, based on their claim that \u201csince each abortion represents at least one potential or actual birth\u201d resulting in a potential decline in birth rates, the dispensing of mifepristone has caused \u201csovereign injuries to [to their] population interests.\u201d As we have seen, pronatalism is imbued both with eugenical significance and misogynistic assumptions about women\u2019s essential maternal nature and obligations. Therefore, it is deeply troubling to see it invoked by these states to promote antiabortion sentiment. Moreover, as Rolonda Donelson powerfully observed in a recent National Partnership for Women & Families blog post , it is problematic to cast abortion as a legally cognizable source of injury when \u201cthe truth is that those declines are much more likely caused by the states themselves \u2026 and their policy shortcomings.\u201d Thus, \u201ccharacterizing abortion as a \u2018harm\u2019 to the state increases misogyny and refuses to hold states accountable for the failures they have caused by not providing social support to children and families already in existence.\u201d This blame-shifting strategy draws attention away from the fact that abortion-restrictive states also \u201cfail to provide social safety net programs that allow children and families to thrive,\u201d which has a disparate impact on marginalized and vulnerable communities. Clearly, the pronatalist movement has gone beyond the confines of the once-tiny Natal Conference and has found a true home in the current administration. And we should be chilled by the prospect that federal spending may well be deployed as an instrument to advance the so-called Fertility President\u2019s appeal for a baby boom.

EcoFlow expands lineup with up to 65% off power stations during second phase of Mega Sale starting from $119 EcoFlow has shifted to the second phase of its ongoing Mega Sale through April 25 , with up to 65% taken off power stations and solar generator bundles, complete with extra savings, EcoCredit rewards, and upcoming flash sale offers. One returning bundle that is dropping lower than ever is the DELTA Pro Portable Power Station that comes with two 220W solar panels and a protective bag for $2,279.05 shipped , after using the code 25EFMFAFF at checkout for a bonus 5% off. Normally fetching $5,096 at full price, we\u2019ve seen this same bundle go as low as $2,374 in past sales, which is getting beaten out here today. With the bonus savings you\u2019ll be scoring $2,817 off the going rate here, which lands the package down at the lowest rate we have seen to date. Before we jump into the specifics of our headlining deal, let\u2019s go over the bonuses we\u2019re seeing during this Mega Sale\u2019s second phase . First, while you would normally have to spend at least $2,500 to score the automatic 5% in extra savings, you can instead score it on orders under that amount thanks to the exclusive code 25EFMFAFF at checkout. From there, you\u2019ll bump that amount to 7% off automatically on orders of $5,000 or more. There are some exceptions though, which you can get the full list of by hovering over the extra savings sections on the page. We\u2019re also seeing the continued EcoCredit rewards here, with 3x the EcoCredits from purchases for standard members and 3.5x EcoCredits for Plus members. Advertisement - scroll for more content The EcoFlow DELTA Pro is one of the most popular and expansive options for backup power support from the brand, with this solar generator kit being quite the start-up for your needs that can be further invested in and built up over time. The LiFePO4 batteries start with a 3,600Wh capacity that you can further expand up to 25kWh with future investments in add-on equipment. Its 14 ports dish out 3,600W of power output, which will cover most appliances, with things surging up to 7,200W to ensure essential devices stay running. Plugging the power station into a wall outlet will have the station\u2019s battery recharged in 1.8 hours, or you can refill its capacity in 2.8 hours should you have the maximum 1,600W of solar input available (with the 440W here obviously taking more time). Keeping track of its settings and monitoring charging statuses doesn\u2019t have to keep you nearby either, as the companion app gives you the full array of remote smart controls you\u2019d expect, it just takes a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. ***Note: The 5% sitewide coupon has not been factored in to the prices below, make sure to enter the code 25EFMFAFF at checkout to score the maximum savings!

Hiboy launches new cargo-capable U2 Pro e-scooter with a 34-mile range and 25MPH top speed at $900 ($600 off) Running as part of its Easter Sale , Hiboy is launching its brand new U2 Pro Electric Scooter with a significant discount to $899.98 shipped along with a handy free device for its upkeep. This all-new commuting solution will carry a $1,500 price tag normally, but it\u2019s hitting the ground today with the very first chance at cash savings here. You\u2019ll be getting a 40% markdown while these savings last, cutting $600 from the tag and setting the bar for future deals down the road. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll even be getting some free gear too, as it comes with a 2-in-1 tire inflator and vacuum device that is valued at $70. Hiboy\u2019s new U2 Pro Electric Scooter is cruising onto the scene with a sitting-oriented design that carries a 265-pound payload, as opposed to the usual standing frames we see from the brand. The 750W motor here peaks up to 810W in order to tackle inclines up to 20 degrees, delivering a top speed of 25 MPH. The 48V 13Ah battery provides enough juice to carry you for up to 34 miles on a single charge, with a 3.5-inch thick memory foam seat for added comfort during your journey. The whole thing comes with an IPX4 water-resistance rating that protects it from light rain, humid conditions, and other situations where it may be splashed with water. This cargo-capable e-scooter comes with a larger footboard, which you could secure groceries or even a pet carrier to while also sporting an integrated rear cargo rack that can be further used for packages or to carry a passenger thanks to the inclusion of a removable cushioned seat. Among its other stock features, you\u2019ll find 16-inch all-terrain snow tires that maximize grip on whatever surface your riding along, as well as a 125mm rear suspension, dual 160mm disc brakes, a 70 lux headlight, a break-activated taillight, a twist throttle, a key ignition, conveniently integrated controls along the left handlebar, and a large 7-inch display for real-time information at a glance. Hiboy has added a banner to its main site stating that it will be increasing prices in the future, so be sure to check out the full lineup of deals in its Easter Sale while costs are still kept this low. Goal Zero\u2019s Sherpa 100AC 25,600mAh 100W 5-port wireless AC power bank accompanies you anywhere at $200 By way of its official Amazon storefront, Goal Zero is offering a chance to score its Sherpa 100AC 25,600mAh 100W Wireless AC Power Bank at $199.89 shipped . This model, which is one of the few we\u2019ve seen sporting an actual AC port, has been more recently keeping to $250 after falling from its original $300 MSRP back in 2024. While we did see it go as low as $177 during Black Friday and Christmas sales, it\u2019s mostly stayed above $210 over the last year, with today\u2019s deal providing a solid $50 markdown that lands it at the fourth-lowest price we have tracked \u2013 $23 above the low. Coming in a durable anodized aluminum form factor with impact bumpers along its edges, the airline-approved Goal Zero Sherpa 100AC has been designed to accompany you anywhere while also being packed with a significant amount of port options for juicing up your essential devices. It totes a 25,600Wh capacity and among its many output options, you\u2019ll find a 100W AC port that can surge up to 150W, a 100W USB-C port, a secondary 60W USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and it even provides 15W wireless charging to your smartphone. It can recharge its own battery at up to 60W speeds, taking two hours via a wall outlet while also providing up to 50W solar-charging capabilities that will refill the battery in three to six hours. If you\u2019re not really in need of the AC port option in the above model, you can save a bit more by going with Goal Zero\u2019s counterpart Sherpa 100PD model for $159.89 shipped , down from $200. You\u2019ll be getting much of the same performance capabilities for output charging and input recharging, with the difference here being fewer ports, specifically two USB-C ports and a 60W in/100W out USB-C port, as well as the 15W wireless charging.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Fox News Digital was also No. 1 among competitive news brands in multiplatform views, driving 2.2 billion to grow by 34% compared to last year. It was the fourth-highest month of all time for Fox News Digital in the category and the 11th consecutive month at No. 1 among the news competitive set. Fox News Digital was also No. 1 in average views per visit among news brands, with 2.7 average views per visit. Fox News Digital finished March with 129 million total multiplatform unique visitors, a 20% increase compared to last year. It was Fox News Digital\u2019s third-best month ever in the metric. FOXBusiness.com delivered a record 939 million multiplatform minutes to beat CNBC for the quarter. Fox News was once again the most engaged brand on social media among news brands during the first quarter, with 245.3 million total social interactions, according to Emplifi. It was the 43rd consecutive quarter that Fox News finished on top. Fox News drove 144 million interactions on Facebook, up 725% versus the first quarter of 2024, 84.5 million Instagram interactions, up 82% compared to last year and 10.8 million X interactions, for a 68% increase. FOX NEWS CHANNEL MAKES HISTORY WITH HIGHEST-RATED QUARTER IN HISTORY AMONG WEEKDAY VIEWERS Fox News finished the first quarter of 2025 with over one billion video views on YouTube for its best quarter in history, according to Emplifi. (KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images;Robert Michael/picture alliance via Getty Images) Fox News also finished the first quarter of 2025 with over 1 billion video views on YouTube for its best quarter in history, according to Emplifi. Fox News finished the historic quarter as the No. 1 news brand on YouTube with a staggering 1.2 billion views. It was the second consecutive quarter that Fox News finished atop the news competitive set, surpassing the nearest competitor, MSNBC\u2019s 945 million views, by 26%. The digital success comes as Fox News Channel had the highest-rated quarter among weekday total viewers in cable news history during the first quarter of 2025, also topping broadcast competition in key measurables along the way. Fox News Digital, CBS News, NBC News, The Washington Post and ABC News have opted in to account for Social Incremental in total digital multiplatform unique visitors, while brands like CNN and The New York Times have not opted in.

Light, efficient for its carrying capacity. Can charge fast at Tesla Superchargers, despite high-voltage architecture. TIRED Not the cheapest 7-seat EV SUV by far. Advanced driving features still arriving. Will Americans take to its design? North Americans love their SUVs. Minivans, not so much\u2014despite wanting ever-larger vehicles that hold more people and more stuff. They also increasingly like electric cars , though not at the most optimistic rates projected a few years ago, in part because EVs are still pricier to buy. All of which leaves the 2026 Lucid Gravity, the second vehicle from startup Lucid Motors, in a peculiar position. It\u2019s a battery-electric crossover utility with an EPA range of up to 450 miles, a prodigious 120 cubic feet of interior volume (including the front trunk) for the five-seat model, and a second row that folds flat. Want sixth and seventh seats? A third row that vanishes below the cargo floor takes away only 5.6 cubic feet. There\u2019s fast charging that, under ideal circumstances, can add 200 miles of range in 11 minutes. But the launch Grand Touring model of the Gravity starts at $95,000\u2014and our test car, with 10 separate options, stickered at a cool $125K. Courtesy of Lucid Motors The Gravity hardly has the appearance of the rock-climbing, desert-crossing, rough-and-tough SUV. Instead, the 2026 Gravity is a sleek, relatively low, highly efficient, smartly engineered and packaged people carrier that has elements of minivan to it\u2014or, even worse in US terms, a \u201cwagon.\u201d It\u2019s the antithesis of the \u201celectric Land Rover\u201d ethos of the Rivian R1S , which has all those butch points but weighs 1,000-plus more pounds. WIRED spent a day and more than 100 miles with a recent 2025 Gravity Grand Touring up-fitted with all changes found in the 2026 models now rolling off the lines at Lucid\u2019s expanded factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. We were greatly impressed. \u201cBoost\u201d to Charge Fast at Superchargers Lucid has long been known for the elegance of its compact, efficient power units. Combining an electric motor of up to 1,000 horsepower, its power electronics, and a final-drive unit in a package little bigger than an Army footlocker is far from easy. As it turned out, the Gravity got a new rear power unit at the last minute. While the basic shape of the Gravity was fixed a couple of years ago, the EV world was rocked when Tesla agreed in May 2023 to let Ford EVs charge in its \u201cwalled garden\u201d Supercharger network. GM followed two weeks later. By autumn 2023, it was evident that any future EV sold in North America would have to incorporate the NACS charging connector sooner or later. In early 2024, Lucid decided to build NACS into all Gravitys from the start. That brought them face-to-face with a charging problem: Lucid uses a high-voltage battery pack (926 volts), one of the few makers (Porsche and E-GMP models from Hyundai-Kia are the others) to have batteries running at more than 800 volts. But Tesla\u2019s Version 3 Superchargers, the bulk of its network today, use a low-voltage, high-current system. Hyundai owners have reported charge rates as low as 50 to 80 kilowatts in cars capable of 300 kW or more. Lucid Gravity 2026 Rating: 9/10 $79,900 at Lucid If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. So Lucid developed a proprietary \u201cboost\u201d technology\u2014it declined to give WIRED precise details\u2014to raise incoming 500-volt power to match the pack\u2019s 926 volts. It says only that it uses the rear motor unit to do so, presumably through one of the windings acting as a DC-DC inverter. The boost function delivers up to 225 kW from a v3 Supercharger. Lucid also moved the Gravity\u2019s charge-port door from the left-front fender to the left rear, just as it is today on Tesla cars\u2014allowing the Gravity to use current Tesla v3 Superchargers with their characteristically short cables. While two preproduction cars at the drive event had both ports, any Gravity you can buy comes with a NACS connector\u2014along with a CCS-NACS adapter. And, laudably, the company worked with Tesla to do the software integration that allows proper Plug and Charge at Tesla chargers: plug in the car, walk away, and all the authentication and billing is done on the back end, automatically. Keeping 12-Volt Batteries Healthy Another electrical trick: The Gravity uses a \u201cMicro DC-DC converter\u201d to trickle-charge the Gravity\u2019s 12-volt batteries from the traction battery rather than recharging them only periodically. That greatly extends the life of any 12-volt battery, a century-old technology not designed for regular deep discharges before recharging. Why two 12V batteries? For redundancy, so it can park safely at the side of the road even if one battery is damaged in a crash. Lucid says the Gravity\u2019s sensor suite\u201412 exterior and two interior cameras, 5 radars, one lidar, and 12 ultrasonic sensors\u2014 will \u201cenable Level 3 autonomy,\u201d it\u2019s still rolling out certain of its premium ADAS features via over-the-air updates. The full feature set of DreamDrive 2 Pro is planned for a fall delivery; that includes not only hands-free enhanced cruise control, but also the unique \u201cCurb Rash Alert\u201d to sound an alarm if a driver is in danger of scraping a wheel on a curb. Not a Butch SUV, but What Is It? EV design sometimes takes advantage of the packaging opportunities, with a short beveled nose and a longer cabin (see the Tesla Model 3 , Jaguar I-Pace ). Other makers (like BMW) shy away from anything that suggests their EVs aren\u2019t \u201cregular\u201d cars, meaning proportions that could house a combustion engine up front. Lucid sits firmly in the first camp. The rear doors are huge, access to the third row is as easy as any vehicle we\u2019ve tested, and a 6'6\" colleague was able to climb into that third row and sit with some semblance of comfort. Courtesy of Lucid Motors Courtesy of Lucid Motors It\u2019s all about the drag, or more precisely, lessening it to every last possible degree to wring greater range out of a given battery capacity. Lucid quotes a drag coefficient of 0.24, remarkable for a vehicle this large\u2014though Cd figures from different makers can\u2019t be compared due to varying methods of measurement. Combined with a remarkably light weight of just 6,000 pounds (thanks to aluminum construction), the slippery design produces an efficiency of up to 3.6 miles/kWh (450 miles from a 123-kWh pack). It varies with wheel size (smaller is better) and passenger configuration (five seats is better than seven). Drives Smaller Than It Is Our vehicle, the seven-seat model with 20- and 21-inch wheels (front and rear), showed just 2.22 miles/kWh after an energetic drive through the foothills of Los Olivos, California. But our driving was hardly typical of the wealthy suburbanite-family duties the Gravity will most likely see. We did some acceleration runs, took it briefly to extra-legal speeds on limited-access highways, and cycled regularly among the three drive modes: Smooth (normal), Swift (sport), and Sprint (fastest). Smooth gave a slightly busy ride, while Swift felt more controlled and precise. Sprint was the most \u201cGerman\u201d of the three. We mostly toggled between the last two, but the differences among them were more subtle and much less pronounced than in other EVs WIRED has driven. Lucid Gravity 2026 Rating: 9/10 $79,900 at Lucid If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. The optional rear-wheel steering makes the Gravity easy to place, and it drives smaller than its dimensions might suggest. At 198 inches long, it\u2019s the same size as a Rivian R1S or BMW X7, but drivers will be aware of its 87-inch width (mirror to mirror) when facing oncoming traffic on narrow mountain roads. With a total power output of 618 kW (828 hp) and torque of 909 pound feet, acceleration from 0 to 60 mph is quoted at a remarkable 3.4 seconds in Sprint mode. We didn\u2019t do repeated stopwatch testing, but that seemed close to the mark, albeit delivered in a remarkably unfussed manner. Tesla\u2019s characteristic, explosive kick-you-in-the-kidneys thrust off the line is absent here. Being an SUV in America, of course, the Gravity has to tow. It\u2019s rated for up to 6,000 pounds, with Tow Mode and vehicle-control software that takes into account trailer behavior. If you do what Lucid showed in its publicity shots and tow a smaller Airstream behind a Gravity, that range of up to 450 miles may be cut in half while towing, if other EVs are any guide. Courtesy of Lucid Motors Courtesy of Lucid Motors Off-roading? Ride height varies from 5.3 to 9.3 inches, courtesy of the air suspension. The highest number approaches Subaru levels, but it\u2019s hardly the 16 inches of a GMC Hummer EV in Extract mode. While Rivian took reporters rock-climbing over 12,000 feet for its debut launch, the Lucid team let reporters do doughnuts in soft sand (with the traction control off) and autocross the big seven-seater through a sandy paddock course (it did quite well for its size, but it\u2019s no Miata). More than a year ago, I drove an alpha-build Gravity and was impressed by its road behavior. Last week, we learned its powertrain came from an earlier Lucid Air and wasn\u2019t the one used in production Gravity models on sale today. That speaks to Lucid\u2019s relentless spirit of refinement and improvement\u2014specifically, a new rear power unit in just a year. Processor Headroom The Lucid team laid out the software-defined vehicle platform it used for the Air and how it had been updated for the Gravity. One aspect is the use of the latest Nvidia Orin-X processor, with 512 GB of onboard storage. The current Gravity code base occupies roughly 100 GB, said acting digital vice president JP Gaultier, leaving plenty of room for the substantial code to achieve higher levels of autonomy. Courtesy of Lucid Motors Lucid Gravity 2026 Rating: 9/10 $79,900 at Lucid If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Another advance: The Gravity is the first Lucid without old-style fuses, meaning devices in sockets. While the Air mixed some of those with electronically resettable e-fuses, the Gravity has solely e-fuses. Since they never have to be removed, the vehicle needn\u2019t include access panels or fuse boxes at all. Verdict The Gravity lets Lucid offer a \u201cTesla done right\u201d SUV to an audience that may be tiring of the latter company\u2019s increasingly stale lineup. In our one day, the Gravity established itself as a smartly designed, extremely capable, and eminently pleasant place to rack up the miles. Sure, if Lucid had it to do over again, it may have started with an SUV. But the Air luxury sedan was a great proof of concept, and it put the company on the map as a serious new entrant in the EV startup space\u2014albeit a US company now largely funded by Saudi backing. The worry about the Gravity is that it\u2019s not a classic SUV, and it offers only minimal off-road chops. It\u2019s almost a European style \u201cpeople mover,\u201d or the dreaded M-word: minivan. Both those vehicle types are far more practical than taller, tougher-looking SUVs, even if US buyers often don\u2019t accept that. Lucid said other, less expensive trim levels of the Gravity will follow the high-end Grand Touring we tested. The Touring will arrive by the end of this year, and a rear-wheel drive Pure model and a supercar Sapphire trim may follow, to parallel the Air lineup. To let more shoppers in on the clear virtues of Gravity, bring on those less-expensive Gravity models\u2014and then, smaller, more affordable Lucids, ASAP.

Every year, Tesla releases a huge Spring Update that brings new features. Version 2015.14 rolling out is this update. One notable highlight for Apple users? Tesla owners can now shuffle Apple Music playlists that have more than 100 songs. Before, the shuffle feature didn\u2019t work on larger playlists, which frustrated users who rely on longer mixes during drives. This tweak is part of a batch of \u201cminor updates\u201d in Tesla\u2019s Spring Update, which also includes improvements like a wider rear camera view, faster media searches, and auto-connecting Wi-Fi hotspots. The update also brings new trip planning options, lets you avoid highways in navigation, and adds more dashcam features \u2014 but for drivers who stream music on the road, the Apple Music upgrade might be the most noticeable change. There\u2019s now also an option to automatically enable Sentry Mode (the Tesla camera recording feature) when parked. This looks to thwart people who continue to vandalize Tesla vehicles because of their hatred towards Elon Musk. Here are the major feature updates in the 2025.14 Tesla Spring software update (via Tesla North ): Choose between Fastest, Best Amenities, or Fewer Stops for trip planning. New option to avoid highways in navigation settings. Side cameras now record to Dashcam and Sentry Mode. Dashcam Viewer updated with a grid view for easier clip review.

Sean Michael Newhouse | April 14, 2025 Contracting RIFs DOGE Diversity The First 100 Days Sean Michael Newhouse Staff Reporter Labor Department employees who enforce equal opportunity requirements for federal contractors have until 6 p.m. Monday to decide whether to take an offer to leave federal service, as their agency faces the possibility of almost total elimination with remaining staff being directed to unwind their past work. Deferred Resignation 2.0 Workers at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, as well as the International Labor Affairs Bureau, Women\u2019s Bureau and Office of Public Affairs, received an email late on April 4 that they were eligible for a second round of the deferred resignation program . Under the initiative, DOL employees can keep their pay and benefits through Sept. 30 if they resign by April 14. The message also said eligible staff could utilize the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority by the same deadline in order to retire by the end of the calendar year. Government Executive has previously reported on an internal February DOL memo in which officials proposed slashing OFCCP\u2019s workforce by 90% (reducing the number of employees from nearly 500 to 50) and cutting the number of regional and field offices from 54 to four. \u201cEmployees are worried about their livelihoods, that they're being pushed out of their jobs and not given options [and] not given enough time to make real-life decisions for their families,\u201d said one OFCCP employee who preferred to be unnamed due to fears of retaliation. \u201cIt just don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re sending things and doing things in good faith.\u201d What is OFCCP? The agency was responsible for enforcing : Executive Order 11246 , a 1965 presidential directive that established antidiscrimination requirements for federal contractors and subcontractors. Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federal contracting. The Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 , which requires federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to employ and advance certain veterans. Former OFCCP Director Jenny R. Yang, who also served as chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said the agency\u2019s audits of contractors helped expose unnoticed issues. \u201cBecause workers see federal government investigators right there saying \u2018We want to do something about it,\u2019 people start to open up, and we learn about problems that never would have been reported,\u201d she said. In 2020, OFCCP secured a \u200b\u200b$3.5 million early resolution conciliation \u200b\u200b agreement with Newport News Shipbuilding , the sole designer, builder and refueler of Navy aircraft carriers, to resolve allegations of systematic hiring discrimination without having to go to litigation. Under the agreement, the company distributed $3.5 million in back pay and interest to more than 4,400 affected Black applicants who weren\u2019t hired for certain positions. The company denied it discriminated against applicants during its hiring process. The next year, the agency reached a $3.8 million settlement with Google to resolve allegations of systemic compensation and hiring discrimination affecting female and Asian software engineers at certain facilities. This settlement was the result of a routine compliance evaluation, and Google denied wrongdoing. Trump Changes On the second day of his second term, President Donald Trump repealed EO 11246, one of the three mandates that OFCCP enforced. His directive also required OFCCP to stop promoting \u201cdiversity\u201d and upholding contractor affirmative action programs. As a result, many OFCCP audits were halted, including one at Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla . Musk is the de facto leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has overseen recent personnel and spending cuts across federal agencies. Trump on March 24 named Catherine Eschbach as the agency\u2019s new director. Most recently, she worked at a law firm where she represented Musk\u2019s company SpaceX in a case involving the National Labor Relations Board. In an email to staff on the day of her appointment, Eschbach said the agency would be \u201cright-siz[ed]\u201d and reduce its \u201cphysical geographic footprint.\u201d She also acknowledged the repealed executive order and said officials would closely examine the agency\u2019s responsibilities under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act and VEVRAA, which she mistakenly referred to as \u201cVERRA.\u201d \u201cThe reality is, most of what OFCCP had been doing was out of step, if not flat out contradictory, to our country\u2019s laws, and all reform options are on the table to bring OFCCP into compliance with its constitutional and statutory bounds,\u201d she wrote. The OFCCP employee said the email was not well received by staff. \u201cWe were all offended by the email,\u201d they said. \u201cTo me, it seemed hateful.\u201d New Orders In Eschbach\u2019s March 24 email, she said that the agency will need to verify that all federal contractors have eliminated their affirmative action programs within 91 days of the rescission of EO 11246. Trump repealed that order on Jan. 21, meaning such work should be completed on or around April 22. OFCCP employees that Government Executive spoke to, however, said they haven\u2019t received specific instructions about what tasks they should be performing. DOL did not respond to a request for comment. The email also said the agency would examine contractors\u2019 previously submitted affirmative action plans to determine if there\u2019s evidence of \u201clongstanding unlawful discrimination\u201d and, as part of an effort to deter diversity, equity and inclusion programs, identify potential civil compliance investigations of corporations, non-profits and higher education institutions. Related articles Contractors face greater scrutiny from anti-DEI executive orders \u201cThis administration is trying to use the full force of government to intimidate employers into backing away unnecessarily from important efforts that are needed to advance equal opportunity,\u201d Yang said. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, led an April 11 letter signed by 38 congressional Democrats to Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, urging her to reverse course on OFCCP. \u201cFor decades, OFCCP has worked effectively to prevent and address unlawful discrimination by investigating individual complaints from workers and by proactively reviewing federal contractors\u2019 employment practices,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis unique power to proactively review whether employers were complying with the law allowed OFCCP to identify discrimination that might have otherwise gone unreported or undiscovered.\u201d One OFCCP employee, who preferred to be unnamed due to fears of retaliation, said that weakening the agency removes a resource for federal contract employees. \u201cWho can they reach out to to ensure that when they have an issue, whether they\u2019re individuals with disabilities or they\u2019re a protected veteran, who can they reach out to if OFCCP is to be dismantled?\u201d the employee said. The other OFCCP employee said that the agency\u2019s apparent near elimination feels like a betrayal. \u201cWe love our jobs. I served in the military. I'm a disabled veteran, and I worked hard to get to where I am. I feel like our country is turning its back on us,\u201d the employee said. \u201cWe're civil servants.

By Emily Forlini Apr 15, 2025 (Credit: Tesla) Wireless charging technology has come a long way in recent years, especially for mobile phones. It's still not available for electric cars, but some of the biggest companies working on the tech are making major changes that could bring it to market. WiTricity, one of the highest-profile startups in EV charging, is shifting its focus to electric golf carts and \"neighborhood electric vehicles,\" or carts used for off-course transport. The company also named a new CEO, Joe Benz, and moved its headquarters from Massachusetts to Georgia. The company currently offers one wireless charger for golf carts, the WiTricity MR/1. It's \"being carried by at least three major US-based companies,\" a spokesperson tells us. \"We brought it to market due to overwhelming demand after talking with cart owners and manufacturers. The shift to electric powered vehicles in this market segment is happening much faster than in the passenger car segment and we are excited to serve this market.\" The MR/1 is \"a derivative\" of the prototype EV charging tech we covered in 2024 , which powered up a Ford Mustang Mach-E with no significant loss in energy compared to plug-in home chargers, a common critique of wireless charging. Rendering of a golf cart parking over a wireless charging pad. (Credit: WiTricity) WiTricity is still developing charging pads for passenger vehicles. In the past, it's reportedly prototyped with major brands like BMW, Toyota, and Hyundai. Lately, its sights are set on wireless charging for commercial and autonomous vehicles. \"A vehicle is not truly 'autonomous' if it requires human intervention for charging,\" WiTricity says. (Tesla has a similar idea\u2014more on that below.) Wireless charging could also facilitate the adoption of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, where EVs act as mobile power grids. It's hard to say what the evolving strategy portends for EV drivers hoping to get their hands on the tech soon. It could help popularize and improve it in real-world conditions, but also suggests longer, uncertain timelines for using it on full-size vehicles. Luckily, wireless charging is a \"nice to have\" at this point and not essential.

At the robotaxi reveal event in October, CEO Elon Musk said the company's fully autonomous vehicles would have wireless charging, or inductive charging, as he referred to it: \"That's kind of how it should be. It's really high time we did this,\" Musk said. A week later, the company tweeted a video of its wireless charging pad prototype, which looks similar to WiTricity's solution. It goes on the ground and the car drives over it. Ironically, Tesla's wireless charging history starts with WiTricity, which licensed its intellectual property to Wiferon, the German wireless EV charging supplier that Tesla acquired in July 2023. Tesla's robotaxi business kicks off in June in Austin with existing Model 3 and Y EVs, though we don't expect to see any wireless charging pads in the beginning. Tesla is exploring wireless charging solutions for its next-gen V4 Superchargers. Its VP of engineering, Lars Moravy, hinted at \"more interesting charging paths that we'll launch shortly,\" in a February interview with the Ride the Lightning podcast. \"Why would you have a plug? Isn't there a different way to charge?\" he says to the host, who questions whether installing charging pads would be an infrastructure challenge. \"Could be. But we're making some smart plays about that with the new V4 Supechargers,\" Moravy responds. That's all we know for now. Photos of the V4 Superchargers do not show any wireless charging features, but perhaps they have some hidden components that could beam electricity to future vehicles equipped with a receiver.

Written by Sabrina Ortiz, Senior Editor April 16, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET Following the recent launch of a new family of GPT-4.1 models , OpenAI released o3 and o4-mini on Wednesday, the latest addition to its existing line of reasoning models . The o3 model, previewed in December, is OpenAI's most advanced reasoning model to date, while o4-mini is a smaller, cheaper, and faster model. Meet o3 and o4-mini Simply put, reasoning models are trained to \"think before they speak,\" meaning they take more time to process the prompt but provide higher-quality responses. As a result, like older models, o3 and o4-mini show strong and even improved performance in coding, math, and science tasks. However, they also have an important new addition: visual understanding. Also: How to use ChatGPT: A beginner's guide to the most popular AI chatbot OpenAI o3 and o4-mini are OpenAI's first models to \"think with images.\" OpenAI explains that this means the models don't just see an image; they can actually use the visual information in their reasoning process. Users can also now upload images that are low quality or blurry, and the model will still be able to understand them. Another major first is that o3 and o4-mini can independently or agentically use all ChatGPT tools, including web browsing , Python , image understanding, and image generation , to better resolve complex, multi-step problems. OpenAI says this ability allows the new models to take \"a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT that can independently execute tasks on your behalf.\" Also: The top 20 AI tools of 2025 - and the #1 thing to remember when you use them In the livestream launching the models, the team explained that the same way a person may use a calculator to deliver better results, the new models can now employ all of OpenAI's advanced tools to deliver better results. For example, in a demo, the researcher fed a scientific research poster to o3. He prompted it to analyze the image and draw a conclusion that wasn't included in the poster. To get the answer, o3 knew to browse the internet and zoomed into the image's different elements to generate a conclusive answer, showcasing both its ability to use multiple tools on its own and to analyze images in detail. Screenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET According to OpenAI, the o3 and o4-mini models are better overall than the previous generations, with improved instruction following and more useful verifiable responses. On benchmarks across the board, the new models outperformed their predecessors even without using the additional tools they have access to. You can see a quick glimpse below, or visit the blog post for a closer look. Screenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET A recent report from The Information claimed the new models would synthesize information from different fields and subject expertise and then use that knowledge to suggest new, innovative experiments. Insider sources who have tested the model said these experiments would encompass many complex topics, such as nuclear fission or pathogen detection, according to the report. OpenAI has yet to directly comment on this. How to access the new models OpenAI o3 and o4-mini are available today to subscribers, including ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users . The models will appear in the model picker as o3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-high, replacing o1, o3-mini, and o3-mini-high. Pro users will be able to access o3-pro in a few weeks, but until then, they will still have access to o1-pro. The models are also available for developers via the API. Also: ChatGPT just made it easy to find and edit all the AI images you've ever generated To ease concerns about model safety, OpenAI shared that both of the new releases were stress-tested under its safety program and evaluated under its updated Preparedness Framework . To find the details of the evaluations, you can read the complete system card . Bonus: Codex CLI OpenAI has also launched Codex CLI, an open-source coding agent that runs locally in users' terminals. It is meant to provide users with a simple and clear way to connect AI models, including o3 and o4-mini (with support for GPT-4.1 coming soon), to their own code and tasks running on their computer. Codex CLI is open-source, and you can access it on GitHub now. Also: OpenAI to launch AI models that can think up their own experiments, says report OpenAI also announced the launch of a $1 million initiative. It's meant to support early projects by awarding grants in $25K increments via API credits. Proposals can be submitted via this form on the OpenAI site . Want more stories about AI?

Marjorie Taylor Greene's ex-husband was ordered to attend an Islamic sermon in a settlement for harassing three women from his Tesla Cybertruck last month. On March 30, Perry Greene was captured delivering a minutes-long, profanity-laced tirade at three Muslim college women while they prayed in a parking garage in Alpharetta, Georgia. \"Because you're worshipping a false god,\" Greene stated when asked by one of the women why he had a problem. \"Because y'all are pieces of s--t,\" he continued in a clip circulating on X . \"Go back to your country.

The round included DVx Ventures, the company creation platform run by former Tesla president Jon McNeill, and Madrona Ventures, a three-decade-old venture capital firm known for backing transformative AI startups and iconic companies like Amazon, Snowflake, and Smartsheet. Atomic was founded by Michael Rossiter and Neal Suidan, who experienced the challenges of supply chain planning first-hand as leaders in Tesla\u2019s supply chain and demand planning team. The inspiration came during Tesla\u2019s Model 3 launch in 2018, when they realized how dependent the team was on unwieldy spreadsheets that could not keep up with the speed of changes at the business. The necessities of scaling led them to build Tesla\u2019s end-to-end supply chain orchestration system from scratch. With Atomic, the team set out to solve the same challenges of supply planning for all companies that sell physical goods with an approach that can be rapidly deployed and generalized to any type of supply chain. \u201cOur vision is to ensure every physical good is actively managed,\u201d said Neal Suidan, Founder and CEO, Atomic. \u201cPlanners are the unsung heroes of consumer brands, holding together supply chains through spreadsheets and sheer force of will. But they deserve better tools. We built Atomic to be the inventory planning system we always wished we had. With the support of DVx and Madrona, we\u2019re scaling quickly to bring this technology to more brands, helping them move beyond spreadsheets and into the future of AI-powered inventory management. I\u2019m Sick of this Sheet! Trillions of dollars are tied up in slow-moving and poorly planned inventories in the U.S. alone. The vast majority of inventory decisions \u2014 even at the largest companies \u2014 are still made using spreadsheets, which are error-prone and slow to update, and difficult to scale. This leads to missed sales, bloated inventory levels, and eroded confidence in supply chain operations. Existing supply chain planning software often forces lengthy, high-cost implementations and rigid systems that drive planners back to spreadsheets. \u201cWhat Atomic is doing reminds me of Tesla\u2019s approach to breaking down barriers \u2013 taking something slow and inefficient and replacing it with speed and intelligence,\u201d said Jon McNeill, former Tesla President and Founder of DVx Ventures. \u201cBy leveraging agentic AI, they are building this incredible, agile system that can be set up in under an hour and is truly a game-changer for consumer brands.\u201d Proven Results for Clients Since launching its product in early 2024, Atomic has delivered measurable results for early customers in consumer packaged goods, food & beverage, and apparel, with: 20-50% reduction in inventory costs while improving in-stock rates 40+ hours saved per week, allowing planners to focus on high-impact work 3.5x increase in inventory turnover, translating to millions in freed-up cash Atomic\u2019s simulation engine models supply and demand at the transaction level, giving planners complete transparency and the ability to adapt workflows on the fly. One Atomic customer cut its inventory levels in half while maintaining a 99% in-stock rate \u2013 just 3 months after onboarding. \u201cWe reduced our working capital by millions. It changed our strategy to fund the business this year\u201d said that company\u2019s President. \u201cAtomic is the one SaaS tool that is open all day, every day on my laptop,\u201d said the SVP of Operations at another Atomic client, where Atomic helped to improve in-stock rates by over 10 percentage points. \u201cI can\u2019t do my job well without it.\u201d AI-Powered Supply Chain Control Unlike most planning software that requires costly integrations and lengthy implementations, Atomic is using agentic AI to flip the script. Its configurable framework form fits to client data sources without requiring system integrators or manual configurations. Within an hour, Atomic clients can be initially onboarded and begin fine-tuning forecasts, simulate disruptions, and make adjustments through an intuitive, no-code interface. \u201cWe\u2019ve personally grappled with the pain of supply planning as operators,\u201d said Michael Rossiter, Founder of Atomic and Principal at DVx Ventures. \u201cPlanners shouldn\u2019t have to waste time wrangling spreadsheets and Atomic frees them up to make strategic decisions from day one. When you\u2019re drowning, you don\u2019t want swim lessons - you need help immediately. So we made onboarding speed our top priority.\u201d Strategic Backing from Industry Leaders Madrona, an early backer of Amazon, Snowflake, and Smartsheet, invested in Atomic through Fund X, a new initiative focused on applied AI for enterprise transformation. \"Atomic has keen insight into a huge business challenge\u2014and is solving it with AI to deliver tangible, immediate results that would be otherwise impossible,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, Managing Director at Madrona. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of applied AI innovation poised to transform the industry.\" What\u2019s Next For Atomic With this funding, Atomic plans to expand its engineering team, enhance AI capabilities, and deepen its integrations with leading ERP and e-commerce platforms.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. called on the head of President Donald Trump's Social Security Administration to resign on Tuesday. Schumer declared a \"Social Security Day of Action\" during a press conference in New York on Tuesday, accusing Trump, Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) of cutting Americans' social security. Schumer called on acting SSA Administrator Leland Dudek to resign. \"Dudek is bad medicine for our seniors,\" Schumer said from the podium. \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a hatchet man in Leland Dudek, an acting Commissioner with an emphasis on the 'acting,' because his real role is to dismantle the very office he is supposed to lead, make better, and protect,\" he continued. \"We have seen his audition and his work on the stage, and it is clear: Dudek is incapable of doing this job in the way it needs to be done. He won't protect seniors. He will hurt them. Leland Dudek should resign.\" ELON MUSK DUNKS ON SEN CHUCK SCHUMER, DECLARING \u2018HYSTERICAL REACTIONS' DEMONSTRATE DOGE\u2019S IMPORTANCE Chuck Schumer called on President Donald Trump to fire the acting director of the Social Security Administration.

But is India\u2019s manufacturing sector, still hamstrung by skills shortages, red tape, and infrastructural gaps, ready to seize the moment? From battery workshops near Delhi to Apple\u2019s iPhone suppliers in Tamil Nadu, the world\u2019s eyes are on India \u2014 a country poised for potential, but still racing to catch up. AP Workers stitch clothes at a factory located in a slum in Dharavi, Mumbai, India, Thursday, April 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool) When President Donald Trump imposed a 27% tariff on most Indian exports to the United States, there was anxiety in New Delhi. But there was also calculation. India\u2019s business leaders and government officials saw something more than just a slap on the wrist. They saw an opening. China , India's biggest economic rival, was hit far harder. Vietnam, too. And when Trump doubled down, lifting the tariff on Chinese goods to a whopping 145%, India\u2019s prospects began to look even brighter. \"This is a significant opportunity for India's trade and industry,\" said Praveen Khandelwal, a member of Parliament from Bharatiya Janata Party, speaking to The New York Times . Khandelwal is also a prominent voice in India\u2019s business lobby. For years, India has sought to become a manufacturing alternative to China. Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign, launched in 2014, promised to transform the country into a global factory floor. But while the slogans sounded grand, India\u2019s supply chains tell a messier story. Foxconn, iPhones and Made-in-India dreams There have been some wins. Apple\u2019s Taiwanese supplier Foxconn has begun producing iPhones in Tamil Nadu, gradually shifting some of its China-based operations to India. According to one person involved in the Apple supply chain, production in India may soon account for 30% of global iPhones, a significant jump from near zero just a few years ago. Live Events That\u2019s not all. In the weeks leading up to Trump's 27% tariff announcement, electronics shipments from Tamil Nadu's main airport doubled, rising to over 2,000 tonnes a month. Apple and others had clearly begun to hedge their bets. But beneath the headline successes lies a more sobering truth. Despite a decade of industrial policy and more than $26 billion in government incentives, India\u2019s manufacturing sector has shrunk in proportion to the broader economy \u2014 now accounting for less than 13% of GDP, down from 15% a decade ago. In contrast, manufacturing contributes roughly 25% of GDP in many East Asian economies. India had initially promised 100 million new manufacturing jobs by 2022. That goal now looks far out of reach. Inside India\u2019s Factories: Bright lights, imported parts Just an hour\u2019s drive from New Delhi, the Rai Industrial Estate in Haryana tells a revealing story. In 2019, Vikram Bathla founded LiKraft, a battery manufacturer. His 300 workers, mostly migrants from poorer Indian states, carefully assemble lithium-ion batteries under bright fluorescent lights. But look closely: the battery cells are marked \u201cMade in Inner Mongolia\u201d. The larger welding machines? Chinese. The supply chain? Still foreign. \u201cWe can buy the equipment, and we do,\u201d Bathla told The New York Times. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have is the skilled workers to use it.\u201d In five years, Bathla says, he\u2019s still trying to catch up with competitors who had a 15-year head start. Down the road, AutoKame, which makes car-seat covers, faces similar constraints. The firm imports robotic cutters from Germany and Italy, and relies on imported synthetic fibres. The result? \u201cMade in India\u201d often means assembled in India, with parts from somewhere else. The Stubborn Barriers: Land, lawyers, and loops of red tape India\u2019s manufacturing woes go beyond technology and training. Anil Bhardwaj, head of a manufacturing trade organisation, points to deep-rooted issues: high land costs, lack of specialised engineers, unreliable bank financing, and government flip-flops that create uncertainty for investors. But Bhardwaj also highlights a more unusual bottleneck: the court system. \"That's why people really fear the big companies in India,\" he said. With more than 50 million cases pending, India's sluggish judiciary leaves small businesses vulnerable. Challenging powerful corporations \u2014 or their political allies \u2014 can spell ruin. So many small firms deliberately avoid expanding, wary of being dragged into legal hell. Progress is real, Bhardwaj concedes. Electricity is now far more available than a decade ago. Modi\u2019s digital reforms have eased some business procedures. But the fundamentals remain brittle. Even as it aligns more closely with the US, India remains tightly enmeshed in Chinese supply chains. About 40% of Vietnam\u2019s imports come from China\u2014a figure mirrored in India\u2019s dependence on Chinese electronics and machinery. Now, New Delhi sees a fresh opening: stepping into the gap left by Chinese e-commerce exporters as Washington imposes tariffs of over 120% on low-value shipments from China starting in May. A report by the Delhi-based think tank GTRI calls it a \u201cmassive opportunity\u201d for Indian small businesses, handicraft exporters, and fashion sellers\u2014 if the government can cut through the red tape. America\u2019s Gamble: Can India replace China? As tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate, some US policymakers see India as the strategic swing partner in a new anti-China coalition. According to Bloomberg, Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has floated a \u201cgrand encirclement\u201d plan, aimed at building economic alliances with India, Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea to isolate China. \u201cThey\u2019ve been good military allies, not perfect economic allies. At the end of the day, we can probably reach an agreement with them,\u201d Bessent said. India fits this vision neatly. It has a massive market, a fraught relationship with China, and a desire to be seen as a global leader. Its decision to shut out Chinese tech firms like BYD, while welcoming US giants such as Tesla , signals a deliberate pivot. Trump\u2019s 90-day tariff reprieve to countries like India is part of the playbook. The idea: reward countries that align with US trade goals, block Chinese transshipments, and buy American goods. In return, they avoid punishing US tariffs. But is New Delhi really ready? Boeing, Beijing, and the Backlash The deeper fallout from Trump\u2019s trade war is being felt elsewhere. In a retaliatory move, Beijing instructed Chinese airlines to halt new orders from Boeing, its largest aircraft supplier. The move stunned observers, especially as China was projected to buy nearly 9,000 Boeing jets over the next two decades. India, by comparison, is expected to order just 2,400. The message from China was clear: it is willing to bear the pain of disruption, even in aviation, to bolster its domestic manufacturer, COMAC. Meanwhile, critics in the US say Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff regime \u2014 with carve-outs for some sectors and abrupt reversals for others \u2014 reeks of cronyism. One meme, widely shared on Chinese social media, shows Trump declaring \u201cI hold the cards\u201d, with Xi responding: \u201cThe cards are made in China.\u201d Red lines and red faces Back in the US, liberal commentators are openly questioning whether Trump is outmanoeuvring Beijing \u2014 or simply flailing. \u201cWhat if you get into a trade war with China and you lose?\u201d asked Ezra Klein, a liberal podcaster. \u201cWhat if... you make China look stronger, more reliable, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries?\u201d Trump\u2019s apparent indecision \u2014 first withholding pharmaceutical tariffs, then suggesting he may reinstate them \u2014 has frustrated even his own base. His move to exempt automakers from certain tariffs has led to allegations of insider dealing. The $42 billion US toy industry, heavily reliant on China, is also lobbying hard for exemptions. As Trump himself put it, \u201cI don\u2019t change my mind. I\u2019m just a very flexible person.\u201d The Moment is here. But can India seize it? India\u2019s moment, it seems, has arrived. Trump\u2019s punishing tariffs on China have reshuffled global supply chains. Western companies are looking to diversify. Diplomatically, New Delhi is being courted. Strategically, it is vital. But the question remains: can India deliver? Its vast potential is undeniable. But the same hurdles \u2014 lack of skilled workers, fragile infrastructure, legal quagmires, and policy unpredictability \u2014 still loom large. If India wants to become the factory of the world, it will need more than favourable tariffs and bold headlines. It needs to fix the factory floor. And fast.

Imagine that solar roof that now needs attention with the installer AWOL. The solar industry is about to become the least popular in the U.S. with hundreds of thousands of disappointed customers. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Cesar Barbosa is busy in a hot new field\u2013solar decommissioning. And repowering too if the tax credit is still there. \u201cAs the founder of NuLife Power Services,\u201d he states, \u201cI\u2019m proud to lead a nationally recognized company specializing in Repowering, Removal & Reinstallation, and Decommissioning for aging solar assets across North America.\u201d For me, it\u2019s not just about revitalizing solar systems\u2014it\u2019s about building a strong workforce through solid leadership and investing in people who are driven to make a lasting impact in renewable energy. The name NuLife reflects our mission: giving aging solar systems\u2014and the teams behind them\u2014a chance to shine. He adds: My solar company helps clients manage complex end-of-life challenges, specializing in residential portfolio repairs and commercial repowering. My consulting business empowers business owners and managers to unlock their inner champion through a Christian lens. Busted Sunnova has thousands of customers under 25-year contracts in California, where Barbosa works. What happens to them? And as other solar companies bite the dust \u2026 Removing solar panels is and will be a big business indeed. Warning! Solar Waste Ahead! In a recent social media post, Barbosa warned : A bold prediction no one wants to hear: Half of all commercial solar systems installed before 2016 will be underperforming or non-operational by 2030. The solar industry is obsessed with the future. Cutting-edge panels (bigger is better). Sleek batteries. Dazzling projections for new installs. But here\u2019s the reality we can\u2019t afford to ignore: a silent crisis unfolding on rooftops across America\u2014a crisis I\u2019ve been tackling firsthand since 2012, traveling the country with SunPower to address some of the industry\u2019s most pressing system failures. Across the country, tens of thousands of rooftop solar systems\u2014once hailed as the clean energy revolution\u2014are quietly decaying. Not because the technology failed, but because the industry did. We rushed to install. We cut corners. We promised 25 years of performance\u2026 and delivered systems that can\u2019t make it past 10. He continues: Here\u2019s what\u2019s killing them: Inverters are dying\u2014many are already out of warranty, with no replacements available. Wiring and electrical infrastructure that was never designed for 25+ years of exposure. Install quality? Forget it\u2014an army of barely trained crews built the boom, and now we\u2019re paying the price. Maintenance? There was no plan. Just a contract, a handshake, and a hope it would all work out. This is not just an engineering issue\u2014it\u2019s a financial one. Underperforming assets are generating less revenue than forecasted, while increasing the risk of electrical faults, fire hazards, and insurance claims. And here\u2019s the kicker: almost no one is ready to deal with this wave of system failures. Asset managers, facility owners, and even EPCs are discovering that repowering, remediation, or decommissioning is far more complex and expensive than expected. This is where the next frontier of solar energy lies\u2014not in installing the next 100GW\u2014it\u2019s rescuing the first 100GW. Revitalization. Repowering. Responsible end-of-life planning. The question isn\u2019t whether it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s whether we have the guts to face it. Are we going to keep pitching the dream\u2014or finally clean up the mess we left behind? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 4.8 33 votes Article Rating Share this: Click to print (Opens in new window) Print Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email Post More Click to share on GETTR (Opens in new window) GETTR Tweet Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram Like this: Like Loading...

Solar really means Solar Plus Battery. Solar is really good for two things\u2026 Running desktop calculators AND recharging Batteries. For utility use though those Batteries are HYUGE, damned expensive and potentially volatile from thermal runaway. Rooftop solar is pretty good for recharging a powerwall battery to run your house but, in the summer I use 45KWh per day so would need a system that included not only 45KWh of storage but a solar recharging system capable of providing that same 45KWh during the 4 hour solar prime time \u2026 10am \u2013 2pm AND a guarantee that the sun would always shine sufficiently every day\u2026yeah riiiight. 38 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to Bryan A April 15, 2025 10:28 am I have always contended that the model was wrong. Diesel electric is the right approach. The battery powers the electric generator and the battery is recharged, constantly. This business of using inverters is inefficient. The switchover required to have battery stand in for solar is inefficient. The simplest solution generally is the best, but that is not how it has been pursued. Do not misunderstand. I do not view grid scale solar or wind as viable. Wind mills and solar voltaic have some nice niche applications, but beyond a golf cart here and maybe an off the grid house there, nothing of any kind of scale. We are obsessed with creating monuments. That is what the misnamed \u201cfarms\u201d are.

I looked into solar on two separate occasions over a 15 year span in CO where there supposedly 300+ days of sunshine. No difference in cost to install, operate and no increase in life expectancy, Hence, no economic value or ROI to justify the upfront costs. In AZ now, might try again, but not likely.

As for \u201crunning desktop calculators\u201d, yes, sure, my 2 x 5kW inverters can only put out 10kW of power, how will I cope? The batteries are not \u201cvolatile from thermal runaway\u201d, because they use LiFePo4, which doesn\u2019t suffer from thermal runaway like EV batteries do. What is this rubbish about \u201cthe 4 hour solar prime time \u2013 10am \u2013 2pm\u201d? My batteries start charging about an hour after sunrise, when the solar panel output exceeds the background use in my house, and in the Summer, by 11am my 15kWh batteries are fully charged, then I can run anything I want \u2013 hot water, air conditioner on 24/7, etc. If I was able to export (my inverters are incapable of this), I could export 50kWh or more for four months of the year. But I totally agree that in the Winter, solar is next to useless, in the U.K. The output can be dire \u2013 one day I only generated 1.5kWh \u2013 from 12kW of solar panels! -8 Bryan A Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 2:21 pm While your batteries can charge in the run up of solar (8am \u2013 10am) as well as dropoff (2pm \u2013 4pm) you get nothing useful between 5pm and 7am and your peak usefulness (anywhere near nameplate capacity) IS 10am \u2013 2 pm local time. 14 DMacKenzie Reply to Bryan A April 16, 2025 6:13 am Having enough solar to run air conditioning on a sunny afternoon has some justification\u2026.expensive though\u2026. 0 wilpost Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 2:44 pm That is why so many UK folks go to Spain for the winter.

Brilliant! Myself, I need energy both at night and in the winter. 0 Iain Reid Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 11:25 pm Steve, you are looking inward,to your own situation.What solar does is distort grid input requirements, this can be relatively benign, if there is not too much of it but when it swamps the grid as it does in some very sunny areas requires a second back up generation source, running all the time, sometimes at wastefull low output but necessary to pick up the plummeting solar output as the sun goes down but the load remains or increases. This is a crazy way to run a grid. Dump the solar. A final point, the economics of personal solar is only posible due to the renewables on the grid increasing unit cost to the householder quite significantly, .i.e. if we did not connect renewables to a grid solar would become uneconomic. 2 Peter K Reply to Iain Reid April 16, 2025 6:21 am Distortion of grid is case of On Grid solar systems without batteries. Then you have intermittency of seconds, 20s of full sunshine, pushing energy to grid, following 20s of zero production, sucking from grid. Steve has system with 15kWh battery what is I guess more than day of energy reserve for him. This is making intermittency of 1 day, what is easily manageable and predicable in the grid. Even nuclear power plants can respond with such intermittency. 0 Iain Reid Reply to Peter K April 16, 2025 6:37 am Peter, I\u2019m sorry you do not seem to comprehend what I said:- \u201cplummeting solar output as the sun goes down but the load remains or increases.\u201d We are talking gigawatt figures here and conventional generators are essentially going from low output and flooring the throttle to try and keep up as solar output disappears. 0 Peter K Reply to Iain Reid April 16, 2025 7:47 am We are evidently on different waves here. I\u2019m saying that home solar system with batteries is not putting any strain on grid generators in night. Does not matter how many of them you put on the houses, it will not increase nightly energy needs. What you are describing are On Grid systems without battery, where during lunchtime it is covering 100% of energy needs, but evening and night production is 0 and generators are starting. This will not happen with systems which have at least 1 day battery energy reserves. 0 heme212 Reply to Bryan A April 15, 2025 3:34 pm what are you talking about?

My electricity use, especially for cooling, is almost perfectly aligned with solar energy. When it\u2019s hot, I need to cool. My ROI for solar power would be between 10 and 15 years. Probably similar if I bought a battery and associated inverter etc too. By then it would probably need significant maintenance and/or replacement. No thanks. I\u2019ll save my money and invest it in something with a better return. 3 Izaak Walton Reply to Bryan A April 15, 2025 9:56 pm \u201c The problem with solar is the simple fact that solar can\u2019t produce usable energy \u201cWhen It\u2019s Needed\u201d during peak use time so it must be stored.\u201d And yet plants have managed to survive on solar power for over a billion years. In addition to which they provided enough surplus energy for dinosaurs, elephants, blue whales etc to thrive and grow. Plus of course before we started using nuclear energy all of our energy requirements were met using stored energy from plants. So it seems odd that solar panels which are 20% efficient can produce using energy when plants do so while being only 3% efficient. -6 johnesm Reply to Izaak Walton April 15, 2025 10:42 pm Plants are power plants, in a sense, but can your backyard trees power your television, refrigerator, computer, and lights? 5 Izaak Walton Reply to johnesm April 16, 2025 1:01 am what do you think coal is? It is just the remains of plants (mostly trees) and coal can easily power your appliances. If plants can do this with an efficiency of less than 4% then solar panels can do it with an efficiency of over 20%. -3 Oldseadog Reply to Izaak Walton April 16, 2025 3:04 am Yes, coal can do these things but in GB we aren\u2019t allowed to dig it up and use it. 2 Peter K Reply to johnesm April 16, 2025 6:26 am Absolutely not problem. Steam engine plus generator and little piece of wood, grass, shrub can give you electric energy. 0 Tony_G Reply to Izaak Walton April 16, 2025 7:26 am plants have managed to survive on solar power for over a billion years Plants are evolved (over that billion years) to utilize \u201csolar power\u201d when it is available \u2013 i.e. during daytime hours. Modern electrical systems are not. It\u2019s not even close to a valid comparison \u2013 you\u2019re comparing apples to transformers. 0 Izaak Walton Reply to Tony_G April 16, 2025 8:56 am Plants also store solar energy to use when the sun doesn\u2019t shine. And do that so well that they have generated a surplus that powers the entire animal kingdom. So if they can do so it while the efficiency of photosynthesis is less than 2% then surely we can figure out how to do the same with using solar panels with an efficiency of over 20%. 0 Tony_G Reply to Izaak Walton April 16, 2025 9:42 am Again, you are comparing billions of years of natrual evolution to decades of technology. It is not even vaguely a valid comparison. Do plants use batteries to store their energy? Do our solar installations use cells to store their energy? They are not even close to being the same thing. The mechanisms of energy storage are completely different.

The panels themselves, if out of sight on a flat roof, may well have suffered weather damage without you knowing. The list goes on\u2026 It\u2019s like any piece of equipment \u2013 it needs checking over on a regular basis if it is to keep functioning efficiently. 2 Joseph Zorzin Reply to atticman April 16, 2025 4:02 am Most people want to avoid complexity in their lives. Like Thoreau said, \u201csimplify, simplify\u201d. We want to have our homes plugged into the grid- and let the power company engineers have all these worries to provide us with dependable, low cost energy. Who has time to do everything we need to do- plus regularly checking on our solar panels. If someone gets pleasure out of that and they have the time and skill, fine, but the rest of us don\u2019t want it. All these issue to keep track of remind me of maintenance of my pickup and car- change oil, rotate tires, get inspection, etc. 1 Peter K Reply to Joseph Zorzin April 16, 2025 6:32 am I\u2019m sweeping dust sometimes. Like once per year. But only on my flat roof panels, my main panels are not touched for 3 years, still overperforming nameplate by 10% when it is cold sunny and windy. 0 Gregg Eshelman Reply to Joseph Zorzin April 15, 2025 7:28 pm Keep the panels clean. Have the install done so wiring, connectors, and components are always shaded from UV light exposure and protected from rain and snow. Most installs at best rely on the shade from the panels for that, and \u2018micro\u2019 inverters are typically attached directly to the backs of the panels, where they can bake in the heat that conducts through. Panels also need to be inspected periodically for damage. Ones with glass fronts can crack or delaminate. The PV cells are sandwiched between glass and the backing in a clear gooey substance. That protects them from oxidation. In early PV panels that clear goo wasn\u2019t UV resistant and it would turn yellow over time, reducing the conversion efficiency. PV panels all have an output degradation curve. In the first 5 years they typically lose 10% to 15% of their output. After that there\u2019s a sharp reduction in how much they degrade. Over the rest of the lifetime of the panels it\u2019s very little. So when you install a PV system you want to over-capacity it by at least 15% and consider that \u201cextra\u201d as non-existent, then never expand your load over the total rated capacity minus 15%. Then in 5 years you won\u2019t find your house short on solar power. Or you can save some money and space by buying used panels that have baked in the sun for five years. Then you\u2019ll only need to over-capacity the install by around 5% because that\u2019s about what they\u2019ll degrade over the next 20 years. However, 5 year old panels right now will most likely be 2\u00d73 foot 100 Watt panels. New panels that size are more efficient and can kick out considerably more than 100 Watts, though as already noted, you should always knock off 15% on the capacity. 0 Joseph Zorzin Reply to Gregg Eshelman April 16, 2025 3:52 am With all the other things we have to worry about in our homes- plumbing, wiring, things breaking and needing fixing, ad infinitum- seems to me most people wouldn\u2019t want to add all that worry having their own solar panels. They\u2019d rather let the \u201cpower company\u201d have those worries with a reliable dependable power generation. 1 Peter K Reply to Joseph Zorzin April 16, 2025 6:37 am Problem here is that \u201cpower company\u201d is not yours, they can switch you off as they want. They can have technical outages too. There is no difference if you pay power company or technician which will check your system regularly. But it is YOUR system, nobody can switch it off for you. 0 Joseph Zorzin Reply to Peter K April 16, 2025 6:48 am Yuh, but without subsidies, my own power company would be far more expensive. As for paying a tech- when I need a plumber, they\u2019re now about $150/hour around here. Electricians a bit cheaper. What will a solar tech guy charge? I just want cheap energy and to not think about it- too many other things to think about. 0 Peter K Reply to Joseph Zorzin April 16, 2025 7:53 am It is same as with gas furnace, air conditioning, etc, you still need some 150$/hour guy for maintenance. But it is working somehow, those appliances are designed to work 10 years without touching. (If you are lucky) 0 Joseph Zorzin Reply to Peter K April 16, 2025 8:54 am Right- forgot about my annual maintenance on my oil furnace. It takes the guy about half an hour and I think the charge is just under $200. When I owned a natural gas furnace on my first house it didn\u2019t need annual servicing. It was installed by my plumber uncle 30 years before I bought the house and worked perfectly. 0 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to Joseph Zorzin April 16, 2025 6:20 am You stand on the solar voltaic cells and shine a flashlight on them? 0 drh Reply to Joseph Zorzin April 16, 2025 7:04 am I\u2019ve had solar for over a decade now.

They are nominally rated at 195 watts each on an array rated 1755 watts. Early morning when the batteries are being charged the three arrays are all running at 1400- watts in full sunshine. Batteries typically are charged in 2 \u2013 4 hours depending on what we are running in the cabin and separate home office our daughter works out of. I know people in our off-grid area that have been out here for 30+ years and their panels are still producing 50 \u2013 60% of rated capacity.

The most efficient, least cost way of implementing it is to install the right capacity for each individual user, as close as possible to where the power will be used. It\u2019s very inefficient to concentrate a huge amount of solar power conversion into a large area, combine it all into a few large wires, then send it out through the webwork of the existing \u201cgrid\u201d to a large number of users who are using widely varying and constantly changing amounts of electricity. That\u2019s been workable with concentrated \u201cpoint sources\u201d of electricity like oil/gas/coal, nuclear, and hydro power plants that kick out many megawatts 24/7, essentially at the turn of a switch. The power goes right into the big main wires with minimal loss. With large solar \u2018farms\u2019 the losses start immediately, right at the inverter on each panel. Every connection, every foot of wire takes away a tiny bit due to resistance. It\u2019s taking a diffuse power source and \u201csqueezing\u201d it down for transport then spreading it out again. 3 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to Gregg Eshelman April 16, 2025 6:25 am The area of land coverage also introduces additional I^2*R losses due to wire resistance. Details matter. 0 Mike Jonas Editor Reply to D Sandberg April 15, 2025 5:10 pm Solar power never needed to be made illegal. Just letting it compete in an open fair market would sort out the winners. Solar would win where it is better. My solar is brilliant for summer daytime airconditioning. With (very expensive) battery it\u2019s protection against rocketing power prices. So I think there would be a market for solar, and only those who wanted it would pay for it. 4 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to Mike Jonas April 16, 2025 6:27 am You are describing a valid niche application.

Also, the new panels contain much less of those expensive metal materials (that\u2019s how they drove the cost down). So they\u2019re much harder to recycle. 10 George T Reply to buckeyebob April 15, 2025 11:38 am I have not read anything on these solar panels having any economic through recycling. Grant there are using metals that could be recovered, but at what cost and would it be profitable? 5 not you Reply to buckeyebob April 15, 2025 12:30 pm no, it is not 5 MarkW Reply to buckeyebob April 15, 2025 1:44 pm There are valuable metals in solar panels. I challenge your contention that there are a lot of these metals in them. The contacts for each cell has maybe a few milligrams of precious metals. Then there are the wires that connect the cells and panels together. Maybe a pound for your average home sized array. There\u2019s maybe 20 to 30 pounds of iron in the brackets holding everything. The materials that make up the cells themselves are not recoverable. They would have to be crushed, melted and chemically separated. Not enough material to justify the cost. 5 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to MarkW April 16, 2025 6:32 am The bond wires shifted from gold to aluminum decades ago as were the lands. The lands are sometimes gold, but mostly now aluminum. The cost of extracting a few micrograms of aluminum will far exceed the value of the metal. 0 bnice2000 Reply to buckeyebob April 15, 2025 2:16 pm I heard the cost of recycling a solar panel is 2 to 3 times the cost of a new panel. 3 Leon de Boer Reply to bnice2000 April 15, 2025 5:09 pm It is I have a collection of them and there are only a couple of recyclers who will take them in Australia. 3 buckeyebob Reply to buckeyebob April 16, 2025 5:52 am Evidently no one caught the sarcasm. 0 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to buckeyebob April 16, 2025 6:33 am Well, given the contentiousness of posts, it would be well advised in the future to employ a \u201c/s\u201d notation. 0 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to buckeyebob April 16, 2025 6:29 am Solar voltaic cells are semiconductors. It is not trivial to recover even a measurable percentage of the non-silicon elements diffused in the wafer processing. You make the claim. Now list the companies that are making an un-subsidized profit doing just that. 0 David Dibbell April 15, 2025 10:36 am We all knew this day would come, didn\u2019t we? 17 Paul Seward Reply to David Dibbell April 15, 2025 10:56 am Yep, All predictable and foreseeable if eyes and minds were open at the time. 6 stevejones Reply to David Dibbell April 15, 2025 1:08 pm No \u201cday has come\u201d, the article is bullshit. Modern solar panels are incredibly cheap, have guaranteed outputs for 25 years, i.e. you will lose maybe 10% over 25 years, which is amazing for an item that just sits there and produces electricity day in, day out, while exposed to all weathers, especially baking in the sun. Inverters are dirt cheap nowadays too, but most of you here haven\u2019t got solar systems, or if you have, you didn\u2019t build them yourselves, and don\u2019t understand how they work, so you think they are a \u2018magic box\u2019. -25 MarkW Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 1:46 pm The panels that are dying, also had guaranteed lifespans. None of them made it. 9 Leon de Boer Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 5:05 pm ROFL a solar panel that makes 25 years yet to see one. I have had solar installs for 15 years not a single original panel exists. You are going to need to replace them at 10 the only good part is the new panel will put out more power than the old for the same footprint. 6 doonman Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 9:09 pm HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA \u201cguaranteed\u201d.

What does this do to solar panels? 0 Randle Dewees Reply to littlepeaks April 15, 2025 11:54 am The same thing it does to car windshields and roofs 6 Mr. April 15, 2025 11:23 am Utility scale power generation and distribution will always need a well-considered mix of generation fuels and devices, principally made up of those that can be relied upon for spinning reserve, and >80% uptime delivery of their rated output capacities. So coal, gas, diesel, bio, hydro, nuclear are the go-to, tried & tested solutions. Wind & solar + batteries can at times be handy for supplemental power contributions when weather and diurnal cycle conditions are favourable. But just as old time wind-jammers used to have to catch the tides to navigate their way in & out of ports, modern ships have reliable, on-demand engines to ensure they can enter & leave ports safely, on-time as required. Your wind & solar electricity generation technologies are the equivalent of wind-jammers relying on tide movements to use ports. We\u2019re way past those times now. 7 honestyrus Reply to Mr. April 15, 2025 1:00 pm Love the sail boat analogy. 4 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to Mr. April 16, 2025 6:37 am Maryland has solar farms.

When I moved to Arizona I look at solar and penciled it out. Since I did not accept the 20 year life time and put it down at 15 years the ROI did not work out, even with subsidies. When they sell these system the lies come fast, lifetime, maintenance and disposal are never in their play book. Grid storage is the number one lie, which I always call them on. 4 Sparta Nova 4 Reply to mal April 16, 2025 6:41 am I did a research project in the 70s and predicted that in the ensuring decades solar voltaics would achieve the efficiencies we see today. It also included a reliability assessment and addressed Moore\u2019s Law. It concluded that we would see improvements but we would still be bound to limited applications. 0 stevejones April 15, 2025 12:59 pm \u201cA bold prediction no one wants to hear: Half of all commercial solar systems installed before 2016 will be underperforming or non-operational by 2030.\u201d A PREDICTION, not fact, just his OPINIONS. What does \u201cunderperforming\u201d mean? Does it mean \u201cgiving out less electricity than when the solar panel was installed twenty years ago\u201d? If so, then of course, ALL solar panels degrade by a fraction of a percent every year. Look at the environment they are in \u2013 baking in hot sun for hours every day in the Summer, freezing cold in the Winter, rained on for days at a time. Modern solar panels are amazing technology, and dirt cheap. I like how he writes \u201cunderperforming OR non-operational\u201d. There is (obviously) a HUGE difference between the two. What is the \u201csilent crisis\u201d of which he speaks? Solar panels are now about half the price I paid just three years ago for mine. What\u2019s this bullshit: \u201cWe promised 25 years of performance\u2026 and delivered systems that can\u2019t make it past 10.\u201d Who is \u201cwe\u201d? Which solar panels (which are all that matters, since inverters will inevitably stop working, and are now only \u00a3300 for a 5kW hybrid inverter in the U.K. \u2013 just search on Ebay.co.uk for \u201cSolar inverter 48V\u201d) aren\u2019t making it past ten years of use? What a load of rubbish. \u201cInverters are dying\u2014many are already out of warranty, with no replacements available.\u201d WTF? You can plug any solar panels into any inverter, you just need to make sure you have the correct number in a string, so the voltage is high enough to work, and not too many, so you don\u2019t exceed the maximum voltage the inverter can handle. \u201cno replacements available\u201d is a ridiculous and obvious LIE. \u201cWiring and electrical infrastructure that was never designed for 25+ years of exposure.\u201d What? Where? What solar cable can\u2019t cope with 25 years of \u201cexposure\u201d? Oh, the humanity. Hundreds of millions of homes have electric cables coming across telegraph poles, and they seem to stand up to the \u2018exposure\u2019. \u201cInstall quality? Forget it\u2014an army of barely trained crews built the boom, and now we\u2019re paying the price.\u201d Yes, of course, because he says so, and he knows that EVERY solar installer was \u201cbarely trained\u201d. This is just laughable. This is one of the worst articles on Watts Up With That. You really need to start learning how solar installations work, look at the cost of new solar panels, inverters, and so on, and stop reprinting laughable rubbish which ISN\u2019T HELPING YOUR CASE. -21 MarkW Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 1:49 pm You really are desperate to preach the gospel. 10 paul courtney Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 3:51 pm Mr. jones: You are the one with a case. 7 Leon de Boer Reply to stevejones April 15, 2025 7:27 pm Don\u2019t know where you live but in Australia you can\u2019t simply plug in an inverter as you declare you need an SAA license and an unrestricted electrical license to install one and I suspect it is because of accidents with gyro gear looses like you. You can also only replace a panel with like for like unless you specifically know a lot about the panel grid layout because any in series need to have the same amperage output not something the average layman knows. Then you find the panel you bought 10 years ago is no longer made and so you have to replace a couple of panels. I stated above I have had solar installations for 15 years not one has an original panel largely because usually if one gets a fault they are all in a state of decay or you can\u2019t get the grid layout to work.

Like EVs, solar power sources were never tested long enough to see whether they would remain viable over the long term or how long they would last when exposed to everyday weather fluctuations. Yet as long as governments were willing to use tax revenue to subsidize an unproven product, there were enough takers to get the solar bandwagon rolling.

DOGE International Cyber Threats A user with a Russian IP address tried to log into National Labor Relations Board systems just minutes after the Department of Government Efficiency moved to access and extract troves of sensitive data from inside the agency, according to an extensive whistleblower disclosure released Tuesday. The whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, provided forensic evidence and internal documentation to Congress and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, accusing DOGE of exfiltrating large volumes of confidential data and disabling various security monitoring systems used to scan for malicious behavior in NLRB\u2019s networks, NPR first reported . The user attempting to log in relied on a newly created DOGE email account and the attempts were \u201cnear real-time,\u201d according to the Berulis disclosure. It\u2019s not clear whether the user was actually in Russia because hackers often use techniques to remotely mask their true location. The login attempts were blocked, but the person used a correct username and password, suggesting that adversaries may already be testing entry points potentially exposed by DOGE\u2019s activities across the government. The whistleblower\u2019s disclosure was accompanied by a cover letter from his attorney, Andrew Bakaj of Whistleblower Aid, which said that, after he raised concerns internally about DOGE\u2019s inroads into the agency, he received a physically taped threat on his door containing personal information and overhead photos of him walking his dog. A DOGE spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. DOGE, overseen by Elon Musk, is not an official government agency and was stood up as a reworking of the U.S. Digital Service at the start of the Trump administration to eliminate perceived federal spending waste. The accusations from Berulis are not an isolated incident, NPR reported, citing an aide for the Democratic minority on the House Oversight Committee who said the panel is \u201cin possession of multiple verifiable reports showing that DOGE has exfiltrated sensitive government data across agencies\u201d for reasons that are unknown. \u201cThis case has been particularly sensitive as it involves the possibility of sophisticated foreign intelligence gaining access to sensitive government systems, which is why we went to the Senate Intelligence Committee directly,\u201d said Bakaj. Spokespeople for Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. and Mark Warner, D-Va., the top lawmakers on the Senate panel, did not immediately return requests for comment. The disclosures underscore the breadth of DOGE\u2019s expansion across the federal landscape , and follow mounting legal challenges over its sweeping access to Americans\u2019 financial and personal data. How that data is being protected, processed or used remains unclear. Broader security and privacy concerns about DOGE have been compounded by the cost-cutting entity\u2019s access to highly sensitive labor information and the potential conflict of interest posed by Elon Musk\u2019s dual role in government and as chief of companies under active NLRB investigation, including SpaceX and Tesla. NLRB\u2019s case systems contain data like union organizing activities, employee whistleblower identities, legal strategies and proprietary business information. The whistleblower claims DOGE engineers used secretive and suspicious methods to pull sensitive information from the NLRB\u2019s systems. They shut off security tools that track activity, deleted evidence of what they accessed and used software that made their work nearly invisible, Berulis alleged in filings. A big spike in data leaving the agency followed, possibly through a technique that hides stolen data in normal-looking internet traffic, according to the disclosures. One engineer also appeared to be working on a tool designed to pull files from the agency\u2019s internal case system. Security experts told NPR those tactics resemble the playbook of foreign hackers and not federal workers.

An NLRB had a threatening message posted outside his office within days of filing a whistleblower complaint. rafapress/Shutterstock None of this should be surprising, but to belabor the point: DOGE has everything. It is well past time to stop nickel-and-diming the story. There is a new lengthy investigation out from NPR today detailing how Elon Musk\u2019s waste and government efficiency initiative has barreled into the National Labor Relations Department and exfiltrated mass amounts of sensitive data, taking great lengths to cover its tracks, and threatening employees who speak out. Experts in cybersecurity likened the actions taken to those of a state-sponsored hacking group, questioning why a mandate to save money in government would require such cloak-and-dagger behavior\u2014DOGE staffers demanded activity logging be disabled, and wiped their anonymous user accounts on the way out. The most salacious detail in the story regards Daniel Berulis, an IT employee who pieced together breadcrumbs left behind by DOGE. His concerns triggered a formal investigation of what appeared to be a serious, ongoing breach or potentially illegal removal of sensitive data: In the days after Berulis and his colleagues prepared a request for CISA\u2019s help investigating the breach, Berulis found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure. It\u2019s unclear who sent it, but the letter made specific reference to his decision to report the breach. Law enforcement is investigating the letter. After DOGE left the building, Berulis began looking around to piece together what they had done and found very little. Upwards of 10 gigabytes of data was taken out, data which could include information on unions and ongoing legal cases, a particular concern since Musk\u2019s empire of companies has repeatedly been the subject of labor lawsuits that he has deemed unconstitutional. But \u201clogs that were used to monitor outbound traffic from the system were absent\u201d and \u201csome actions taken on the network, including data exfiltration, had no attribution \u2014 except to a \u2018deleted account\u2019.\u201d It was discovered through NPR\u2019s investigation that a DOGE engineer, Jordan Wick, had a repository on his GitHub called \u201c NxGenBdoorExtract,\u201d whose name suggests it could be a backdoor system to extract files from NxGen, the NLRB\u2019s internal case management system. One of DOGE\u2019s other workers, who goes by the name \u201cBig Balls,\u201d has previously worked for a cyberhacking group , providing cloud hosting services to a gang that trafficked in stolen data. What is more, unknown users had granted themselves high-level keys to access NLRB storage, and there was no way to access what they did with the permission. PowerShell downloads were visible on the systems, which allow engineers to run automated commands, and several code libraries \u201cappeared to be designed to automate and mask data exfiltration.\u201d There was even a tool to generate endless numbers of IP addresses, another way to mask where data was going. Controls were disabled that would prevent unauthorized devices, like smartphones, from logging onto the system without permission, and two-factor authentication was also turned off. Musk has said that would recuse himself of any work involving his companies. \u201cI\u2019m getting a sort of a daily proctology exam here,\u201d he said in an interview with Fox News. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be getting away [with] something in the dead of night.\u201d But Musk has also used data obtained from agencies including the Social Security Administration to spread unfounded claims of fraud, and relentlessly attacked the former Biden administration in retaliation over Tesla not being invited to a White House EV summit. It has been speculated that Musk may have an interest in learning about investigations into Tesla or X\u2014or using data to train models for xAI. But again, that is a more innocuous possibility. The more concerning potential is for Musk, who has for years been hell- bent on dismantling unions , could exploit newfound access to information on testimony, union leaders, and legal strategies. Maybe he will not use it, but the point is that there is no good reason for DOGE to be covertly exfiltrating data from the department with little to no accountability. This new reporting should not be surprising, earlier this month, the IRS reportedly held a hackathon to build a \u201cmega API\u201d that would give DOGE easier access to taxpayer data, potentially through a partnership with Palantir. And Musk famously rifled through Twitter\u2019s internal communications following his purchase of the company, firing anyone who spoke negatively about him. It is not unheard of that he might be tempted to snuff out Tesla or SpaceX whistleblowers and fire them under false pretenses. Despite assertions by Musk and others that unions harm innovation, the U.S. has undergone decades of growth, and recent surveys have found that Americans overwhelmingly support them . Union members on average make 10-20% more than nonunion workers. People get fired all the time for the lawful act of trying to form a union\u2014 including at Tesla \u2014and the public should understand that many NLRB protections are fairly toothless against big-pocketed. DOGE gaining access to sensitive information alone may be the point: Go to the authorities with your concerns and we will find you. In unrelated news, Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos\u2019 financ\u00e9 Lauren Sanchez went up to space on a Blue Origin rocket this week\u2014a stunt that was looked at with some disdain as the rest of the world back down on Earth crumbles.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO is now being called \u201cCrazy Uncle Elon\u201d by Trump officials due to his behavior and growing influence. With his DOGE project, Musk is rubbing top figures like Marco Rubio the wrong way. Officials are walking out of meetings, questioning his jokes, and even whispering about drug tests. This behind-the-scenes clash is escalating fast, and it\u2019s raising serious questions about Musk\u2019s role in Washington. Agencies Elon Musk sparks rising tension in Trump Administration as officials nickname him \u201cCrazy Uncle Elon\u201d over DOGE project chaos, awkward meetings, and drug test jokes \u2014 here\u2019s the full behind-the-scenes drama Elon Musk and the Trump Administration are clearly not on the same page these days. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who also owns X (formerly Twitter), is reportedly causing serious frustration inside the White House. According to a detailed Rolling Stone report, senior Trump officials have become so annoyed with Musk\u2019s behavior that some are now calling him \u201cCrazy Uncle Elon.\u201d This nickname isn\u2019t a joke among friends \u2014 it\u2019s being used by people close to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior officials. The situation speaks volumes about how Musk\u2019s growing role in government is rubbing some powerful people the wrong way. Why is Elon Musk irritating Trump officials so much? At the center of the tension is Musk\u2019s involvement with his self-created \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d or DOGE. The idea, on paper, is to help make the federal government run better. But inside the Trump Administration, DOGE is creating confusion, not clarity. One senior official told Rolling Stone , \u201cTalking to the guy is sometimes like listening to really rusty nails on a chalkboard.\u201d The same official added, \u201cHe\u2019s just the most irritating person I\u2019ve ever had to deal with, and that is saying something.\u201d Officials say Musk often derails meetings with offbeat jokes and sarcastic comments that fall flat. He expects people to laugh, and when they don\u2019t, he looks almost offended, according to people in the room. This awkward energy has become a regular issue during government discussions. Live Events Is Marco Rubio really that frustrated with Elon Musk? Yes, according to sources who spoke with Rolling Stone , Marco Rubio is finding it hard to hide his frustration. As Secretary of State, Rubio has had several interactions with Musk, especially as Musk\u2019s DOGE project crosses into foreign affairs. Officials close to Rubio say the nickname \u201cCrazy Uncle Elon\u201d came from within the State Department \u2014 a reflection of how his behavior is being talked about behind closed doors. These aren\u2019t just policy disagreements. They\u2019re personal, and they\u2019re growing. One official summed it up like this: \u201cElon just thinks he\u2019s smarter than everyone else in the room and acts like it, even when it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d What about those Elon Musk drug rumors? The conversation took a more serious turn when officials started privately questioning Musk\u2019s mental state and whether drugs might be involved. They\u2019ve even joked about requiring him to take regular drug tests \u2014 something Musk himself publicly supported for federal employees back in February. A lawyer for Musk told Rolling Stone that he\u2019s \u201cregularly and randomly drug-tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test.\u201d But a separate Wall Street Journal investigation reported that several current and former executives at Tesla and SpaceX claim they\u2019ve witnessed Musk use LSD, cocaine, Ecstasy, and mushrooms at private events. Even if these claims aren\u2019t confirmed, the fact that officials are discussing them shows how strained this relationship has become. Could Elon Musk lose his role in Washington? While there\u2019s no official word on whether Elon Musk will be removed or sidelined, the pressure is clearly building. What started as a high-profile partnership between Musk and the Trump Administration is now turning into a political liability for both sides. Officials have walked out of meetings. They\u2019re openly calling him irritating. And behind the scenes, some are even asking if Musk\u2019s influence is more of a problem than a benefit. For now, Musk still holds his DOGE title and continues to weigh in on key government matters. But if the whispers coming out of Washington get louder, we may start to see changes \u2014 fast.

That near-death experience helped spawn a whole new company called Atomic that\u2019s built around using AI to streamline supply chains. Co-founded by former Tesla employees Michael Rossiter and Neal Suidan, Atomic was created inside DVx Ventures, the firm run by former Tesla president Jon McNeill. Rossiter is also a partner at DVx, which has led a $3 million seed round for Atomic, with Seattle-based Madrona Ventures joining. \u201cMichael and Neil experienced this pain firsthand as leaders at Tesla in the supply chain, and I saw that work firsthand \u2014 because they worked for me,\u201d McNeill said in an interview with TechCrunch. Atomic plans to deploy its agentic AI with customers to make inventory planning faster and easier. It\u2019s already been working with pilot customers. In one case, the customer was able to cut inventory levels in half while maintaining a 99% in-stock rate. Being able to strike a balance like that frees up working capital that a business can use in other places, while also reducing risk, McNeill said. \u201cIf you have too much capital tied up in inventory, you could really harm the business. And if you have too little, where you don\u2019t have the right things in stock when the customer is ready to purchase, then you\u2019re costing yourself big time,\u201d he said. More broadly, Atomic\u2019s early customers have been in the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, and apparel industries. The company claims it has helped those customers reduce inventory costs by 20% to 50%. With so much uncertainty in the world right now, there\u2019s big demand for solutions like Atomic\u2019s because existing ones aren\u2019t built for this kind of volatility, Suidan said in an interview. Currently, \u201cplanners will, like, lock themselves in a room for a week trying to put together different scenarios, present those back to the leadership, and get a question they weren\u2019t anticipating,\u201d Suidan said. Then they \u201chave to go back to these documents, spend a few days, and it\u2019s becomes this process that can be all consuming for them, because they don\u2019t have the tools available to manage the uncertainty with confidence.\u201d Atomic\u2019s software pulls information from those same source documents but lets inventory planners and supply chain team members quickly simulate multiple scenarios \u2014 something that would normally take hours or days. Rossiter and Suidan pride themselves on being able to get up and running with a customer quickly, and with adaptability. \u201cYou can\u2019t be writing a custom application for every customer. You need a flexible data model that\u2019s generalized, that can apply to everyone, because then you can be up and running really, really quickly,\u201d Suidan said. \u201cAnd you need to give precision control to the planner so that they feel true ownership over the plan, and they can explain it inside and out, and can pull all the levers in the plan. And if you can combine those two things, which has been our total focus, then you solve the problem for the planner.\u201d Many Tesla employees have gone on to found their own startups, including former CTO JB Straubel (Redwood Materials) and, most recently, former SVP Drew Baglino ( Heron ). But Atomic is different. Instead of just taking skills learned at Tesla and applying them to new problems, Suidan and Rossiter are building Atomic around a philosophy they developed together at the automaker. \u201cThey built the end-to-end supply chain orchestration system from scratch\u201d at Tesla, McNeill said. Suidan said the value of what they built at Tesla was just as much about the solution as it was changing the process. \u201cThe way the business was planned when we started was a dozen different teams working in isolation, passing these spreadsheets around, trying to tie it together once a week to present executives some summary of a plan, and then spending most of the rest of the week, chasing our tail, trying to figure out why one part didn\u2019t work or the other part didn\u2019t work,\u201d Suidan said. \u201cOur jobs became to build a system that could thrive and drive this company, keep its dynamism, keep its ability to hit these business targets.\u201d Suidan said the planning system they built inside Tesla resulted in a \u201ccomplete transformation\u201d in the day-to-day operations. While Rossiter left Tesla shortly after the ramp-up of the Model 3, Suidan stuck around until 2022. In 2023 Suidan said the two put their heads together and asked: \u201cHow could this kind of transformation work for everybody, all businesses?\u201d And they set out to create Atomic inside DVx. In typical Tesla fashion, they really are aiming that high. \u201cOur ambition, our vision, is to support every company that sells physical goods,\u201d Rossiter said.

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump and \u201c First Buddy \u201d Elon Musk have made quite an impression on the American public as they continue to take a wrecking ball to Washington \u2014 and it\u2019s not the good kind. New polling from the University of Massachusetts Amherst reveals that after almost three months with Trump in office, a majority of respondents disapprove of Trump\u2019s actions. Just 27 percent said they \u201cStrongly Approve\u201d of his job performance, with another 17 percent indicating they \u201cSomewhat Approve\u201d of him so far in his second term, for total favorables of 44 percent. By comparison, 44 percent \u201cStrongly Disapprove,\u201d and seven percent \u201cSomewhat Disapprove,\u201d for an unfavorability rate of 51 percent. Trump is also underwater on every issue apart from immigration. At least 40 percent of respondents said he has handled jobs, foreign affairs, civil rights, inflation, and trade \u201cNot Well at All,\u201d with the president receiving especially poor marks on those last two economic fronts: a combined 62 percent unfavorable on inflation and 58 percent on trade, presumably as the cost of household necessities hasn\u2019t budged, while Trump\u2019s messy tariffs plans have roiled international markets and investment portfolios. Tatishe Nteta, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Poll , tells Rolling Stone that \u201cwith the stock market in free fall, prices remaining high, and consumer confidence in the economy at historically low levels, it is no surprise\u201d that Trump has struggled in these areas. \u201cTime will tell if President Trump will be able to regain the momentum and support that catapulted him to a second term in the White House, but at the three-month mark, President Trump and his supporters need to address the economic concerns of the public or face further declines in the president\u2019s approval ratings,\u201d he says. Trump also fared poorly on questions of his overall effect on the American political landscape, with majorities of respondents saying they were not hopeful about him uniting rather than dividing the country (53 percent) or demonstrating moral leadership in a crisis (51 percent). The UMass polling further revealed broad concern that Trump is weakening American democracy (49 percent), the nation\u2019s standing in the world (49 percent), and public health (47 percent). Overall, 65 percent of respondents opposed the idea of Trump attempting to run for a third term, in defiance of the Constitutional two-term limit for his office, with 93 percent of Democrats and 36 percent of Republicans taking this position. Trump has refused to rule out the notion, falsely claiming there are \u201c methods \u201d by which he could run again. Editor\u2019s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time And while Trump retains broad approval from self-identified Republicans and conservatives, older Americans, and his base, even some of his supporters are starting to have their doubts: 26 percent of Trump voters expressed concerns about their vote, and two percent said they already regretted it. Nteta points out that \u201chis one-time supporters are watching to see if he can deliver on his campaign promise to make America great and wealthy again.\u201d For Musk, de facto head of the Trump administration\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency , which has blazed a trail of reckless destruction through critical government agencies and fired thousands of workers, the UMass numbers are arguably even more dispiriting. Those polled were asked to rate how they feel about various groups, as well as Musk individually, from zero to 100, on a scale of \u201ccoldest\u201d to \u201cwarmest.\u201d Musk clocked in at an average of 37, five points lower than he did in October 2024, and far below federal employees, whom he has routinely disparaged and dismissed in mass firings. They scored a 58. He also ranked lower than transgender people (45) and Democrats and Republicans (both at 41). Other poll questions explored sentiment about oligarchy, with 56 percent saying that Musk has too much influence over the federal government and 59 percent signaling that they do not trust him to \u201cavoid using his public position to benefit his business interests.\u201d Majorities likewise did not trust Musk to identify programs to cut (53 percent), protect essential sources of funding (55 percent) or citizens\u2019 private information (57 percent), serve the public interest (56 percent), or communicate accurately with the public (57 percent). Over 70 percent opposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare, both of which Musk has proposed as DOGE targets. A stunning 45 percent said they \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d agree with the statement that the U.S. is \u201can oligarchy,\u201d defined as \u201ca government in which a small group exercises control especially for corrupt and selfish purposes.\u201d Only 28 percent disagreed.

(Musk has denied reports of his imminent departure from the administration.) \u201cIn the wake of Elon Musk\u2019s failed attempt to elect a conservative judge in Wisconsin, his opposition to Trump\u2019s tariff policies , and the controversies associated with his leadership of DOGE, Trump may believe that Musk, by far the largest donor to his campaign, has become more of a political liability than an asset.

Other popular choices included \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cidiot,\u201d and \u201cweird.\u201d Nteta observes that \u201cTrump has long proven adept at cutting his losses, and if Elon Musk can\u2019t regain a modicum of positive assessments by the public, he is likely going to become another in the long list of former employees of the Trump administration.\u201d All told, it appears that the honeymoon period for Trump and his right-hand adviser has been incredibly short \u2014 if indeed it existed at all. One can only conclude that their openly lawless, corrupt, and chaotic rule has not gone unnoticed by Americans who have meanwhile yet to see Trump\u2019s overstated promises of cheap groceries and national prosperity realized. As in his first term, the reality on the ground tends to undermine what he says on Truth Social and in press conferences. The big difference this time around is that he has a billionaire pal to share the blame.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by @timeless__snaps Einstein\u2019s Tongue, Titanic\u2019s Tears The creator doesn\u2019t shy away from the dramatic either.

Meanwhile, the Titanic is given a tragic yet oddly charming Snapchat spin, with Rose looking wistfully into the camera and \u201csnap story\u201d recreations that feel like Gen Z\u2019s take on period drama.

Advertisement Even Tesla ( TSLA ), led by Trump fanatic and DOGE head Elon Musk, is far from immune. \u201cWhile Tesla is in a much better situation relatively speaking \u2026 the auto tariffs are a complicating factor that could disrupt the supply chain and add cost inputs at a time Tesla and Musk are trying to balance its operations globally,\u201d Ives and company wrote. \u201cMusk is a vocal opponent to tariffs as it\u2019s clear the negative impact this would have on the U.S. auto market with U.S. consumers ultimately paying the higher prices/taxes/tariffs.\u201d The analysts estimated that the tariffs in their current form would add up to $100 billion in annual costs to the U.S. auto industry. These costs \u201cwill essentially get passed directly onto the consumer and clearly erode demand on Day 1 of tariffs,\u201d they said. Advertisement On Monday, Trump said he would be open to short-term exemptions for automakers that import parts from Canada and Mexico. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna make them here, but they need a little bit of time, so I\u2019m talking about things like that,\u201d he said. Still, no further details on potential exemptions have been made public, leading to uncertainty throughout the auto industry and beyond.

The indicator was triggered by the stock's 50-day moving average falling below the 200-day. Shares have been volatile, down roughly 50% from December highs. Major stock indexes flashed so-called \" death cross \" signals this week. On Tuesday, it was Tesla 's turn. Shares of the EV maker met the definition of a death cross when their 50-day moving average ($288.76) crossed below the 200-day measure ($290.60). The formation has historically been a bearish indicator for the underlying asset. Tesla stock has experienced incredible whiplash in recent months. On the heels of President Donald Trump's election, Tesla \u2014 which was seen as a beneficiary given CEO Elon Musk's close ties to the administration \u2014 soared nearly 100%. But since its mid-December peak at nearly $500 a share, the stock has plunged about 50% as investors' worries have mounted about slowing EV sales and growing protests against the brand . This is the first time Tesla stock flashed a death cross since May 2022, the early days of a brutal bear market sell-off that was sparked by surging inflation and interest rates. Shares of Tesla went on to decline by as much as 54% before it found its bottom in January 2023. It's important to note that the moving-average crossover strategy is a lagging indicator. Therefore, it can flash head fake signals, which occur when a stock quickly rebounds after a \"death cross\" and triggers a \"golden cross\" buy signal. As Ari Wald, the head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., explained to BI last month: \"While every major decline starts with a 'death cross,' not every 'death cross' leads to a major decline.\" Tesla isn't the only stock flashing a bearish death cross. Other notable death crosses hit bitcoin earlier this month and Nvidia in late March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 also flashed a death cross signal on Monday.

I bet most are in China, not the US Share Twitter Linkedin Email Facebook Facebook Messenger Whatsapp Reddit Flipboard By Markus Rach, Marketing professor BiUH China April 15, 2025 | 7 min read Listen to article 4 min Amid Trump\u2019s tariff tit-for-tat with Xi, Dr Markus Rach, an academic and consultant working in the region, believes China\u2019s brands can manage the headwinds better than US rivals. / Adobe Stock When the US threw down the trade gauntlet with China, few expected the fallout to hit American brands harder than Chinese ones. But here we are. In a tit-for-tat tariff slugfest that\u2019s seen duties skyrocket past 100%, the biggest loser isn\u2019t who you think. Not China. Not the US. It\u2019s the brands without global agility. So\u2026 Chinese brands? Want to go deeper? Ask The Drum Well, I know that agility is their default setting. Born in a cutthroat market shaped by an ambiguous regulatory environment, lightning-fast consumer shifts, and brutal competition, they\u2019ve been trained for chaos. Western brands? Less so. Just look at western automotives. Temu is a case study of Chinese adaptability. The ultra-discount marketplace has opened doors in over 100 countries and counting. Alerted by the US's hawkish stance on TikTok, Temu has quietly slashed ad spend in America by over 50%, rechanneling firepower to Europe. As of this week? It has zero Google Shopping ads in the US. Some merchants took a hit. Factories shut. Others shrugged. Why? Their US exposure barely cracked 10%. Advertisement Suppliers in Yiwu, China\u2019s wholesale haven, have started raising prices across Temu, AliExpress, and even Amazon. Their logic? Even pricier Chinese goods are still cheaper (and often better) than Western alternatives. Meanwhile, China\u2019s domestic market is thriving\u2014not because foreign brands pulled away but because local ones have leveled up. The homegrown brand superstar list is growing by the day: DJI, Huawei, BYD, Nio, Xiaomi, Anta, just to name a few. These aren\u2019t scrappy startups. They\u2019re serious contenders with fast product cycles, consumer-centric design, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 emotional brand clout. Starbucks, Apple, Nike, and Tesla, once untouchable, are now being outpaced by local rivals who innovate faster, build cheaper, and, increasingly, appear cooler. And it gets worse for US brands. Advertisement They\u2019re being squeezed out of China, not just by tariffs, but by a wave of pride that\u2019s turbocharging demand for domestic alternatives. Tesla\u2019s decision to stop importing its Model S and X into China? This is less geopolitical protest and more strategic retreat to hide the company\u2019s fading competitiveness in the premium segment. Chinese EVs are cleaner, cooler, more techy and quicker to market. For brands still manufacturing in China, there\u2019s no easy exit. Supply chains are sticky. Moving production is messy, slow, and often futile. Apple\u2019s dramatic iPhone airlift to dodge US price surges is a band-aid solution. Long-term? Expect Made in Malaysia or Vietnam to become more common on your tech gear, such as your Chinese tech gear. But I don\u2019t think this is new. A decade ago, the EU tried a similar move with minimum import prices on Chinese solar panels. Result? Chinese brands side-stepped the rules, built offshore production, and dwarfed local competitors. Today, they dominate the solar market. It was brutal and over before EU politicians got the memo \u2013 trust me, I was there. Western policymakers keep betting on smoke and mirror tactics. But China plays the long game. Fast, flexible, and relentlessly strategic, its brands are proving almost impossible to box in.

Also, this proves Prof G wrong again! China has produced global brands before but never at this rate, scope and impact. Tariffs don\u2019t win markets.

That's likely illegal Skip to content Protestors chant during a demonstration against President Donald Trump\u2019s use of El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, prison for people deported from the U.S. for entering the country illegally, outside the Embassy of El Salvador in Washington, Monday, April 14, 2025. (AP Photo/Nathan Howard) By The Associated Press UPDATED: April 15, 2025 at 9:52 AM MDT By NICHOLAS RICCARDI President Donald Trump on Monday reiterated that he\u2019d like to send U.S. citizens who commit violent crimes to prison in El Salvador, telling that country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, that he\u2019d \u201chave to build five more places\u201d to hold the potential new arrivals. Trump\u2019s administration has already deported immigrants to El Salvador\u2019s notorious mega-prison CECOT , known for its harsh conditions. The president has also said his administration is trying to find \u201clegal\u201d ways to ship U.S. citizens there, too. Trump on Monday insisted these would just be \u201cviolent people,\u201d implying they would be those already convicted of crimes in the United States, though he\u2019s also floated it as a punishment for those who attack Tesla dealerships to protest his administration and its patron, billionaire Elon Musk. But it would likely be a violation of the U.S. Constitution for his administration to send any native-born citizen forcibly into an overseas prison. Indeed, it would likely even violate a provision of a law Trump himself signed during his first term. Here\u2019s a look at the notion of sending U.S. citizens to prison in a foreign country, why it\u2019s likely not legal and some possible legal loopholes. If it\u2019s legal to do to immigrants, why not citizens? Immigrants can be deported from the United States, while citizens cannot. Deportation is covered by immigration law, which does not apply to U.S. citizens. Part of being a citizen means you cannot be forcibly sent to another country. Immigrants can be removed, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening in El Salvador. The country is taking both its own citizens that the United States is sending as well as those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. The Venezuelans sent there last month had no opportunity to respond to evidence against them or appear before a judge. That\u2019s the deal the Trump administration signed with Bukele. The U.S. has sent people to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and elsewhere even when they are not citizens of those countries. But, under international agreements, people cannot be sent to countries where they are likely to be persecuted or tortured. Prisoners look out from their cell at the Terrorist Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador, Friday, April 4, 2025, during a tour by the Costa Rica Justice and Peace minister. (AP Photo/Salvador Melendez) Why does the Trump administration want to send people to El Salvador? Bukele calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dictator\u201d and has cracked down on human rights during his administration. He\u2019s also turned El Salvador from one of the world\u2019s most violent countries into a fairly safe one. Trump has embraced that example, including during the Oval Office visit Monday. Sending immigrants from countries like Venezuela to El Salvador sends a message to would-be migrants elsewhere about the risks of trying to make it to \u2014 or stay in \u2014 the United States.

Gabe Evans Trump administration freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard over campus activism There\u2019s a second benefit to the administration: People sent to El Salvador are outside the jurisdiction of United States courts. Judges, the administration argues, can\u2019t order someone sent to El Salvador to be released or shipped back to the U.S. because the U.S. government no longer has control of them. It\u2019s a potential legal loophole that led Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor to issue a grim warning in her opinion in a 9-0 U.S. Supreme Court finding that the administration could not fly alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador with no court hearing, even after Trump invoked an 18th century law last used during World War II to claim wartime powers. \u201cThe implication of the Government\u2019s position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress,\u201d Sotomayor warned. She was writing to dissent from the majority taking the case from the federal judge who had initially barred the administration from any deportations and had ordered planes en route to El Salvador turned around \u2014 an order the administration apparently ignored . A second case highlights the risks of sending people to El Salvador. The administration admits it sent a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, erroneously to El Salvador. A Salvadoran immigrant, Abrego Garcia, who has not been charged with a crime, had an order against deportation but was shipped to CECOT anyway. On Monday Bukele and Trump scoffed at the idea of sending him back, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return. President Donald Trump, left, greets El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele as Bukele arrives at the White House, Monday, April 14, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Wait, so can they send citizens to El Salvador? Nothing like this has ever been contemplated in U.S. history, but it seems unlikely. There are other legal barriers besides the fact that you cannot deport U.S. citizens. The United States does have extradition treaties with several countries where it will send a citizen accused of a crime in that country to face trial there. That appears to be the only existing way a U.S. citizen can be forcibly removed from the country under current law. The Constitution also prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d and one of CECOT\u2019s selling points is that conditions there are far harsher than in prisons in the U.S. As noted above, federal courts have no jurisdiction there, and that may deprive people sent there of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. \u201cIt is illegal to expatriate U.S. citizens for a crime,\u201d wrote Lauren-Brooke Eisen of the Brennan Center for Social Justice in New York. She noted that even if the administration tries to transfer federal prisoners there, arguing they\u2019re already incarcerated, it could run afoul of the First Step Act that Trump himself championed and signed in 2018. The provision requires that the government try to house federal inmates as close to their homes as possible so their families can visit them \u2014 and indeed transfer anyone housed farther than 500 miles from their home to a closer facility. One last loophole? There is one potential loophole that the administration could use to send a small group of citizens to El Salvador. They can try to strip the citizenship of people who earned it after immigrating to the United States. People who were made U.S. citizens after birth can lose that status for a handful of offenses, like funding terrorist organizations or lying on naturalization forms. They would then revert to green card holders, and would be potentially eligible for deportation if convicted of other, serious crimes. That\u2019s a small, but real, pool of people. Perhaps the most significant thing about it is that it would require loss of citizenship first. In other words, there\u2019s still likely no legal way to force a citizen out of the country. But a few could end up in legal jeopardy anyway.

The latest over-the-air update, dubbed the \u2018Spring Update\u2019, sees a number of new features added across the line-up, with perhaps the most notable of all being Adaptive Headlights for cars in North American and Canada. Both the Model S and Model X have also been catered for with a new blind spot camera video feed in the instrument cluster and an overall upgrade to the Dashcam and Sentry Mode camera coverage will benefit all owners, especially those worried about the prospect of anti-Musk protests . You may like Tesla says it will refresh the Model S and Model X this year \u2013 here are 5 things I want to see Big Rivian update delivers hands-off driving to rival Tesla Autopilot \u2013 and a new 'Rally' mode Here are those Tesla updates and who's getting them... 1. Adaptive headlights arrive in North American and Canada (Image credit: Tesla) Available on Tesla models that feature matrix headlights, the software update will introduce high beams that automatically adapt to avoid blinding oncoming road users. It works by dimming individual pixels, illuminating the parts of the road drivers need without inconveniencing others. The technology and required software has been available in Europe for some time now, but the update, which can be toggled on and off in the Lights setting menu, comes to North American and Canadian customers thanks to recent changes in legislation that now allow for it. Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors That said, adaptive high beam headlights have been commonplace on models from Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and many more for over ten years now, so it\u2019s not exactly a mind-blowing addition to the Tesla tech arsenal. 2. Route planning gets smarter (Image credit: Tesla) Tesla\u2019s route-planning is largely excellent, arguably among the best in the EV business, but it has just got better thanks to clearer choices for multiple route-planning options. There\u2019s now an option labelled \u2018Fastest\u2019 that keeps travel (and charge time) time to the bare minimum, while a \u2018Best amenities\u2019 option prioritizes Supercharger stops near top-rated restaurants, shops and restrooms, according to a Tesla post on X . Users can also manually toggle an option to avoid highways for more scenic drives. Finally, there\u2019s a \u2018Fewer Stops\u2019 that aims to reduce the number of charging stops by taking the most direct and efficient routes. Plus, when scrolling through the various Tesla Supercharger stations, the infotainment system will offer details on any nearby attractions it deems worth visiting. 3. Improvements to Dashcam and Sentry Mode (Image credit: Tesla) For the Model S, 3, X and Y with the latest hardware, Tesla has added footage from the side cameras (mounted in the b-pillars) to both Dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings. This means that the captured camera angles now jump from four to six, which will see pretty much all of the car covered, both when driving and when parked. On top of this, the Dashcam Viewer app has been redesigned with a grid layout option, showing a selection of camera angles on one screen. Users can now more easily navigate the captured footage thanks to quick-swipe video review tools, as well as easily toggle between the various angles captured by all six cameras. 4. You can charge accessories after leaving the vehicle (Image credit: Tesla UK) One subtle feature has been added that allows users to continue using USB ports and phone chargers after exiting and locking the car. The system will keep charging accessories so long as the vehicle\u2019s battery level is above 20%, to ensure there\u2019s enough charge remaining to get drivers to a nearby charging station. It\u2019s a nice addition, but many rival manufacturers deliberately offer accessory outlets in the trunk and/or frunk for this exact purpose. 5. Driver screen gets a blind spot camera (Image credit: Tesla) Rather than having to look down to the central touchscreen when indicating to change lanes, a live feed from the blind spot cameras now appears in the driver display\u2026 but there\u2019s a catch. This update is only available on the refreshed Model S and Model X, which encompasses vehicles made between 2021 and now.

The suspect, Albuquerque resident Jamison Wagner, 40, was charged with two federal counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives in connection to arson attacks at the Tesla Albuquerque Showroom on Feb. 9 and the RPNM headquarters on March 30, according to a Monday DOJ press release . This comes after numerous arrests have been made in connection to attacks on Tesla facilities, with many of the alleged vandals also appearing to be queer-identifying. (RELATED: Most Alleged Tesla Charger Vandals Have One Thing In Common \u2014 \u2018She/They\u2019 Pronouns) Wagner is accused of spray-painting graffiti on six vehicles in red and black paint with the phrases, \u201cDie Elon,\u201d \u201cTesla Nazi Inc\u201d and \u201cDie Tesla Nazi,\u201d along with swastika symbols.

Investigators linked Wagner to both incidents through crime scene evidence and surveillance footage. He will remain in custody until a detention hearing is set, the DOJ said. Wagner faces between five and 20 years in prison for each count if convicted of the current charges, prosecutors say. \u201cThis arrest marks a critical step toward justice in the firebombing that targeted a Tesla dealership and the New Mexico Republican Party Headquarters,\u201d said Deputy Director Robert Cekada of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in the Monday press release. \u201cA key suspect is now in custody thanks to the exceptional work of ATF\u2019s Special Agents, certified fire investigators, and forensic specialists.\u201d Protests and attacks against Tesla and Elon Musk have increased domestically and internationally in light of Musks\u2019 involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration. \u201cHurling firebombs is not political protest,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in the press release. \u201cIt is a dangerous felony that we will prosecute to the maximum extent. The impressive work by law enforcement in New Mexico sends a clear message to perpetrators of all of the shameful attacks on Tesla facilities and political establishments: we are coming for you, you can\u2019t hide, and you will do serious jail time to pay for your crimes.\u201d The Department of Justice announced federal charges in March against three people who set fire to Tesla dealerships in Oregon, Colorado and South Carolina, and additional arrests have been made more recently. Bondi branded the \u201cswarm of violent attacks\u201d as \u201cnothing short of domestic terrorism\u201d in a statement on March 18.

After President Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, China retaliated by halting all rare earth shipments \u2014 minerals crucial for tech, auto, aerospace, and defense industries. With ports blocked and export licenses on hold, industries worldwide face severe shortages. The U.S. is scrambling for alternatives in Greenland, Ukraine, and deep-sea mining. This rare earth showdown isn\u2019t just a trade war move \u2014 it\u2019s a wake-up call for the global economy. China's rare earth export freeze sparks global panic, halts critical tech and defense supplies, and hits U.S., Japan, and Germany hard. Trade war deepens as industries scramble for new sources China\u2019s rare earth export freeze is no longer just a U.S.-China trade issue \u2014 it\u2019s gone global. After President Donald Trump rolled out a new round of \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on April 2 \u2014 dubbed \u201cLiberation Day\u201d by the administration \u2014 China hit back swiftly. Two days later, Beijing halted rare earth exports to all countries, not just the U.S., setting off alarm bells in the tech, automotive, aerospace, and defense industries worldwide. With China controlling the lion\u2019s share of rare earth production \u2014 over 70% of global supply \u2014 this move could severely disrupt critical manufacturing sectors across the globe. According to The New York Times , China\u2019s retaliatory action has effectively paused all exports of rare earth minerals and magnets made from them, as customs authorities are now requiring special licenses that don\u2019t yet exist in practice. Why did China suddenly freeze rare earth exports? The rare earth freeze is directly tied to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. On April 2, President Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs targeting hundreds of billions in Chinese imports. Just two days later, on April 4, China imposed its own set of retaliatory duties \u2014 but with an added punch: strict export controls on rare earth elements. These controls mean any rare earth export from China now requires a special license. But here\u2019s the catch \u2014 China hasn\u2019t set up a system to issue those licenses yet. That\u2019s created a bottleneck at ports, where shipments are being held up across the board. As reported by The New York Times , customs officials are blocking rare earth exports not just to the U.S., but also to allies like Japan and Germany. The move was enforced jointly by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs, who also barred Chinese businesses from dealing with American firms, especially those in defense. Live Events How dependent is the world on China\u2019s rare earths? China isn\u2019t just a top player in rare earths \u2014 it\u2019s the player. The country produces about 70% of the world\u2019s rare earth elements and refines an even greater share. These minerals are essential for producing everything from smartphones and electric vehicle batteries to guided missiles and fighter jets. For the U.S. alone, rare earths are a critical input for: Electric vehicles (EVs) Wind turbines Semiconductors Fighter jets and drones China\u2019s rare earth exports are relatively small in dollar value, but they have massive strategic importance. This gives China an asymmetric advantage in trade wars \u2014 they can inflict serious damage without hurting their own economy much. Which industries are most at risk from the export freeze? The impact of China\u2019s rare earth restrictions is already being felt across sectors. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of who\u2019s feeling the heat: Tech Industry : Smartphones, chips, and hard drives all rely on rare earth components. The U.S. recently rolled out exemptions for some tech-related tariffs, but that hasn\u2019t helped with China\u2019s halted magnet shipments. Auto Sector : EV makers like Tesla and legacy automakers alike need rare earths for motors and batteries. A prolonged freeze could drive up costs or slow production. Aerospace and Defense : From radar systems to stealth fighters, rare earths are critical. The freeze could seriously impact the U.S. military supply chain \u2014 which is why China specifically blocked defense-related exports. Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, said on Monday, \u201cRare earths are a part of lots of the economy,\u201d adding that the government is \u201cstudying the limits very carefully.\u201d How is the U.S. responding to the rare earth squeeze? The Trump administration isn\u2019t standing still. Over the last month, the White House has made several moves to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earths: Executive order : Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to identify U.S.-based rare earth mines and land for extraction. Greenland push : Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland, home to one of the world\u2019s largest known rare earth deposits. Trump has said the U.S. \u201cneeds Greenland for national security and even international security.\u201d Ukraine deal : The U.S. is negotiating with Ukraine for what Trump has described as \u201c$500 billion worth of rare earths.\u201d Seafloor mining : Another executive order is in the works to support the stockpiling of deep-sea metals, which could be key to future rare earth independence. Despite these efforts, experts say it could take years to rebuild domestic production and processing capabilities. Could this rare earth crisis lead to long-term supply chain changes? It\u2019s looking more likely. Global manufacturers are now being forced to rethink their supply chains. Japan and the EU have already begun seeking alternative sources in countries like Australia and Malaysia. The U.S., too, is now racing to diversify. That said, there\u2019s no quick fix. Setting up rare earth mining and processing infrastructure is expensive, environmentally sensitive, and time-consuming. Until then, industries around the world remain vulnerable to China\u2019s next move \u2014 and Beijing knows it.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 China's embassy in Washington, D.C., has shared an image contrasting the country's rail infrastructure with that of the United States in a pointed jab at Beijing's rival amid simmering trade tensions. Why It Matters The image, posted Sunday on the Chinese embassy's Facebook page, followed President Donald Trump 's latest escalation of the U.S.-China trade war, on Friday raising the blanket tariff on Chinese goods to 145 percent. A tariff is a tax on imports that is typically passed on to consumers. The trade tiff has been accompanied by increasingly forceful rhetoric. Last week, U.S. Vice President JD Vance caused a stir on Chinese social media by saying Americans \"borrow money from Chinese peasants\" only to purchase the things they manufacture. What To Know The Chinese embassy's graphic contrasts a fleet of sleek, Chinese high-speed passenger trains with an older American freight train listing slightly on a crumbling track. \" China Vs. USA,\" the post read alongside three Chinese flag emojis. The post drew a range of reactions. One Facebook user accused the embassy of \"cherry picking.\" \"We don't need trains. we love to drive ourselves with our beautiful cars,\" another wrote. \"Yeah, the train system is awful in the U.S.,\" one commenter said. \"You got bullet trains that run all over Japan, and we can't even get a high-speed rail system built from LA to San Francisco.\" \"This is how countries should fight each other: meme war,\" said another person. This meme, shared by the Chinese embassy in the U.S., takes aim at U.S. rail infrastructure by comparing it to that of China's high speed train fleets. This meme, shared by the Chinese embassy in the U.S., takes aim at U.S. rail infrastructure by comparing it to that of China's high speed train fleets. Chinese Embassy The post follows AI-generated images that went viral last week. They depict Americans\u2014including Trump and his adviser, Tesla CEO Elon Musk \u2014laboring in a factory, mocking Trump's push to restore U.S. manufacturing. And on Friday, Chinese state media released a diss track styled after American pop, with lyrics predicting the trade war's toll on ordinary Americans, including lines like \"Groceries cost a kidney, gas a lung.\" Since launching its first high-speed rail line in 2008, China has built the world's largest network\u2014about 25,000 miles, more than twice the combined length of all other countries' systems. Heavy investment in rail and other infrastructure helped the country weather the 2008 global financial crisis, but it also left the state-owned China State Railway Group with nearly $900 billion in debt, causing the state-owned operator to raise ticket prices for the first time on major routes last summer. What People Are Saying Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., told Newsweek : \"Over the past decades, China has made major strides in infrastructure development. That has laid a solid foundation for economic and social development. \"The ultimate goal of these efforts has always been to improve our people's lives. In transport, for example, with such efforts, travel has become so much easier and the flow of goods smoother across the country.\" What Happens Next In what China called a \" small step ,\" Trump walked back his latest tariff hikes on key made-in-China electronics, such as chips and computers, keeping them at the 20 percent rate set in March. The president rejected media characterizations of the move as an exemption, saying the products were being reviewed. Trump argues the tariffs will revive U.S. manufacturing, but experts across the political spectrum remain skeptical. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen dismissed the idea as a \"pipe dream\" during a Monday interview with CNBC.

According to the latest polling averages aggregated by statistician Nate Silver , the richest man in the world's favorability is in free-fall, with a mere 39.4 percent of Americans seeing Musk positively, while a majority of 52.7 percent see him negatively. In total, that's a net favorability of -11 points \u2014 a significant drop since Donald Trump took office at the beginning of the year, when it stood at -3 points, and a stomach-churning plunge from 2016, when his favorability was a glowing +29 . We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125. pic.twitter.com/X4IIvLIhmk \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) April 11, 2025 The latest numbers highlight an astonishing degree of disillusionment with Musk's indiscriminate and sloppy slashing of government budgets with the help of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. His embrace of far-right extremist views has also proven extremely polarizing, with the billionaire going as far as to perform two Nazi salutes during Trump's post-inauguration celebration. Anti-Musk sentiment has risen considerably since then, inspiring an entire movement, called Tesla Takedown, which has seen thousands of people peacefully demonstrating in front of the EV maker's dealerships. The carmaker has seen its sales plummet as a result across the globe. Many investors have also grown fed up with Musk's antics and refusal to fully commit his time to the company. How much longer Musk will continue to gut the government remains to be seen. Trump recently suggested he could be out in the coming months. Experts have since speculated that Musk's unpopularity could be a political liability for the president, who's battling issues with his own favorability. Trump's ratings have dipped this month , following a disastrous rollout of global tariffs. \"Although Musk may eventually leave the government, he\u2019ll remain an exceptionally important and controversial public figure even if he does,\" Silver wrote. \"Until then, he could be a liability for Trump because he\u2019s less popular than the president is even as Trump\u2019s numbers have also declined.\" The cracks are already starting to show. After Musk threw $25 million behind Republican judge Brad Schimel , who ran against liberal candidate judge Susan Crawford during a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this month, Crawford beat Schimel handily. It was a resounding defeat for Musk, who went as far as to hand out $1 million checks to voters in a desperate bid to sway election results. Could his backfiring political efforts be a sign of what's still to come? Given that he's widely expected to leave his post at DOGE \u2014 while potentially falling comically far short of his initial goal of excising $2 trillion from the government budget \u2014 it remains to be seen whether surging anti-Musk sentiment will die down again. But now that Tesla's brand has been raked through the mud, it'll likely take some time for his favorability to recover.

TIL Creatives Amid a dramatic downturn in the stock market earlier this month, prompted by sweeping tariff announcements, investor sentiment remained surprisingly resilient. Data released by major investment firms suggests that while trading activity spiked, the vast majority of retail investors refrained from panic-selling and instead stayed committed to their long-term strategies. The turbulence between April 3 and 9 offered a rare real-time case study of investor behavior under stress. Vanguard, Schwab, and BlackRock each reported a similar pattern: a market in distress met by a largely composed investor base, as mentioned in a report by USA Today. Panic in the Market, Calm in the Response On April 2, U.S. President Donald Trump announced broad-based tariffs affecting global trade. This triggered a cascade of market reactions. Live Events By April 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen nearly 1,700 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded their worst losses since 2020. The situation worsened by April 4 after China retaliated with tariffs of its own. Despite the unsettling headlines and sharp declines, investor behavior particularly among self-directed clients remained calm. Vanguard\u2019s internal data indicated that only 8.4% of its investors made trades during the volatile period. Even among this small subset, most traded only once during the week, and buyers outnumbered sellers five to one. James Martielli, head of investment and trading services at Vanguard, observed, \u201cThe vast majority of our self-directed investors stayed the course. We saw adherence to long-term plans, not reactionary moves\u201d, as quoted in a report by USA Today. Schwab and BlackRock Echo Similar Trends Charles Schwab, another major retail investment firm, also recorded high trading activity on April 3. However, according to Patrick Means, vice president at the firm\u2019s Dallas branch, the mood was more proactive than panic-driven. \u201cThere was no wave of selling. People were looking to buy,\u201d said Alex Coffey, Schwab\u2019s senior trading strategist. Popular purchases included blue-chip tech stocks such as Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla, as well as exchange-traded funds (ETFs)\u2014an apparent effort to manage risk amid volatility. Kristy Akullian of BlackRock noted a similar sentiment: \u201cClients weren\u2019t asking, \u2018What should I sell?\u2019 but rather \u2018What should I buy?\u2019\u201d BlackRock hosted online guidance sessions, reinforcing long-term principles and discouraging emotional decision-making. Investment Wisdom Amid Uncertainty Experts emphasized time-tested principles for navigating a distressed stock market: Avoid timing the market: Investors often miss the best rebound days by trying to sell before a fall and buy back at the bottom. For instance, after days of steep losses, markets surged on April 9 when Trump paused his tariff drive. Stick to the plan: Historical data supports long-term investing. Since 1966, average bear markets have lasted about 15 months, compared to nearly six years for bull markets. Buy when prices dip: The April turmoil created buying opportunities, especially for those favoring index funds or low-volatility investment options. FAQs What caused the recent downturn in the stock market? The downturn was triggered by sweeping tariff announcements from U.S. President Donald Trump on April 2, 2025. These trade policies, especially those targeting China, rattled global markets and caused a sharp decline in major indices. How severe was the market reaction? By April 3, the Dow Jones had plunged nearly 1,700 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw their steepest losses since 2020. The situation worsened after China retaliated with its own set of tariffs.

Join For Free Did you ever feel like working with AI frameworks is like having a conversation with a boring husband ( as per 99.99% wives ) who only answers when asked but never takes the initiative? In one of my previous blogs, we discussed LangChain , which opened up the possibility of chaining together different AI models and tools. But here\u2019s the catch: LangChain and similar frameworks are fundamentally reactive. They answer questions, process inputs, and carry out predefined steps, but they don\u2019t exactly \u201cthink\u201d for themselves or solve complex workflows automatically. This is where the need for agentic frameworks arises. So, what are these \u201cAgentic\u201d frameworks? And why do we need them? Think of them as the difference between giving a person a list of tasks versus giving them a goal and letting them figure out the best way to achieve it. Agentic frameworks make AI applications not just responsive but proactive, goal-oriented, and capable of handling dynamic, real-world challenges. What Is an Agentic Framework? A framework designed to build agents \u2014 pieces of software that act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Unlike typical pipelines or workflows that require explicit instructions at every step, agents leverage context, reasoning, and goal-setting to determine the best course of action on their own. In short, they\u2019re built to \u201cfigure it out.\u201d Let\u2019s take a real-world example. Imagine building a virtual personal assistant app. Without an agentic approach, you\u2019d have to specify each step \u2014 \u201ccheck emails,\u201d find today\u2019s tasks,\u201d \u201csort by priority,\u201d etc. But with such a framework, you could set a goal, like \u201chelp me plan my day,\u201d and the agent would determine what tasks to prioritize based on context \u2014 like you calendar, emails, and meeting notes. Why Do We Need Agentic Frameworks? Let\u2019s look at a popular GenAI application like ChatGPT. Right now, when you ask ChatGPT for help, it responds to each prompt individually, with no memory of prior conversations ( beyond the current session ) and no ability to self-initiate actions or goals. For example, if you ask the app to \u201chelp me plan my day,\u201d it will suggest a schedule, but it won\u2019t proactively update it or remind you as the day progresses. Each time you want an update, you\u2019d need to come back and provide more specific prompts. Without agentic frameworks, GenAI tools remain fundamentally reactive. They\u2019re great at answering questions, generating responses, and even assisting with structured tasks, but they rely on user-driver commands. Every step requires user input, and they can\u2019t autonomously manage goals or make ongoing adjustments to fit changing needs. Here\u2019s Why They Are Essential: Handling uncertainty : In real-world applications, data is rarely as predictable or structured as we\u2019d like. An agentic framework can adapt to changing conditions, like fluctuating data or unforeseen variables, without needing constant reprogramming. Optimizing efficiency : They allow AI to make decisions about resource allocation, speeding up processes. For example, an agentic AI could \u201cdecide\u201d to prioritize urgent tasks during peak hours or process less critical tasks when server loads are low. Reducing human oversight : With traditional frameworks ( yes, that\u2019s so last week/month/year ), developers or operators ( like you and me ) constantly tweak workflows to align with updated goals or data. An agentic framework reduced this need, allowing AI to adjust its behavior autonomously based on higher-level objectives. How Agentic Frameworks Work: The Core Components Most agentic frameworks operate using a combination of these key components: Goal definition : You specify a high-level objective rather than a rigid series of steps. Context awareness : The framework maintains and uses context about its environment or previous interactions. Reasoning and decision-making : The agent evaluates different actions to determine the best path forward. Feedback loops : Feedback loops let agents learn from past actions to improve their responses. Let\u2019s try to visualize the difference in processing. Enough stories, I guess; let\u2019s try creating a basic agent with Python . Python import random class StockAgent: def __init__(self, stocks): self.stocks = stocks # Dict of stock symbols and values def evaluate_market(self): # Randomnly decide if the market is up or down return \"up\" if random.choice([True, False]) else \"down\" def adjust_portfolio(self): market_condition = self.evaluate_market() if market_condition == \"up\": print(\"Market is up! Holding stocks.\") else: print(\"Market is down! Considering adjustments...\") # Sell high-risk stocks or adjust allocation based on context for stock, value in self.stocks.items(): if value < 50: print(f\"Selling {stock} to mitigate risk.\") else: print(f\"Keeping {stock}, as it's performing well.\") def monitor(self): print(\"Monitoring portfolio...\") self.adjust_portfolio() # Initialize agent with sample stock data stocks = (\"AAPL\": 120, \"TSLA\": 45, \"AMZN\": 200) agent = StockAgent(stocks) # Run the agent agent.monitor() This is a simple agent that checks the market condition and makes autonomous decisions based on a few pre-defined rules. In a more advanced framework, this agent would access real-time data, assess long-term goals (like maximizing profit), and adapt its strategy over time. Existing Agentic Frameworks: Langchain and Beyond Langchain has its own set of agents, but other frameworks are emerging that specialize in agentic capabilities. For example, Auto-GPT is an experimental project that chains tasks autonomously, allowing the agent to pursue a high-level objective without explicit step-by-step guidance. Similarly, GPT-Engineer uses an agentic approach to help generate code iteratively, simulating an autonomous coding partner. Key Challenges in Building Agentic Frameworks Agentic frameworks aren\u2019t a cure-all, and they come with their own challenges: Complexity in debugging : Since agents act on their own, understanding why they made a certain decision can be challenging. Resource intensity : Agents require ongoing processing power to evaluate conditions and make decisions dynamically. Ensuring security and ethics : Autonomous agents operating with little oversight can inadvertently take actions that violate privacy or ethical guidelines. Conclusion: Embracing the Agentic Mindset Agentic frameworks offer a powerful way to build AI applications that go beyond simply reacting. They allow us to create systems that understand goals, act with autonomy, and adapt to new data \u2014 all with minimal intervention. It isn\u2019t a magic bullet but a critical step towards making AI applications more intelligent, adaptive, and useful in complex, real-world environments. As we move forward, expect agentic frameworks to become foundational tools for developers looking to build applications that can truly handle dynamic, ever-changing tasks.

When you need MAGA and Proud Boys to counter-protest for your brand, you know your brand is in trouble. The \u2018 Tesla Takedown \u2018 movement is a grassroots movement that has been organizing peaceful protests at Tesla stores throughout the US. Their goal is to encourage a boycott of Tesla, which they see as Elon Musk\u2019s personal piggy bank to finance the rise of what they believe is Trump\u2019s authoritarian regime and fascism. Advertisement - scroll for more content Every weekend for the past two months, they have been holding growing protests at dozens of Tesla locations across the US. There have been quite a few altercations with Trump supporters counter-protesting, but we are now starting to see full-fledged counter-protests by MAGA supporters and even far-right neo-fascist groups, like the Proud Boys . At Tesla\u2019s store in Rocklin, California, MAGA came by the dozens to counter-protest a Tesla protest with a barrage of gasoline trucks in front of the store: The problem in MAGA\u2019s logic here is that their counter-protests might be just as effective at deterring potential buyers as Tesla Takedown\u2019s protests. Who wants to go through that to buy a car? Proud Boys members were also reportedly at the event. While there were some interactions between the Tesla protestors and counter-protestors, no significant incidents were reported. Interestingly, not a single one of these MAGA counter-protestors had a Tesla vehicle. Based on the videos, they all showed up to support Tesla in gasoline trucks. Electrek\u2019s Take I\u2019m not gonna lie. I don\u2019t know what timeline we are in right now, but it\u2019s a pretty funny one. A bunch of MAGA climate-deniers and Proud Boys neo-fascists are showing up to \u201cprotect\u201d Tesla against left-leaning protestors who see Elon Musk as using Tesla to finance the rise of fascism in the US. Just a few years ago, I never thought I would write that. It\u2019s becoming harder for people to argue that Trump is not authoritarian and fascist, as his administration is now openly defying a 9-0 Supreme Court order to help bring back someone that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted they mistakenly deported and is now in a foreign prison. Top comment by HalfwitWizard Liked by 78 people It's almost like a cartoon. People are protesting Tesla and not buying Tesla products who themselves are being counter protested by people who also refuse to buy Tesla but for a completely different reason. Weirdly enough they both exist in a universe where they're on the same side as long as they don't talk about why they're not buying a Tesla. View all comments Defying a Supreme Court order is as authoritarian as it gets, and deporting people into a foreign prison without due process is fascist, giving weight to the Tesla Takedown argument that Musk, by financing Trump\u2019s election, is financing the rise of fascism in the US. Meanwhile, Musk recently admitted that his DOGE effort is not working. He first claimed he thought that he could cut $2 trillion. He decreased that to $1 trillion last year. Last week, he said that he now believes DOGE can save the US about $150 billion in 2026, when his DOGE mandate ends. At the same time, Trump is talking about increasing spending and cutting taxes, which will increase the US deficit, which was the whole reason for DOGE. It looks like Musk destroyed his reputation for nothing. Add Electrek to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

USAID programs demonstrate a moral commitment that Americans today urgently need to preserve, not destroy. Arnold Isaacs Share Copy Link Facebook X (Twitter) Bluesky Pocket Email Ad Policy Employees and supporters protest outside the headquarters for United States Agency for International Development (USAID), on Monday, February 3, 2025, after Elon Musk posted on social media that he and President Donald Trump would shut down the agency. (Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com . What put the US Agency for International Development (USAID), with an annual budget hovering at just about 1 percent of federal spending, at the top of Elon Musk\u2019s budget-cutting target list? Was it just a political calculation that foreign aid is a safe target because it\u2019s unpopular with so many Americans and cutting those funds will only hurt foreigners, not US voters? Or was Musk motivated by some other grudge we haven\u2019t even heard about? A related question: Why is his invective about that particular agency\u2014\u201c a criminal organization ,\u201d \u201c a viper\u2019s nest of radical-left Marxists who hate America ,\u201d and similar blasts\u2014so much more inflammatory in tone and content than his statements about other government programs? As reported by various news organizations , one of Musk\u2019s principal influencers on this issue appears to have been a man named Mike Benz, who served in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and briefly in the State Department during President Trump\u2019s first term. Benz has spent the last few years promoting implausible conspiracy theories about USAID\u2014that it played a key role in paying for the 2019 attempt to impeach Trump, that it financed the creation of the Covid virus in a Chinese laboratory, that it funds \u201call the terrorist groups in Pakistan [and] terrorist groups in the Sahel in Africa,\u201d and numerous other wildly exaggerated or completely unfounded charges. Benz seems to have been the source of a number of Musk\u2019s specific allegations, most of them unsupported by any evidence, about corrupt or unjustified foreign aid projects. This record leads to another question: What does Elon Musk really know about US foreign aid, the agency staff that delivers it, or the people who receive it? Besides listening to Mike Benz\u2019s falsehoods, has he made any effort to do his own investigation? Has he ever personally seen a recipient of US foreign aid, or someone whose job is to deliver it? Has he ever come face to face with a West African who depends on USAID for lifesaving medicine against deadly tropical disease, or a family driven from their home by war in Afghanistan , Sudan , or Ukraine , or one of the hundreds of thousands of hungry children in Haiti who face starvation without USAID food assistance? Has he ever spoken directly with anyone who could tell him firsthand about the work USAID staffers do, the people they help, or the hardships and dangers they often face on the job? Someone like Christine Sheckler perhaps? A Life Helping Others Christine Sheckler, now retired, spent 27 years working for USAID, including two years in wartime Iraq. Other postings included tours in Sierra Leone, then recovering from a decade of civil war that had left 50,000 people dead and driven more than two million from their homes, as well as in several former Soviet republics, Pakistan, and other countries. In the real world, it\u2019s an all-but-sure bet that she will never have a conversation with Elon Musk, but I\u2019ve wondered what such a conversation might have been like, and whether Musk might have modified his views in any way after listening to her\u2014say, as a start, about her experiences in Iraq. Current Issue May 2025 Issue Sheckler served in Iraq from 2008 to 2010, the years when Musk was putting his first Teslas on the road and (one can guess) paying little attention, or possibly none at all, to America\u2019s already disastrous war in Iraq, Americans serving there, or the war\u2019s impact on Iraqi civilians. She did not spend those years in the Green Zone , the well-protected seven-square-mile enclave in Baghdad where the American embassy and buildings housing the Iraqi government stood behind concrete and barbed-wire barriers and checkpoints manned by US and other allied troops who controlled all traffic into or out of the area. Sheckler was based in the much more dangerous Red Zone, in the district of Abu Ghraib, a prominent staging area for insurgent attacks (and the site of the notorious prison of the same name where American troops brutalized Iraqi inmates). \u201cIt was hard,\u201d Sheckler says, recalling her time there. \u201cEvery minute was dangerous.\u201d In the course of her work, focused on helping farmers, small-business owners, and local governments, she regularly traveled to less secure areas of the region, often meeting with local sheikhs. In those meetings, she took off her helmet and other protective gear, a \u201ccalculated risk,\u201d to avoid sending a message that she didn\u2019t trust the Iraqis she was dealing with. On two occasions, her work put her in immediate danger. The first was at a small building in downtown Baghdad where Sheckler had attended a meeting of the Baghdad local city council. She had just left in an armored vehicle (the type commonly called an MRAP, for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected), heading for the nearby US embassy, and had ridden only a few blocks when the driver was ordered to turn around because the city council had just been attacked. After parking a block away, in case of another attack, Sheckler and several other passengers walked the rest of the way back to the council building, where a suicide bomber driving a vehicle loaded with explosives had been stopped by a barricade in front of the building and had then smashed into a parked MRAP outside the wall, setting off his blast. The bomber was killed, along with the driver and a passenger in a taxi following his vehicle, but although the explosion shattered parts of the roof of the council building and blew out all its windows, showering the people inside with broken glass, \u201cby some miracle,\u201d as Sheckler put it, there were no other casualties. Some months later, she was riding in a vehicle immediately behind the Humvee (a military truck) at the head of a convoy, when a small white car coming from the opposite direction rolled to a stop a short way ahead. From her car, just 20 feet behind the lead vehicle, she saw a man get out with a phone in his hand, which he then used to set off an EFP (an explosively formed penetrator , a projectile carrying a superheated copper warhead that can be launched from a distance and punch through most protective armor). The blast blew the Humvee into the air, sending it flying into a pasture on the far side of the road, wounding the three soldiers and a civilian riding in it. The most seriously wounded was the driver, who lost his right leg below the knee and suffered a shattered lower left leg and massive internal and external burns. Sheckler knew him and all her convoy soldiers, since the same unit escorted her every day on her travels around the district. The Nation Weekly Fridays . A weekly digest of the best of our coverage.

Sign Up A project she remembers with particular pride from her time in Iraq was the reconstruction of the University of Baghdad College of Agriculture, located in Abu Ghraib, which had been completely destroyed earlier in the war. With USAID help, the college was rebuilt, including a room with audiovisual equipment so students and instructors could communicate with other schools. When it reopened, the school offered local farmers training in improved methods of irrigation and water use, helping to revive dairy farming and grain harvests in a vital food-producing region. It was an \u201cimportant partnership,\u201d Sheckler said, which not only benefited Iraqi farmers but also significantly changed local feeling about the American presence, as one sheikh after another told her at a farewell meeting at the end of her tour. \u201cWhen Christine came here two years ago, we hated America and we hated the American people,\u201d she remembers one of them saying as they sent her off with a gift. \u201cBut if Christine represents the American people, we love the American people.\u201d Summing up her time in Iraq, Sheckler remembers not just the danger and her arduous daily schedule (\u201c6 am to after midnight, pretty much every day\u201d) but the immense satisfaction she drew from the work she did. \u201cWe spent a lot of money doing supergood things and I am superproud of that.\u201d She\u2019s no less proud of her work in other countries, particularly during local council elections in the African country of Sierra Leone, where women hoped for more representation in a society in which, as one international think tank reported in 2009 during Sheckler\u2019s tour there, \u201cGender relations\u2026are extremely unequal and Sierra Leonean women face high levels of exclusion, violence, and poverty.\u201d Gender inequality became a more visible issue in the aftermath of the 1990s civil war there, when huge numbers of women became victims of sexual violence or endured devastating hunger and poverty after their husbands were killed. Working with a team from the National Democratic Institute , a nongovernmental organization, Sheckler helped bring female ministers and parliamentarians from all over Africa to find local women throughout Sierra Leone with leadership skills and meet, encourage, and mentor women candidates in the elections. The delegation traveled around the country, riding in old vehicles on rough roads, often crossing paths with Sheckler, who was also on the move to monitor and evaluate the results of the election strategy and leadership training. In the end, in a genuine breakthrough, women won 20 percent of the local council seats, up from 11 percent in the previous councils. That result left Sheckler feeling \u201csuperproud,\u201d not just about her own contribution but perhaps more importantly about \u201cthe strength, wisdom, determination, and resilience of the Sierra Leonean women\u201d she had worked with. Ad Policy Would Musk Listen? Now, let\u2019s return to Elon Musk, and imagine the Tesla chief and DOGE warrior\u2019s conversation with Sheckler. Obviously, there\u2019s no way to know if hearing her reminiscences would have moderated any of his opinions or policy decisions when it came to the utter dismantling of AID. Possibly, perhaps probably, no one like her would change his thinking an iota. This is the guy, after all, who believes that empathy is \u201c the fundamental weakness of Western civilization \u201d because it can supposedly be, as he put it, \u201cweaponized\u201d by enemies to exploit our humane impulses for sinister purposes. And one wonders if Musk can even begin to comprehend a life built around helping other people, or any other purpose except personal gain. He may think that American soldiers have no obligation to ease civilian suffering in war\u2014a view that President Trump\u2019s defense secretary Pete Hegseth apparently adopted as official policy when he moved to shut down the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response office and other Defense Department programs aimed at preventing civilian harm (or at least responding to it) during US combat operations. Accordingly, rather than thanking Sheckler for her work in Iraq, he might argue that she should never have been sent there in the first place. Similarly, it would be no surprise if Musk believes that the United States has no business interfering with the oppression of women in Sierra Leone or anywhere else, and so sees Sheckler\u2019s project there and similar programs elsewhere not as steps toward greater fairness but as a pure waste of American taxpayer dollars (if, indeed, he accepts the idea that women\u2019s rights are a legitimate issue in the first place, which is by no means a certainty).

As a possible alternative, she could tell her stories to Republican members of Congress, particularly those who loudly proclaim their Christian faith, which might suggest a different view from Musk\u2019s about empathy (though again I wouldn\u2019t count on it). In that scenario, if Sheckler manages to speak with any senators or representatives, perhaps she could see them together with Nicholas Kristof, the New York Times journalist whose eyewitness reporting in Sudan and Kenya documented the deaths of a number of children and adults directly attributed to the suspension of US foreign aid programs\u2014conclusively refuting Musk\u2019s false claim that no one had died because of the USAID cutback. Maybe listening to Sheckler and Kristof together would persuade at least a few Republican lawmakers to break their shameful silence. Perhaps they would not only speak out against Musk\u2019s and Trump\u2019s assault on USAID, but act to restore fired employees and reinstate discontinued aid programs. That would not save lives already lost or prevent many more unnecessary deaths caused by the interruptions in AID programs that have already occurred but could help limit the toll in future years. So far, regrettably, there\u2019s no sign that anything like that will happen. When Musk, Trump, and their subordinates speak about USAID programs or government spending in general, they incessantly repeat the words \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d Waste is a legitimate issue, more so in some agencies than others. But by any realistic standard, fraud and abuse come overwhelmingly from the Trump-Musk side, not from federal employees. Fraud is the right word for their false reasoning and wildly exaggerated claims of dollars saved, and the record shows abuses too numerous to count\u2014 false claims of poor performance by fired government workers, disrupting mental health services for veterans , attempting to intimidate judges whose rulings they don\u2019t like, and closing the door on refugees who had already been approved for admission to the United States (including many Afghans who fought alongside American troops in the failed war against the Taliban). And don\u2019t forget the once-preventable deaths of many thousands of people who would have lived if USAID had continued its work in their countries\u2014the work that people like Christine Sheckler and thousands of other staffers did all over the world, demonstrating a moral commitment that Americans today urgently need to preserve, not destroy.

Trump\u2019s catastrophic \u201cLiberation Day\u201d has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Uber Cash, which is valid for 30 days after reflecting in a user\u2019s account, can be used for future Uber rides. The update follows a similar Uber x Waymo launch in Austin. After opening an interest list in February, Uber officially rolled out the service to the Texas capital in March. Last week, Waymo also announced that it's ready to hit the streets in Tokyo . Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous ridesharing service in Austin this June. It\u2019s unclear if the Elon Musk-led company will have its own app for the service (Waymo has Waymo One ), but Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is open to adding Tesla robotaxis to the Uber app, too.

Trump has further increased tariffs on the country, and last week a Michigan senator introduced a bill to outright ban Chinese cars in the U.S. \u2014 nevermind the fact that none are even sold here. It's really a shame, as Chinese automakers are putting out some of the best designs in the world, with some of the best technology and engineering, and all at very competitive prices. Chinese brands are growing fast in places like Europe and Mexico, and it feels inevitable that they'll reach our shores. That brought me to my question from last week. I asked our readers what awesome Chinese cars they think we're missing out on here in America , and y'all brought some good variety to your answers. My example was the Zeekr Mix, a fantastically weird egg-shaped minivan with swiveling seats, no B-pillars and a long range, but you guys picked everything from super-cheap hatchbacks to roadsters with scissor doors. Keep reading to see all the best answers. Wuling Mini EV The little Wuling thing, that kinda looks like the Citroen Ami. I don't believe they're sold here, but I have saw one at a gym here in SC before. Suggested by: Noturbestfriend There's even a convertible version! Nio ET5T I'm absolutely down bad for the Nio ET5t, it's like a cuter Volvo V60 Suggested by: Intern6 Honestly all of Nio's products seem fantastic, but of course we're especially here for a wagon. Lynk & Co 03+ Lynk & Co 03+. A high performance sports sedan that made it into Forza Horizon 5. Suggested by: Nicholas Chuck What you really want is the 03+ TCR Cyan that's inspired by the race car. Xiaomi SU7 While my personal fav is the Temu Taycan (the Xiaomi SU7) simply based on the looks/power/price-point argument, I have to simply say: ALL OF THEM China is way ahead of the US in terms of car technology. LiDAR, lasers, camera side mirrors, fast charging, etc etc. In terms of build quality, they put most of the other makers to shame, especially Tesla. They build sedans! Can you imagine? And properly sized cars too, not just massive bricks on wheels. There is a VERY good reason they are not sold here. It would destroy the marketplace we've been protecting for decades. Maybe tariffs can help with that?? **I'll let myself out, don't forget to tip the waitress. Suggested by: Greg Codori It's not surprising the SU7 has been a huge hit in China \u2014 Ford's CEO has even gushed about how good it is . MG Cyberster I'd go with the MG Cyberster. I saw a Cyberster in Lima a little while back. They're pretty nice machines. I think I could convince my wife to let me trade my Miata for one, even at the price it might have been before these idiotic tariffs. Suggested by: seanjohntx, Give Me Tacos or Give Me Death God, the Cyberster is so cool. BYD Seagull BYD Seagull... The starting price is around $7,800! That is a bargain for a 4 door hatchback. A dirt cheap EV like that would really allow more people the opportunity to own an EV. Suggested by: Olde Farte I just love BYD's latest ocean animal naming theme. MG4 EV Lots of people talk about wanting inexpensive but reasonably made cars. To me, the MG4 fits that bill. Got a base model last year when they were US$18,290 drive away (now US$20,000). Not fancy, nor feature-packed, but it is quiet, comfortable, gets up to 400km around town (290km on the highway), drives very well, and costs very little to charge with my solar system. Software needs work, but hopefully that will come. Suggested by: Beau Dangles The MG4 has been really well received in Europe, and there's even an XPower version with 429 horsepower. Yangwang U8 The awfully named Yangwang U8 is ridiculous. 1200hp, integrated range extender so range is no issue, 0-60 in 3.6 seconds and unlike the cybertwat it can actually float. They even have a model with an integrated drone that launches from the roof. Suggested by: Jeff OH I'd love to see a water-based comparison between one of these and a Cybertruck. Buick GL8 Buick GL8 Avenir. Suggested by: Midlux The latest version of the GL8 is called the Century, and it looks awesome. I love vans. Hongqi H9 The Hongqi H9, obviously. Once available only to high-ranking CCP and PLA members, it is at least as luxurious as a Rolls but looks much better IMO. Seeing 3 of them parked in front of the Beijing Shangri-La for an event was mind blowing. Suggested by: Guest The H9 is very cool, but it's not even close to the wildest car that Hongqi makes. Look at the Guoli!

Asia-Pacific leads via manufacturing scale, while policy-driven North America and sustainability-focused Europe grapple with supply chain resilience and circularity mandates. April 15, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global ultra-thin solar cells market was valued at US$ 34.56 million in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 167.95 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 21.85% during the forecast period 2025\u20132033. The ultra-thin solar cells market is driven by breakthroughs in photovoltaic efficiency and lightweight design. Consumer electronics, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and aerospace are key growth verticals, with companies prioritizing flexibility and energy density. For instance, 2024 has seen transparent solar windows integrate ultra-thin perovskite layers, achieving 15% efficiency while maintaining 80% transparency. Similarly, lightweight modules are being deployed in drone and satellite systems, reducing payload by up to 40% compared to traditional panels. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/ultra-thin-solar-cells-market Despite optimism, supply chain bottlenecks for indium tin oxide (ITO) and silver nanowires persist, elevating production costs by 12\u201315% in H1 2024. Manufacturers like Sunflare and Heliatek are pivoting to carbon-based electrodes and roll-to-roll printing to mitigate material scarcity. Policy tailwinds, including the EU\u2019s Solar Rooftop Initiative and India\u2019s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, are accelerating adoption. However, recycling challenges for end-of-life organic PV cells remain under-addressed, with less than 5% of materials currently recoverable. Stakeholders are now urging standardized recycling protocols to align with circular economic goals. Key Findings Ultra-Thin Solar Cells Market Market Forecast (2033) US$ 167.95 million CAGR 21.85% Largest Region (2024) Asia Pacific (35%) By Technology Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) (32%) By Application Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) (28%) By Installation On-grid (58%) By Substrate Glass Substrates (35%) Top Drivers Perovskite-silicon tandem efficiency breakthroughs enabling cost-competitive high-output energy. Flexible integration into BIPV, wearables, and solar-powered EVs. Government mandates and subsidies prioritizing lightweight renewable energy adoption. Top Trends AI-driven manufacturing optimizing ultra-thin cell defect detection rates. Recyclable material innovation addressing indium scarcity in conductive layers. Hybrid systems combining ultra-thin PV with solid-state storage Top Challenges Geopolitical semiconductor supply chain disruptions delaying critical component availability. Balancing cost-efficiency with stringent EU/US carbon footprint regulations. Scalability hurdles for perovskite durability in humid or high-temperature environments. Perovskite Innovations Dominate Ultra-Thin Solar Cells Market Efficiency Breakthroughs Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as the frontrunner in ultra-thin photovoltaic innovation, achieving record efficiencies of 33.7% in lab settings (NREL, April 2024). Companies like Oxford PV and Saule Technologies are scaling production of perovskite-silicon tandems, targeting commercial modules with 28% efficiency by Q4 2024. Stability improvements are also notable: encapsulated PSCs now withstand 1,200 hours of damp-heat testing (85\u00b0C, 85% humidity), addressing historical degradation concerns. Concurrently, Japan\u2019s Toshiba has commercialized 5-micron-thick CIGS cells for IoT devices, achieving 23.1% efficiency. Material science advances are reshaping manufacturing in the ultra-thin solar cells market. Laser scribing and vapor deposition techniques now enable micron-scale precision, cutting production waste by 20%. However, lead content in perovskites remains a regulatory hurdle, with the EU\u2019s RoHS 3.0 mandating sub-0.1% lead concentrations by 2026. Startups like Brightvolt are innovating lead-free tin-halide perovskites, though efficiencies lag at 18.2%. Meanwhile, MIT\u2019s 2024 study on self-healing polymers for PV encapsulation promises to extend module lifespans by 30%, potentially reducing LCOE (levelized cost of energy) by $0.02/kWh. These milestones underscore a pivotal shift from lab-scale curiosity to industrialized reality. Consumer Electronics Integrate Ultra-Thin Solar for Energy Autonomy The consumer electronics sector will account for 32% of ultra-thin solar cells market demand in 2024, per IDTechEx. Apple\u2019s 2024 smartwatch features a 2-micron photovoltaic layer, enabling 1-hour battery life extension daily under sunlight. Similarly, Xiaomi\u2019s solar-powered earphones and LG\u2019s energy-harvesting TV remote (launched at CES 2024) highlight mainstream adoption. Flexible solar films from Ascent Solar now power GPS trackers and military wearables, boasting 100,000 bend cycles without efficiency loss. Cost remains a barrier, with solar-integrated devices priced 6\u20138% higher than conventional counterparts. Yet, falling PV production costs\u2014down to $0.28/W for organic cells in 2024\u2014are narrowing this gap. Market education is critical: 62% of consumers in a 2024 Deloitte survey remain unaware of solar-powered gadget benefits. Brands like Garmin and JBL are launching awareness campaigns, emphasizing energy independence and carbon neutrality. As energy storage improves (see TDK\u2019s 2024 solid-state batteries), solar-charged electronics could displace 10% of lithium-ion demand by 2027. Government Policies and Venture Capital Propel Ultra-Thin Solar Cells Market Expansion Governments allocated $4.1 billion to ultra-thin solar R&D in 2024, with the U.S. DOE\u2019s \u201cSunshot 2030\u201d program funding 14 startups specializing in lightweight PV. The Chinese Ministry of Finance offers 30% tax rebates for BIPV installations using domestically produced thin-film modules, catalyzing a 42% YoY production surge. Similarly, Germany\u2019s \u201cSolarpaket II\u201d subsidizes solar-integrated facades at \u20ac0.08/kWh, driving a 200 MW order pipeline for Heliatek\u2019s organic PV films. VC investments reached $2.3 billion in H1 2024 in the global ultra-thin solar cells market, a 67% YoY increase, per PitchBook. Key deals include Nordic Solar\u2019s $400 million raise for nanostructured silicon PV and Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures backing Australia\u2019s SunDrive. However, investor focus is shifting from pure efficiency gains to sustainability metrics, with 73% of 2024 funding requiring ISO 14001 compliance. Regulatory risks loom, though, as the U.S. considers anti-dumping duties on Malaysian and Vietnamese thin-film imports, potentially disrupting 18% of global supply. Sustainability Challenges and Recycling Protocols for Ultra-Thin Solar Waste The ultra-thin solar cells market faces mounting pressure to address lifecycle sustainability, with 540,000 tons of PV waste anticipated by 2030, per the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA, 2024). Traditional silicon panel recycling methods are ill-suited for thin-film technologies, where layers of cadmium telluride (CdTe), perovskites, and organic polymers require delicate separation. In 2024, the EU\u2019s Circular Solar Alliance mandated that manufacturers achieve 70% material recovery rates by 2027, spurring R&D in chemical delamination. For instance, France\u2019s ROSI Solar patented a solvent-based process in Q2 2024 that recovers 92% of silver and 89% of indium from CIGS panels. Meanwhile, First Solar\u2019s $150 million Tennessee plant now recycles 90% of CdTe waste into new modules, slashing raw material costs by 18%.Despite progress, consumer education gaps persist. A 2024 Global Solar Council survey found 82% of installers lack training in handling end-of-life thin-film modules, risking toxic leakage. Startups like SolarCycle are partnering with Amazon and IKEA to pilot \u201ctake-back\u201d programs for solar-integrated products, offering discounts for returned items. However, cross-border regulatory disparities\u2014such as Asia\u2019s lax enforcement of lead containment in perovskite waste\u2014complicate global harmonization. Collaborative efforts like the WTO\u2019s Solar Waste Task Force (launched April 2024) aim to standardize protocols, but voluntary participation limits near-term impact. Stakeholders now advocate integrating blockchain for real-time material tracing across supply chains. Ultra-Thin Solar in BIPV Reshapes Urban Energy Landscapes Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) will command 28% of the ultra-thin solar cells market by 2024\u2019s end, driven by stringent urban decarbonization mandates. The EU\u2019s revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) requires all new public structures to incorporate solar fa\u00e7ades by 2026. Companies like Onyx Solar and Tesla are responding: Tesla\u2019s 2024 Solar Roof Tile V4, at 0.6mm thickness, delivers 25 W/ft\u00b2 while mimicking terracotta, slate, and glass. In Dubai, the Al Wasl Tower\u2019s 2024 retrofit deployed 14,000 m\u00b2 of Ubiquitous Energy\u2019s transparent solar windows, generating 1.2 GWh annually\u2014enough to power 300 homes.Architectural constraints remain a hurdle. Ultra-thin modules must balance aesthetics with structural load limits (<2.5 kg/m\u00b2), often necessitating bespoke engineering. Germany\u2019s Sunovation has partnered with Saint-Gobain to develop load-bearing solar glass with 17% efficiency, installed in Berlin\u2019s Merck HQ in the ultra-thin solar cells market. Yet, BIPV adoption in developing nations lags due to high upfront costs ($220\u2013$250/m\u00b2). India\u2019s PM-Surya Ghar Muft Bijli scheme counters this with 40% subsidies for residential BIPV, triggering 210,000 installations in Q1 2024 alone. Urban planners increasingly prioritize \u201csolar readiness\u201d in zoning codes, with Singapore\u2019s 2024 SolarMap mandating PV-ready rooftops for all buildings over 20m tall. Advanced Materials and Hybrid Systems Redefine Efficiency Limits Material innovations beyond perovskites are unlocking new frontiers. In May 2024, Swiss startup Insolight debuted a 35%-efficient microtracking solar film combining gallium arsenide (GaAs) and spectral-splitting optics. At 0.2mm thickness, it targets agrivoltaic systems, doubling crop yields via adjustable light filtering. Meanwhile, UCLA\u2019s 2024 study on 2D Janus monolayers\u2014using transition metal dichalcogenides\u2014achieved 31.5% photon-to-electron conversion under low-light conditions in the ultra-thin solar cells market, ideal for Nordic climates.Hybrid systems blending storage and generation are gaining traction. LG\u2019s 2024 \u201cSolar Skin\u201d integrates solid-state batteries within CIGS films, enabling 48 hours of off-grid operation at 15% efficiency. Such systems are critical for disaster response; Red Cross\u2019s 2024 pilot in Malawi deployed 5,000 solar tents with embedded storage, reducing diesel dependency by 70%. However, thermal management remains problematic, with GaAs layers hitting 85\u00b0C under peak load. Australia\u2019s SunDrive partnered with UNSW in June 2024 to embed graphene-based heat dissipation meshes, cutting operating temperatures by 22\u00b0C and boosting longevity by 8 years.

Kenya\u2019s 10 million off-grid households are adopting foldable perovskite solar sheets (e.g., Zola Electric\u2019s 40W \u201cGridless\u201d kit), priced at $0.11/W due to local manufacturing tax holidays. In India, Tata Power\u2019s 2024 partnership with CSIR launched a 20MW organic PV plant producing 0.3mm-thick modules for irrigation pumps, displacing 12,000 diesel units monthly.Microfinancing models are pivotal. Kenya\u2019s M-KOPA offers pay-as-you-go leases at $0.15/day, recovering costs within 18 months. Yet, 2024\u2019s 17% currency devaluation in Nigeria and Egypt has spiked import costs by 23%, stifling growth. Governments are countering via localization mandates; Angola\u2019s 2024 Solar Decree reserves 40% of public solar tenders for domestic thin-film producers. Asian Development Bank\u2019s $500 million \u201cUltra-Thin Solar Accelerator\u201d (April 2024) funds rural co-ops, prioritizing women-led installations. These strides underscore ultra-thin solar\u2019s role in bridging the global energy divide. Global Ultra-thin Solar Cells Market Key Players: First Solar, Inc. Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Ltd.

On Monday Bukele and Trump scoffed at the idea of sending him back, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return. Wait, so can they send citizens to El Salvador? Nothing like this has ever been contemplated in U.S. history, but it seems unlikely. There are other legal barriers besides the fact that you cannot deport U.S. citizens. The United States does have extradition treaties with several countries where it will send a citizen accused of a crime in that country to face trial there. That appears to be the only existing way a U.S. citizen can be forcibly removed from the country under current law. The Constitution also prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d and one of CECOT's selling points is that conditions there are far harsher than in prisons in the U.S. As noted above, federal courts have no jurisdiction there, and that may deprive people sent there of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. \"It is illegal to expatriate U.S. citizens for a crime,\" wrote Lauren-Brooke Eisen of the Brennan Center for Social Justice in New York. She noted that even if the administration tries to transfer federal prisoners there, arguing they're already incarcerated, it could run afoul of the First Step Act that Trump himself championed and signed in 2018. The provision requires that the government try to house federal inmates as close to their homes as possible so their families can visit them \u2014 and indeed transfer anyone housed farther than 500 miles from their home to a closer facility. One last loophole? There is one potential loophole that the administration could use to send a small group of citizens to El Salvador. They can try to strip the citizenship of people who earned it after immigrating to the United States. People who were made U.S. citizens after birth can lose that status for a handful of offenses, like funding terrorist organizations or lying on naturalization forms. They would then revert to green card holders, and would be potentially eligible for deportation if convicted of other, serious crimes. That's a small, but real, pool of people. Perhaps the most significant thing about it is that it would require loss of citizenship first. In other words, there's still likely no legal way to force a citizen out of the country.

(Arthur H. Trickett-Wile/The Grand Rapids Press via AP) By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com UPDATED: April 15, 2025 at 2:43 PM EDT By STEVE PEOPLES, AP National Politics Writer NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 As President Donald Trump pushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them. The Democrats\u2019 dominant national fundraising platform, ActBlue, and the party\u2019s largest protest group, Indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. Trump\u2019s top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution. Other Democratic allies are planning for Trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. Wary of antagonizing the Republican president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now. \u201cEvery one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the Trump administration. We are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves,\u201d said Ezra Reese, political law chair at Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by Marc Elias, the lawyer who has himself been a Trump target. FILE \u2013 Attorney Marc Elias stands on the plaza of the Supreme Court in Washington, March 21, 2016. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) An FBI spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into ActBlue and Indivisible. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether Trump wants the FBI, the Treasury Department or any other federal agency to investigate Democratic groups. \u201cAnyone who has not broken the law should not be worried,\u201d Leavitt told The Associated Press. \u201cIf you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key Republicans are embracing it. Trump\u2019s allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, one of which led to multiple felony convictions in New York. There\u2019s no evidence then-President Joe Biden influenced the Trump prosecutions in any way. Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, said Democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove. \u201cSomeone needs to get burned for all this activity or they\u2019re just gonna do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hypocrisy. That\u2019s justice.\u201d Trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries. During a norm-breaking speech at the Department of Justice last month, Trump cast himself as the country\u2019s \u201cchief law enforcement officer,\u201d a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general. On April 9, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor , a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. Trump said that Taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty. Musk calls Indivisible \u2018criminals\u2019 Indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the Democratic resistance since Trump returned to the White House. The group\u2019s leadership in Washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country. This year alone, Indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. The group was a key organizer in the recent Hands Off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Trump top adviser and billionaire Elon Musk has publicly condemned Indivisible as \u201ccriminals.\u201d The statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against Tesla dealerships and vehicles, which have spiked in recent weeks. Indivisible\u2019s leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside Tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property. No charges are known to have been filed against Indivisible or its leaders. But Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin says it\u2019s critical that Democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the Trump administration. His organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other Indivisible leaders face criminal charges. \u201cThey may try to come at us directly, or it\u2019s as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd that is a risk in a moment where you\u2019re facing anti-democratic threats like we are.\u201d \u201cOur choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they won\u2019t target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do that, what are you doing here?\u201d Democrats\u2019 fundraising at risk Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party\u2019s main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates. \u201cI think the FBI\u2019s going to do something on ActBlue soon,\u201d Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, said at a political event last month in Wisconsin.

Republican investigators have recently requested that ActBlue staffers testify behind closed doors in addition to providing a second batch of documents. Even before the congressional investigation concludes, multiple House Republicans have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into ActBlue. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has asked the Treasury Department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to \u201cterror-linked organizations.\u201d Separately, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to \u201cto skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws\u201d by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing. \u201cIt must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of American citizens,\u201d Biggs wrote. ActBlue said it is preparing for the possibility of many different attacks on various fronts, including investigations by the FBI or the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are relying on ActBlue to fund their campaigns as never before. Donors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the AP. The fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in ActBlue\u2019s two-decade history. While Republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, ActBlue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates that\u2019s funded by a 3.95% processing fee on each donation. \u201cThese unfounded attacks haven\u2019t shaken us \u2014 they\u2019ve sharpened our resolve to fuel Democratic wins,\u201d ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said. \u201cAs our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, Democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment.\u201d Originally Published: April 15, 2025 at 10:10 AM EDT Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Another brain tumor case reported amid Massachusetts nurse cluster Another brain tumor case reported amid Massachusetts nurse cluster Battenfeld: A \u2018special guest\u2019 appearance by Trump in Lexington and Concord would be historic Battenfeld: A \u2018special guest\u2019 appearance by Trump in Lexington and Concord would be historic Boston Police Department under fire as it faces contempt threat: \u2018Unthinkable\u2019 Boston Police Department under fire as it faces contempt threat: 'Unthinkable' Majority Leader John Thune\u2019s \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 approach to the Senate has kept Trump on board so far Majority Leader John Thune\u2019s \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 approach to the Senate has kept Trump on board so far Boston City Hall employee launches bid for mayor against Michelle Wu Boston City Hall employee launches bid for mayor against Michelle Wu Boston City Council split on how to fill Tania Fernandes Anderson\u2019s seat after plea leaves her district hanging Boston City Council split on how to fill Tania Fernandes Anderson's seat after plea leaves her district hanging Massachusetts parents \u2018livid\u2019 after schools give survey on sexual activity, gender identity to students who opted out Massachusetts parents 'livid' after schools give survey on sexual activity, gender identity to students who opted out Josh Kraft calls on Boston Mayor Michelle Wu to explain Fernandes Anderson special election \u2018double standard\u2019 Josh Kraft calls on Boston Mayor Michelle Wu to explain Fernandes Anderson special election 'double standard' Karen Read murder trial: Jury selection complete Karen Read murder trial: Jury selection complete Howie Carr: Your taxes prop up GBH, NPR, PBS agitprop Howie Carr: Your taxes prop up GBH, NPR, PBS agitprop More in National Politics 2025 April 15 Close", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "url": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/15/democrats-trump-administration-legal-threats/", "source": "Boston Herald", "published_at": "2025-04-15T14:10:40"}, {"id": 1802, "title": "Lucid Gravity First Drive: An electric SUV that doesn't make compromises | TechCrunch", "content": "Lucid Gravity First Drive: An electric SUV that doesn't make compromises | TechCrunch Lucid Gravity First Drive: An electric SUV that doesn't make compromises | TechCrunch Image Credits: Lucid Transportation Lucid Gravity First Drive: An electric SUV that doesn\u2019t make compromises The SUV version of the Lucid Air could become the quiet luxury pick for owners who need to haul seven passengers in an efficient, tech-laden EV. Abigail Bassett 6:30 AM PDT \u00b7 April 15, 2025 Lucid has spent years working on its second EV \u2014 a plush van-like SUV designed to be the category killer that could take market share from the likes of other luxury EV and internal combustion people haulers like the Rivian R1S, Cadillac Escalade IQ, BMW X7, and Audi Q8. The Saudi-backed company\u2019s aim was to create an SUV without compromise \u2014 a lofty goal other automakers have tried and failed at before. After a first drive in the EV, which has a starting price of $96,550, it\u2019s clear the company did more than just focus on luxurious touches. Although there are plenty. The Lucid Gravity may just be over-engineering at its best. The EV is loaded with tech and upgrades from its predecessor, the Lucid Air sedan. Peter Rawlinson, the former Lucid CEO and CTO, who stepped aside in February, may no longer be at the company, but his engineering fingerprints are all over the new Lucid Gravity. And while customers may never see the tech under the proverbial hood, they will experience it. The Lucid Gravity has up to 450 miles of EPA-rated range, a zero to 60 mph time under 3.5 seconds, and charging times that are unheard of for current EVs. The Gravity can charge up to 200 miles in just 11 minutes on DC fast charging, according to the company, thanks to a new boost mode that leverages the rear motor as a transformer to boost charging. All of this luxury, tech, and spaciousness do come with a price. The vehicle\u2019s price tag ranges between $96,550 for the two-row Grand Touring trim to $99,450 for the three-row version. A \u201ccheaper\u201d $81,550 Touring model is expected to arrive later this year. Lucid Gravity\u2019s tech guts Image Credits: Lucid Engineers working on Gravity took what they learned from Lucid Air Sapphire and the Lucid Air to create the company\u2019s new Gen 2 system that underpins the SUV. That includes a new battery developed in partnership with Panasonic (which Lucid says offers a 40% charging speed improvement over the competitive set), a new drive unit, a new thermal system, and a new charging system. Specifically, engineers created a system that allows the Lucid Gravity to charge at 225 kW on 500-volt architecture (which underpins Tesla\u2019s V3 chargers) chargers and at up to 400 kW on 1000-volt chargers (which underpins Tesla\u2019s new V4 chargers that are due to roll out this year). To do this, engineers used the Gravity\u2019s motor and inverter as a transformer to boost 500-volt charging to the battery\u2019s required voltage without adding extra hardware. They also implemented plug-and-charge for the system so that owners don\u2019t have to fuss with payment and charge initiation at certain chargers. EV charging innovation Image Credits: Lucid The changes are part of Tesla\u2019s North American Charging standard that came out last year. The announcement of the standard came at a time when the development of the Gravity was nearly complete. The updated standard required a significant rethinking of the underpinnings of the Gravity when it was roughly 70% developed in late 2022 and early 2023, according to Emad Dlala, the senior vice president of powertrain at Lucid. \u201cWhen I joined in 2015, 400-volt was state of the art,\u201d Dlala said. \u201cQuickly, we realized that we needed to take it to the next level,\u201d he continued, \u201cso we developed a new technology that enabled charging through a legacy 500-volt charging architecture through a future 1000-volt charging architecture. What we learned from Air in 2021 has been completely changed.\u201d The team behind Gravity also made a number of hardware changes to add in redundancy, support its infotainment system, and allow the company to eventually add more automated driving features to its advanced driver assistance system. The company is using Nvidia\u2019s Orin-X processors for AI perception and video processing for its advanced driver assistance system, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8295 for infotainment, and Infineon TC397 for vehicle dynamics and body control. Today, the Gravity offers what is known as Level 2 automated driving, a system that automates some of the driving, but still requires the driver to pay attention. Lucid is aiming to eventually offer Level 3, or L3, which typically offers hands-off, eyes-off driving on the highways in certain conditions. Its upcoming Dream Drive 2 Pro, an upgrade to its ADAS, is coming soon, according to the company, and will offer features like visualization of up to five lanes of traffic, curve speed control, lane change assistance, curb rash alert, and automated parking. Lucid Gravity: Cargo and passenger space Image Credits: Lucid The Gravity was designed to be spacious for occupants and their cargo. And engineers and designers achieved that goal. The interior is cavernous inside with a whopping 120 cubic feet of interior space, which Lucid says is 40% more than the closest competitor. It turns out an effort to avoid fuses helped them get there. The company wanted to find a way to not use fuses since they need to be regularly accessed and replaced when they blow, and they tend to take up precious interior space that could be used for cargo and passengers, according to Jean-Philippe Gauthier, the head of software engineering at Lucid. Instead, Lucid decided to use diffusers in the Gravity, which are essentially electronic switches. These diffusers reset automatically when the car is cycled off, respond faster to shorts in the system, eliminate the potential error of installing a fuse with the wrong amperage during replacement, and allow the fuse box to be buried deeper inside the vehicle instead of encroaching on interior space. Diffusers also can power down unneeded systems and reduce parasitic losses in the vehicle. To prove the Gravity was roomier than its competitors, the EV maker lined up a Cadillac Escalade IQ, Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, Rivian R1S, and BMW X7 on hand at an event in Los Olivos, California. Reporters were challenged to take boxes that filled the Gravity (including its spacious frunk) and stack them into the EQS SUV. It was an impossible task and with no other close competitor on hand. One fellow journalist who happens to be 6-foot, 6-inches was able to lie down in the rear of the Gravity comfortably and close the rear hatch without any issues. Lucid Gravity on the road Image Credits: Lucid The Gravity is big and measures a whopping 198.2 inches in length and 87.2 inches wide. That puts the EV SUV slightly below the Chevrolet Suburban in size. Still, the vehicle is massive, which helps boost the interior space. Typically, full-size SUVs with that kind of footprint tend to be boomy inside and giant rollie-pollies on the road, making them uncomfortable to hustle, especially on winding roads. Not so with the Lucid Gravity. I drove the Gravity from Nipomo, California on the Central Coast along Cuyama Highway and Tepusquet Road, a steep, one-lane, sharply winding road, to Los Olivos for my test drive and it was surprisingly enjoyable and, dare I say, fun to drive. The Gravity is heavy (6,000-plus pounds in the three-row option I drove). I did feel some of that weight on the road. However, once I placed the vehicle in its comfort setting known as \u201cSmooth,\u201d it handled highway cruising and wide sweepers with ease. I toggled it up to Swift for Tepusquet Road, and the adaptive dampers and air springs ate up the rough undulations and curves without unsettling the vehicle, or getting nauseatingly rolly at any point. It was so smooth on that winding road in the Swift setting that my passenger fell asleep. The Gravity gets rear-wheel steering when outfitted with the Dynamic Package (which adds around $,2900 to the base price), which gives you an additional 3-degrees of rear-wheel steering \u2014 both in phase and out of phase, depending on how quickly (or slowly) you\u2019re moving. That rear-wheel steer increases the agility of the vehicle and take up less of the road as it drives on single-lane mountain roads and even dirt track, which I did try out at a local ranch where Lucid set up a rally cross experience for us. Even when pushed (and sliding) through the dirt, the Gravity stayed remarkably flat and comfortable. And yes, you can do some very light off-roading with the Gravity as it gets 7-inches of ground clearance that can go up to 9-plus inches of clearance when raised. One of the surprising things that I liked the most about Gravity was the so-called \u201csquircal\u201d steering wheel. Having driven other vehicles with (dumb) yokes, the squared-off circle wheel makes the Gravity feel even more agile and responsive, and the electrically-assisted rack and pinion steering is adjusted to be absolutely spot on: where you point the wheel, the vehicle goes without any mushiness. Lucid also tuned one pedal drive to be so intuitive that I didn\u2019t have to touch the brake once on the winding roads around Los Olivos. All in, it\u2019s clear that after more than four years in development, the seven-passenger all-electric SUV delivers remarkable range and efficiency, agility, and functionality for a wealthy buyer looking for an \u201cAmerican-made\u201d vehicle that isn\u2019t a Tesla.

Share This Story More on what AOC is up to: Bernie and AOC Are Starting a New Political Movement Before Our Eyes Most Recent Post Attorney General Pam Bondi is ignoring the obvious illegality of President Donald Trump\u2019s outrageous request to exile U.S. citizens to foreign prisons. During an interview Monday night, Fox News host Jesse Watters asked the attorney general whether Trump\u2019s pitch to outsource the imprisonment of U.S. citizens was even legal. \u201cNow, the president was musing about sending some of the most horrible people in this country down to that megaprison, you know, people that push ladies into subways and hit old ladies with baseball bats to the head. Is that legal to do, is that something you\u2019re allowed to do?\u201d Watters asked. \u201cWell, Jesse, these are Americans who he is saying who have committed the most heinous crimes in our country, and crime is going to decrease dramatically because he has given us the directive to make America safe again,\u201d Bondi replied. \u201cThese people need to be locked up as long as they can, as long as the law allows, we\u2019re not gonna let \u2019em go anywhere. And if we have to build more prisons in our country, we will do it!\u201d Bondi\u2019s answer is lacking, well, an actual answer\u2014probably because deporting U.S. citizens is not legal. Trump\u2019s plan to exile Americans who are incarcerated to foreign countries not only violates multiple federal codes on the keeping of U.S. prisoners, it would also potentially violate the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Bondi\u2019s canned answer came just hours after Trump said during a press conference with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele that he had specifically asked her to look into the legality of sending U.S. citizens to El Salvador to be imprisoned. Trump made no mention of building additional prisons in the U.S., but said that the U.S. would be willing to financially support the construction of more prisons abroad. Clearly, Bondi is waging a political battle as much as a legal one, despite her promises that she would not act merely as an operative for Trump. Bondi must know that committing a \u201cmost heinous\u201d crime does not actually disqualify citizens from their legal rights\u2014but when faced with Trump\u2019s despotic plot, the attorney general declined to offer an answer in accordance with U.S. law.

Speaking to Fox News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Monday that \u201cthis illegal alien is exactly where he belongs, home in El Salvador,\u201d referring to Abrego Garcia\u2019s detention in El Salvador\u2019s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, a prison known for human rights abuses . \u201cHe was in our country illegally, he\u2019s from El Salvador, was born in El Salvador, and oh, the media forgot to mention, he is an MS-13 gang member,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe media would love for you to believe that this is a media darling, he\u2019s just some Maryland father.

In fact, an immigration judge ruled in 2019 that his life would be in danger if he were to return to El Salvador. In contrast, bin Laden co-founded Al Qaeda , responsible for several terrorist attacks around the world and thousands of deaths, including 2,996 people in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The fact that the Trump administration continues to lie and call Abrego Garcia a gang member and terrorist with no evidence to justify its defiance of a Supreme Court ruling to facilitate his return, is an egregious miscarriage of justice and slander of an innocent man. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record, is married to a U.S. citizen, and is the father of an autistic child. He deserves to return to the U.S., but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t want to admit that it\u2019s wrong.

They are now being held at the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a megaprison notorious for human rights abuses.

Share This Story More on this terrifying plan: Trump\u2019s Wildly Unconstitutional Plot to Banish U.S. Citizens to Gulags Most Recent Post An immigration attorney was surprised to receive a notice from the Department of Homeland Security instructing an immediate departure from the United States that was addressed to her\u2014not one of her clients\u2014especially considering the fact that she is a U.S. citizen. Nicole Micheroni received a notice, which appeared to be delivered by email from a Customs and Border Protection DHS account, alerting her that the \u201cDHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole.\u201d Micheroni, who was born in Newton, Massachusetts, is not in the United States on parole. \u201cIf you do not depart the country immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States,\u201d the notice warned. Micheroni told NBC10 Boston that \u201cat first I thought it was for a client, but I looked really closely and the only name on the email was mine.\u201d She noted that while the language was \u201cvery threatening\u201d and the email looked \u201ckind of like a sketchy spam email,\u201d it was the real thing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like an official government notice, but it is,\u201d she said. Micheroni told The Boston Globe that in the 12 years she\u2019d been an immigration attorney, she had never seen immigration parole terminated by email. Sarah Sherman-Stokes, associate director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights and Human Trafficking Clinic at Boston University, told the Globe that the DHS had recently put out a wave of parole termination notices via email, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to get immigrants to self-deport. In a statement to NBC10 Boston, the DHS said that \u201cCBP used the known email addresses of the alien to send notifications. If a non-personal email\u2014such as an American citizen contact\u2014was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients. CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.\u201d A senior DHS official said that it was possible that one of her clients had entered Micheroni\u2019s information by mistake. \u201cI think it\u2019s really scary this is going on,\u201d Micheroni said. \u201cI think it says they\u2019re not being careful.\u201d Micheroni\u2019s fears aren\u2019t unfounded: It\u2019s clear that the Trump administration is not being careful. The Trump administration is attempting to abandon a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month, due to an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d And on Monday, Donald Trump revealed that he\u2019d asked his attorney general to look into implementing his threat to banish U.S. citizens to foreign gulags\u2014which is entirely illegal . Share This Story Read more about Trump\u2019s plans: Trump Doubles Down on His Most Terrifying Threat Yet Most Recent Post Despite a court order, Donald Trump is still refusing to allow journalists from the Associated Press into the White House press pool. On Monday, the AP was barred from the White House to cover Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele\u2019s meeting with Trump, and issued a statement saying, \u201cOur journalists were blocked from the Oval Office today. We expect the White House to restore AP\u2019s participation in the pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order.\u201d Last week, a federal judge ruled that the president couldn\u2019t bar the AP from presidential events, saying, \u201cUnder the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists\u2014be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere\u2014it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints. The Constitution requires no less.\u201d Trump barred the AP in February from the Oval Office and Air Force One because the news agency refused to adopt Trump\u2019s unilateral name change of the Gulf of Mexico to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP responded by suing three administration officials on the grounds that the White House was violating the Constitution\u2019s free press protections by trying to dictate the AP\u2019s language. The president\u2019s refusal to allow the AP access to the White House on Monday escalates the matter further, as the organization would have to seek further redress in court. It\u2019s the latest example of Trump\u2019s attempts to intimidate and force media organizations to bend to his will, be it threatening legal action through the FCC or defamation lawsuits, or taking the unprecedented move of wresting control of the press pool away from the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. The administration is already defying larger court orders, such as those against its immigration practices , with nothing seemingly compelling it to follow the law, creating a constitutional crisis. This move against the AP is a direct assault on the First Amendment, and, barring any sort of penalty against the Trump administration, is a major blow to free speech and freedom of the press in America.

The letter came two weeks after three federal agencies announced a review of $9 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard. \u201cThe administration\u2019s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government\u2019s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge,\u201d Garber said in his statement. Harvard\u2019s audit is part of Trump\u2019s larger crackdown on postsecondary institutions and academic freedom, from funding cuts to deporting international students and banning DEI initiatives. A number of universities have crumbled under Trump\u2019s pressure, and fast. Columbia University unfairly expelled students involved in pro-Palestine protests and agreed to policy changes in an attempt to regain about $400 million in funding. Ohio State University closed its DEI programs, the University of Iowa eliminated housing specifically designated for Black students, Latinx students, and LGBTQ students, and the University of Pennsylvania has erased any reference to DEI or affirmative action from its websites. But the country\u2019s oldest postsecondary institution, which has long been criticized for its questionable endowment investments and lack of diversity , is refusing to crumble\u2014hopefully a catalyst for other universities to grow a spine and do the same.

Mahdawi was fearful of being deported, even before his friend, Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, was arrested last month by federal immigration agents. Mahdawi was included on a list of students the far-right pro-Israel organization Betar gave to the Trump administration in the hopes that they would be deported. Betar and the group Documenting Jew Hatred on Campus at ColumbiaU also posted on social media multiple times about Mahdawi, tagging law enforcement agencies on each post. After asking university officials to find him a safe place to live where he wouldn\u2019t be detained by ICE, and receiving no response, Mahdawi went into hiding before receiving an email notifying him of a citizenship interview at the UCSIS office earlier this month. Mahdawi worried that it was a trap, and contacted his elected representatives in Vermont: Representative Becca Balint and Senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch. All three promised to remain on standby pending Mahdawi\u2019s status after the interview, with Welch speaking to Mahdawi directly. In the end, it was a trap, and Mahdawi was detained with the same obscure immigration law used to detain Khalil and several other international students, including permanent residents: that their presence in the U.S. is a threat to the country\u2019s foreign policy interests. \u201cMohsen Mahdawi was unlawfully detained today for no reason other than his Palestinian identity,\u201d Mahdawi\u2019s attorney Luna Droubi told The Intercept. \u201cHe came to this country hoping to be free to speak out about the atrocities he has witnessed, only to be punished for such speech.\u201d It\u2019s particularly cruel to claim to offer citizenship to an immigrant, only to use it as a ruse to deport them over free speech issues. Mahdawi has not been charged with a crime, and pending his attorneys\u2019 habeas corpus petition , is now in ICE custody. For this administration, his crime appears to be being a Palestinian student who used his right to free speech. Share This Story More on Trump targeting international students over Palestine: State Department Memo on Abducted Tufts Student Exposes Rubio\u2019s Lies Most Recent Post Donald Trump plans to send as many people as he can to megaprisons in El Salvador. In a press conference with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele Monday, Trump was asked how many \u201cillegal criminals\u201d he plans to export to El Salvador. \u201cAs many as possible,\u201d the president responded. \u201cAs many as we can get out of our country that were allowed in here by incompetent Joe Biden, through open borders.\u2026 We have millions of people that should not be in this country that are dangerous.\u2026 We have millions of people that are murderers, drug dealers.\u201d But the majority of the more than 200 immigrants he\u2019s already sent to El Salvador were not murderers or drug dealers. They were ordinary people without criminal records, victim to the Trump administration\u2019s baseless lies about their pasts. Andry Hernandez Romero was a makeup artist who loved to do theater, Jerce Reyes Barrios was a soccer player whose innocent tattoo was flagged as a Tren de Aragua gang symbol by the Department of Homeland Security, Alirio Guillermo was a food delivery driver in Utah without a criminal record. They are now being held at the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a megaprison notorious for human rights abuses. Trump and Bukele\u2019s meeting comes as the White House claims it is not obligated to return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia after he was illegally deported to El Salvador, despite the Supreme Court ordering it facilitate his return. The Supreme Court also ruled that the government must give enough notice to immigrant detainees to dispute their deportation, but the Trump administration clearly doesn\u2019t care. On Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that another 10 migrants had been deported to El Salvador. Meanwhile, the president continues his threats to deport U.S. citizens to the megaprison. \u201cThe alliance between @POTUS and President @nayibbukele has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere,\u201d Rubio wrote in a post on X. It\u2019s a terrifying indication that the president plans to deport as many people as he can, and Bukele, who has jailed 1 percent of his own people, will happily do the same to anybody Trump sends his way. Share This Story More on Trump\u2019s threats: Trump\u2019s Wildly Unconstitutional Plot to Banish U.S. Citizens to Gulags Most Recent Post Donald Trump doubled down Monday on his unconstitutional threat to deport U.S. citizens to foreign gulags. During a press conference with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has already struck a $6 million deal to detain noncitizens the U.S. government alleges are gang members, Trump once again raised his desire to deport anyone, regardless of citizenship. \u201cI\u2019d like to go a step further, I mean, I say, I said it to Pam [Bondi]\u2014I don\u2019t know what the laws are, we always have to obey the laws\u2014but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies in the back of the head with a baseball bat when they\u2019re not looking, that are absolute monsters. I\u2019d like to include them in the group of people, to get \u2019em out of the country, but you\u2019ll have to be looking at the laws on that, Steph\u2014\u201d Trump said , referring to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who was standing just feet away. Is Trump\u2019s plot to exile U.S. citizens legal? Of course it isn\u2019t. \u201cNo law allows a federal court to sentence a defendant to serve their sentence overseas. Nor is there any statute that allows the president to unilaterally remove a U.S. citizen to another country at a whim,\u201d wrote Matt Ford for The New Republic Monday. But the Trump administration has confirmed that it is looking into the legality of the president\u2019s idea, a question that has apparently landed on the desk of his attorney general. While Trump has claimed that it would be cheaper to incarcerate individuals abroad, the president also asked Bukele to \u201cplease\u201d begin construction on new facilities and even offered to help foot the bill. \u201cI\u2019d do something; yeah we\u2019d help \u2019em out,\u201d Trump said . \u201cThey\u2019re great facilities, very strong facilities. They don\u2019t play games.\u201d During Trump\u2019s meeting with Bukele, the Salvadoran president balked at requests to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador\u2019s notorious prison, after the Supreme Court ordered that the Trump administration comply with a request to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return to the U.S. Miller chimed in with his own completely made-up story about the ruling and claimed that the high court had unanimously ruled in favor of Trump\u2014it hadn\u2019t, and there was no indication that the ruling was unanimous. The Supreme Court simply asked a lower court to clarify its order, \u201cwith due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\u201d In a filing Sunday, the Department of Justice argued that the federal courts could not compel the executive branch to conduct foreign affairs, and therefore any responsibility to help Abrego Garcia was limited to removing \u201cany domestic obstacles.\u201d Share This Story Read more about Trump\u2019s threat: Trump\u2019s Wildly Unconstitutional Plot to Banish U.S. Citizens to Gulags View More Posts Read More: Politics , Law , Supreme Court , Constitution , Foreign Policy , Health Care , Economic Inequality , Taxes , Washington", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "url": "https://newrepublic.com/post/194004/aoc-marjorie-taylor-greene-question-tariffs", "source": "The New Republic", "published_at": "2025-04-15T14:04:31"}, {"id": 1747, "title": "Donald Trump faces worst poll of second term: Americans say he\u2019s to blame for economic downturn, not Joe Biden, in stunning reversal", "content": "Americans blame Trump for economy: Donald Trump faces worst poll of second term: Americans say he\u2019s to blame for economic downturn, not Joe Biden, in stunning reversal - The Economic Times Benchmarks Nifty 23,328.55 500.0 FEATURED FUNDS \u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605\u2605 Canara Robeco ELSS Tax Saver Regular - Growth 5Y Return 21.85 % Invest Now FEATURED FUNDS \u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605\u2605 HSBC Large Cap Fund Direct-Growth 5Y Return 20.75 % Invest Now Enter search text: Business News \u203a News \u203a International \u203a US News \u203a Donald Trump faces worst poll of second term: Americans say he\u2019s to blame for economic downturn, not Joe Biden, in stunning reversal The Economic Times daily newspaper is available online now.

A new poll reveals a significant shift in public opinion, with disapproval of Trump's trade strategy rising sharply among independents and even some Republicans. Elon Musk, a Trump ally, is also facing increased unfavorable ratings. AP US president Donald Trump's support is suffering a serious blow as Americans increasingly blame him and not former president Joe Biden, for the nation's deteriorating economy, revealed a new poll. Donald Trump's Worst Poll In what's being called the \"worst poll\" of Trump's second term, 54% of voters now attribute the present economic turmoil to Trump, according to DailyBeast. That's a sharp turnaround from earlier in his term, when most held his predecessor responsible. Just 21% now blame Biden more. The figures are based on a new CNN report by political analyst and polling specialist Harry Enten, who dissected the numbers and claimed that, \"it looks like the American people are turning against Donald Trump,\u201d quoted DailyBeast. Enten highlighted that, \u201cDonald Trump may try to blame Joe Biden, and maybe that was working a month ago, but since the trade war began, it\u2019s not working anymore,\u201d as quoted in the report. He also added that, \u201cAmericans are not buying what Donald Trump is selling them,\u201d as quoted in the report. Majority of Americans Oppose Donald Trump\u2019s Trade Moves The poll indicated that 53% of Americans think the economy is worsening, increasing from 42% when Trump won the re-election, according to DailyBeast. The president's recent economic actions, especially his sudden and blanket tariff policies, seem to be backfiring with voters. Live Events Trump's trade policies are now under majority opposition, 58% of voters disapprove of his new tariffs, up from 46% in January, as per the report. Approval of his trade and tariff strategy has also plummeted, with 63% of Americans disapproving, that includes 72% of independents and even 12% of Republicans, reported DailyBeast. Enten said, \u201cHe\u2019s underwater for the first time,\u201d referencing his dismal approval rating, which has swung from +6 in February to -6 this week, as per the report. Cracks in the Republicans Base Even within his base, Trump's hold is weakening. Although 85% of the Republicans who voted for him in November remain his supporters, that figure is lower from the 91% he had prior to the tariff announcements, as per DailyBeast. His unpopularity among conservatives has also increased too, from 9% to 14%, as per the report. Elon Musk's Growing Unpopularity Trump is not the only public figure getting hammered. Billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is a close ally of Trump and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his popularity has also plummeted, according to the report. A recent YouGov poll found that 53% of Americans now see Musk unfavorably, up from 48% in January, as per DailyBeast. Pollster Adam Carlson said, \"Musk could serve as a powerful \u2018bonus bogeyman\u2019 for Democrats, particularly in tight races across the House, Senate, and state-level contests,\" quoted DailyMail. He went on to say, \u201cMusk is so electorally toxic that just the idea of him might be enough,\u201d as quoted in the report. FAQs Why are more Americans blaming Trump for the economy now? Recent tariff policies and ongoing economic uncertainty have shifted public opinion, with many believing Trump\u2019s decisions are doing more harm than good, as per poll results. How bad is Trump\u2019s approval rating right now? His approval has dropped from +6 in February to -6 this week, a pretty steep fall in just a few months.

The Justice Department has announced federal charges against five individuals in connection with vandalism against Tesla vehicles. The department charged Wagner on April 14 on two counts of property destruction by fire or explosives, each of which carries a prison sentence of five to 20 years. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wagner\u2019s arrest should be the \u201cfinal lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,\u201d and she told Fox News in an interview she directed prosecutors to not make a plea deal. \u201cHe is the fifth major arrest we\u2019ve made, and stay tuned for more,\u201d Bondi said. Bondi previously announced charges against three individuals suspected to have vandalized Tesla vehicles on March 20, relating to instances of vandalism in Loveland, Colorado, Salem, Oregon, and Charleston, South Carolina. The Justice Department announced on March 27 it had arrested and charged a fourth individual on one count of possession of an unregistered firearm and one count of arson, accusing the individual of using Molotov cocktails and an AR-style firearm to \u201cdamage and destroy five Tesla vehicles\u201d in Las Vegas. Did Trump Blame Billionaires Including Soros For The Tesla Attacks? In an interview with Newsmax host Greg Kelly, Kelly asked Trump: \u201cThe Tesla violence. Have you heard anything about billionaires on the left, whether it's Soros or somebody else? Have you heard anything about planning, coordination, funding for these attacks?\u201d In response, Trump said: \u201cI believe that that is part of it, yeah. There are some of them that were involved with my trials that were, I think, probably involved with that also,\u201d without providing evidence Soros or any other billionaires have been involved. Kelly\u2019s question echoes a theory Musk promoted on X earlier this month. Musk posted, citing an unnamed \u201cinvestigation\u201d and offering no further evidence, billionaires including George Soros and Reid Hoffman, as well as other Democratic-affiliated organizations, are \u201cresponsible for Tesla \u2018protests.\u2019\u201d Musk\u2019s post , despite containing no evidence, has been viewed more than 55 million times. What Has The Fbi Said About The Tesla Protests? The FBI said in a public service announcement instances of Tesla vandalism appear to have been conducted by \u201clone offenders,\u201d and that their tactics involve \u201clittle planning,\u201d such as \u201cimprovised incendiary devices and firearms.\u201d The announcement contrasts with Musk\u2019s claims \u2014which he made without evidence\u2014that billionaires including George Soros and Reid Hoffman, as well as ActBlue and other Democratic organizations, orchestrated the protests. The FBI\u2019s announcement described the attacks as involving \u201carson, gunfire, and vandalism, including graffiti expressing grievances against those the perpetrators perceive to be racists, fascists, or political opponents.\u201d The FBI\u2019s assistant director for public affairs, Ben Williamson, confirmed on X Monday the FBI created a task force to investigate and \u201ccrack down\u201d on attacks targeting Tesla. FBI Director Kash Patel also said Monday the FBI is actively investigating these incidents and established the task force to \u201ccrack down and coordinate our response,\u201d labeling the attacks \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Dan Bongino, the FBI\u2019s deputy director, said in a post on X last week he is \u201cactively working on the Tesla incidents\u201d in one of his first official posts in office. Spencer Evans, who leads the FBI\u2019s Las Vegas field office, said at a press conference last week the FBI is investigating the incident that targeted a Las Vegas facility and left five vehicles damaged earlier this week. \u201cTo those who might think that something like this is justifiable or potentially even admirable, we want you to know this is a federal crime,\u201d Evans said. Did Trump Say Tesla Vandals Should Be Jailed In El Salvador? In a Truth Social post , Trump said \u201csick terrorist thugs\u201d who have vandalized Tesla vehicles should serve 20-year sentences, suggesting: \u201cPerhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\u201d Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, accepted hundreds of migrants deported from the United States last week, and transferred them to the country\u2019s infamous Terrorism Confinement Center. The prison, among others in El Salvador, has been accused of human rights abuses by organizations including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as incarceration has dramatically increased under Bukele\u2019s presidency. What Has The Justice Department Said About The Tesla Protests? In a statement on March 20 announcing charges against three individuals, Bondi said, \u201cLet this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\u201d In a previous statement Tuesday, Bondi said the instances of vandalism are \u201cnothing short of domestic terrorism\u201d and said the Justice Department has already charged several demonstrators, some of whom face mandatory five-year sentences. Bondi threatened \u201csevere consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\u201d Bondi previously said in a Fox Business interview Friday morning she has directed an investigation be opened into the Tesla protests to prosecute perpetrators and to find anyone who may be funding these protests. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\u201d Bondi said. Are Tesla Owners Trading In Their Cars? Tesla owners are trading in their vehicles in record numbers, according to data from car shopping website Edmunds. Edmunds said March has had \u201cthe highest ever share\u201d of Tesla trade-ins, CNBC reported . How Has Musk Responded To The Tesla Protests? Musk told Fox News \u2019 Sean Hannity he believes there are \u201clarger forces at work\u201d that are \u201cfunding\u201d and \u201ccoordinating\u201d the Tesla protests, echoing earlier unfounded claims he made blaming billionaires and Democratic-affiliated organizations for the vandalism. In a post Tuesday on X, Musk slammed the Tesla vehicles being set on fire in Las Vegas as \u201cterrorism.\u201d He said the \u201clevel of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d adding Tesla \u201cjust makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d Musk dubiously pointed fingers at various billionaires, including George Soros and Reid Hoffman, though he hasn\u2019t provided evidence to back up his claims that they\u2019re behind the protests. In a post on X last week, he claimed an \u201cinvestigation\u201d\u2014without naming a specific investigation\u2014found Soros, Hoffman, the ActBlue Democratic fundraising conduit and various left-wing groups to be responsible for the protests. He also posted a \u201cheartfelt thanks to everyone supporting @Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices.\u201d Did Trump Say Tesla Vandals Should Be Considered Domestic Terrorists? Yes. During a demonstration at the White House, in which five Tesla vehicles were lined up with Musk in attendance, right-wing Real America\u2019s Voice reporter Brian Glenn suggested to Trump that \u201csome say they should be labeled domestic terrorists.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cI will do that. I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m going to stop them,\u201d adding, \u201cYou do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell.\u201d Glenn has tweeted critically of the Tesla protests, urging the government to \u201cshut it down immediately\u201d in a post on X , which he made in response to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who posted a letter she and other representatives sent to the Department of Justice and FBI urging them to prosecute Tesla vandals for domestic terrorism. A day prior to Trump\u2019s Tesla demonstration, he said on Truth Social he would purchase a Tesla as a show of support for Musk, slamming the \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d for protesting the car company, which Trump claimed is \u201cillegal.\u201d Could Tesla Vandals Be Prosecuted As Domestic Terrorists? There is no federal charge for domestic terrorism, so individuals suspected to have committed acts of domestic terrorism must instead be charged with other crimes. The United States federal criminal code defines domestic terrorism as \u201cacts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State\u201d that are intended to coerce either the civilian population or government policy, or to impact the government through \u201cmass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.\u201d Surprising Fact Twelve Tesla vehicles were set on fire in Toulouse, France , on March 2 in an incident prosecutors say was \u201cnot at all accidental.\u201d A Tesla factory near Berlin was set on fire March 5, causing a power outage. A far-left group, Volcano Group, claimed responsibility for the apparent arson in Berlin. What Is \u201ctesla Takedown?\u201d Some peaceful protests against Tesla dealerships in cities across the United States have been linked to \u201c Tesla Takedown ,\u201d an organization that urges people to \u201csell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines,\u201d according to its website. Actor Alex Winter is a key figure behind the protests, which he began organizing in February. He posted on BlueSky on Tuesday that Tesla Takedown is a \u201cpeaceful, grassroots protest movement formed by many thousands of concerned citizens,\u201d hitting back at Trump\u2019s claim the Tesla protests are \u201cillegal.\u201d Tangent Musk has held onto the reins of his various companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), while working as the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s leader\u2014but Musk told Fox Business on Monday he is juggling his business and political ventures \u201cwith great difficulty.\u201d Further Reading Trump Gets Behind The Wheel Of A Tesla To Support Elon Musk As Company Stock Falls (Forbes) Elon Musk Dubiously Blames Billionaires George Soros, Reid Hoffman Over Tesla Protests\u2014Citing Unnamed \u2018Investigation\u2019 (Forbes) Conor Murray Following Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades Join The Conversation Comments One Community.

Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images To say it\u2019s been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) , Nvidia (NVDA) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , Amazon (AMZN) , Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump \u2019s volatile tariff announcements.

See all of our newsletters The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect\u2014causing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days\u2014except for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad , some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, r elies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here\u2019s a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple: down 10 percent since April 2 Apple\u2019s hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker\u2019s share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump\u2019s 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Microsoft: up 1.6 percent since April 2 Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump\u2019s initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president\u2019s temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia: up 1.8 percent since April 2 Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon: down 8 percent since April 2 Amazon\u2019s shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump\u2019s tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn\u2019t completely reliant on e-commerce\u2014its cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company\u2019s profits and won\u2019t be as impacted by the administration\u2019s levies as Amazon\u2019s physical goods business. Meta: down 9 percent since April 2 Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn\u2019t spare its stock from a steep drop\u2014down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump\u2019s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company\u2019s core business\u2014selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands\u2014stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets . Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta\u2019s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Alphabet: up 1 percent since April 2 Like Meta, the Google parent company\u2019s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after \u201cLiberation Day\u201d and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla: down 12 percent since April 2 Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn\u2019t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration\u2019s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn\u2019t as lucky with car parts\u2014 30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk \u2019s controversial role as head of the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Starlink can provides internet for remote tracking of animals. Tesla Energy can powers conservation outposts. Neuralink has potential for wildlife brain monitoring. The Boring Company can create safe animal corridors. xAI can analyse wildlife data. SpaceX supports Earth-observing missions. These technologies can aid in protecting animals like elephants, tigers, and snow leopards. Once hailed as a \u201csuper climate pro\u201d by none other than himself, Elon Musk now aligns with Donald Trump, who is not particularly known for prioritising environmental or climate issues. Concern over the climate crisis is seemingly no longer one of Musk's priorities. However, changes of heart and shifts in perspective can happen at any time. Whether Musk returns to his earlier environmental stance or not is entirely his decision. In the meantime, we are here to highlight how his technologies can still be harnessed to conserve endangered species and protect forests around the world. Can Elon Musk\u2019s technologies help protect our planet\u2019s rarest animals 1. Starlink (by SpaceX) \u2013 Satellite internet How it helps : Provides high-speed internet in remote areas where most endangered species live. Applications: Real-time tracking of animals like elephants, snow leopards, and rhinos using GPS collars connected via Starlink. Remote monitoring of poaching hotspots in places like African savannas or Amazon rainforests. Connecting conservationists in isolated field stations to global research hubs 2. Tesla Energy \u2013 Solar + battery solutions (powerwall, solar roof) How it helps : Offers off-grid power solutions, essential for remote conservation outposts and field labs. Applications: Powering camera traps and research stations in reserves like Kaziranga (for rhinos) or Sundarbans (for tigers). Recharging drones used for aerial surveillance of protected areas. 3. Neuralink (brain-computer interface) \u2013 Experimental use How it Might help (Future Potential) : Though still in early human trials, similar neural technologies can be developed for wildlife. Applications: Could help understand neural patterns and stress behaviours in captive or rehabilitated primates like orangutans or gorillas. Might enable non-invasive brain monitoring for endangered dolphins, elephants, etc., in the long term. 4. The Boring Company \u2013 Tunneling for human-wildlife conflict reduction How it helps : Could be used to create safe animal corridors beneath roads and railways, especially in areas with high mortality due to vehicle collisions.Applications: Wildlife underpasses for leopards and tigers in India\u2019s Western Ghats or Terai Arc. Safe crossings for bears or wolves in North America or Europe. 5. xAI \u2013 AI for monitoring How it helps : AI can analyze patterns in wildlife movement, climate data, and poaching activity. Applications: Identifying poaching risks using predictive models for tiger conservation. Analyzing drone footage or camera trap images to track animal populations like snow leopards in the Himalayas. 6. SpaceX Rockets (indirect role) How it helps : Satellite launches can support Earth-observing missions. Applications: Satellites launched via Falcon 9 could support deforestation tracking in the Amazon (habitat for endangered parrots and jaguars). Monitoring glacial melt in polar habitats (for species like polar bears and penguins).

Meta will start training its AI models using public data from adults in the EU, after pausing the plan last year over data protection concerns raised by Irish regulators. In June 2024, the social media giant announced it was delaying the training of its large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram following the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) request . Meta was disappointed by the DPC request, the company pointed out that this is a step \u201cbackwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), our lead regulator, on behalf of the European DPAs, to delay training our large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European DPAs have been informed since March.\u201d said Meta in a statement . \u201cThis is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe.\u201d The company explained that its AI, including Llama LLM, is already available in other parts of the world. Meta explained that to provide a better service to its European communities, it needs to train the models on relevant information that reflects the diverse languages, geography and cultural references of the people in Europe. For this reason, the company initially planned to train its large language models using the content that its European users in the EU have publicly stated on its products and services. Meta now confirmed it is going to resume training its AI models with public data from EU individuals. \u201cIn the EU, we will soon begin training our AI models on the interactions that people have with AI at Meta, as well as public content shared by adults on Meta Products.\u201d reads a post published by the company. \u201cThis training will better support millions of people and businesses in Europe, by teaching our generative AI models to better understand and reflect their cultures, languages and history.\u201d The company pointed out that users based in the EU can choose to object to their public data being used for training purposes. Starting this week, EU users will get notices about their data being used to improve AI, with an option to easily object at any time. Meta remarked that they do not use people\u2019s private messages with friends and family to train their generative AI models. It also added that public data from the accounts of people in the EU under the age of 18 is not being used for training purposes. \u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to build AI that\u2019s not just available to Europeans, but is actually built for them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for our generative AI models to be trained on a variety of data so they can understand the incredible and diverse nuances and complexities that make up European communities.\u201d concludes the post. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the kind of AI training we\u2019re doing is not unique to Meta, nor will it be unique to Europe. This is how we have been training our generative AI models for other regions since launch. We\u2019re following the example set by others including Google and OpenAI, both of which have already used data from European users to train their AI models. We\u2019re proud that our approach is more transparent than many of our industry counterparts.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, artificial intelligence) facebook linkedin twitter AI Artificial Intelligence Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security Meta Pierluigi Paganini privacy Security Affairs Security News you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 16, 2025 Chinese Android phones shipped with malware-laced WhatsApp, Telegram apps Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 16, 2025 Cyber Threats Against Energy Sector Surge as Global Tensions Mount Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Cyber Threats Against Energy Sector Surge as Global Tensions Mount Hacking / April 16, 2025 Government contractor Conduent disclosed a data breach Data Breach / April 16, 2025 Critical Apache Roller flaw allows to retain unauthorized access even after a password change Security / April 15, 2025 Meta will use public EU user data to train its AI models Digital ID / April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Josh Shapiro (D) by stating that while we don\u2019t know the exact motives of the attacker, \u201cThe people that ratcheted the temperature up, the folks that should have been the loudest here\u201d are in the Oval Office and after the attempted assassination of then-candidate Donald Trump \u201cyou had Democrats bending over backwards to say, we have to take the temperature down, we have to bring the temperature down, when they weren\u2019t even the people that ratcheted the temperature up.\u201d Sanders said, \u201c[W]e don\u2019t know, we have to let the investigation play out, but obviously, the Seder, the Passover Seder happened earlier that evening, and then, hours later, this man attempted to enter the Governor\u2019s home and set fire to it. We don\u2019t know if he had motivations that had to do with the fact that the Governor was Jewish, but an investigation will vet that out. But what we do know is this is a long line in a string of political attacks. And I remember very vividly when President Trump was \u2014 the attempted shooting against him, and all the Democrats and Republicans spoke out, and you had Democrats bending over backwards to say, we have to take the temperature down, we have to bring the temperature down, when they weren\u2019t even the people that ratcheted the temperature up.\u201d (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

(Getty Images/DogoraSun) Officials in three California cities are trying to work out how voices mocking President Trump, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg were added to crosswalks. The crosswalks appear to have been hacked with the sole purpose of mocking the billionaires with AI-generated voices, per Business Insider . The audio message, \"Walk sign is on,\" is usually broadcast from crosswalks to assist people who are visually impaired. But residents in Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City, instead heard AI-generated voices of Meta CEO Zuckerberg boasting of \"undermining democracy\" and \"making the world less safe for trans people\"; Tesla CEO Musk cursing and complaining that he has no friends; and Trump telling Musk , \"Sweetie, come back to bed.\" In clips shared on social media, a Musk-esque voice says , \"People keep saying cancer is bad, but have you ever tried being a cancer? It's f---ing awesome.\" A voice like Zuckerberg's says , \"It's normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcefully insert AI into every, every facet of your conscious experience. And I just want to assure you, you don't need to worry, because there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. Anyway, see ya.\" \"It's very cool protest art,\" one witness tells KTVU . \"I have no idea how they did it.\" A Palo Alto city employee noticed the issue at one crosswalk on Saturday before officials discovered another 12 were affected, per BI. A city rep said the crosswalks' voice announcement feature was temporarily disabled in response to an apparent hack on Friday. As of Saturday evening, officials in Redwood City were also aware of odd audio messages coming from the city's crosswalks, with deputy city manager Jennifer Yamaguma noting staff were \"actively working to investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\" Redwood City is home to Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, while Palo Alto hosts global engineering and AI offices for Tesla. Menlo Park is home to Meta headquarters. It's a fairly mild inconvenience for the cities, which will now know to install anti-infiltration devices on crosswalk systems, a retired FBI agent tells CBS News . (More California stories.)

More disagreement\u2014about what comes next. Getty Images Fissures are emerging in the disparate team of loyalists President Donald Trump has assembled to help him execute the agenda for his new term. The personality clash between Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, two of Trump\u2019s key allies, is making headlines \u2014and bears watching. Their ideological differences will shape the debate on the administration\u2019s top priority: taxes. The architect of Trump\u2019s first campaign and at times a formal advisor, Bannon has drifted in and out of the president\u2019s orbit over the years. But he remains the foremost voice of the populist wing of Trump\u2019s coalition. Musk, after pouring billions of dollars into Trump\u2019s election, now attends cabinet meetings and oversees the Department of Government Efficiency. With Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from 2017 set to expire this year, both are now speaking out in advance of what is shaping up to be a massive fight over taxes. And they have very different ideas of what our tax system should look like. The stakes are high, and the outcome of this debate will shape our country\u2019s sources of revenue and ability to invest in key priorities for the next decade and beyond. Some of the ideas being discussed are worthy of consideration and discussion. But a few of the suggested changes to our tax system would be problematic and perhaps even disastrous for the country\u2014and especially for American workers. Bannon has called for a \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthy, Semafor reported in December. Musk, who claims to be determined \u201cto close tax loopholes,\u201d has adopted the persona of an antigovernment crusader. This divide has exposed what appears to be a growing\u2014and possibly unbridgeable\u2014gap in the MAGA coalition.

Musk\u2019s leadership of DOGE is perceived by many as advancing the interests of Silicon Valley business leaders to the detriment of America\u2019s businesses and markets. Musk has advocated (on social media platform X, which he owns) for a \u201cdrastic simplification\u201d of the tax code to \u201cincrease productivity\u201d instead of \"incentivizing bizarre tax-avoidance behavior.\u201d But the U.S. tax code is too complicated, with countless loopholes the wealthy use to their own advantage. When Musk spoke last year about investors pitching him on exploiting tax loopholes (because \u201clots of other people are getting away with it\u201d), many wealthy investors and people in the business community nodded\u2014lots of people have heard similar things. But Musk arguably is not making a good-faith argument. Just last year, his company, Tesla, paid $0 in federal income tax , the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy noted. And SpaceX and other Musk companies have received around $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits over the past two decades, according to The Washington Post . Musk has also trumpeted a flat tax that would replace the current seven federal tax brackets. That would result in a tax code stacked against working families and could end certain deductions and credits that benefit middle-class families, including the ability to deduct mortgage interest, student loan interest, and high medical costs. What Bannon Wants In sharp contrast to Musk, populist firebrand Bannon spoke about economic, industrial, and national security policies that \u201cmake the citizen the actual focus of the government,\u201d with a focus on \u201cdriving the benefits to working people, to the middle class.\" On his podcast, Bannon\u2019s War Room, he has called for \u201cmassive\u201d tax increases on billionaires, arguing that \u201cThey made this mess ... why shouldn\u2019t they pay for it?\" Bannon appears to be aiming squarely at Musk\u2019s own Big Tech crowd. He has reportedly called them out for being too powerful and concentrated and derides them as rent-seekers who made their money from venture capitalists who redistributed wealth upward by raiding Americans\u2019 pension funds. While some of Bannon\u2019s views have merit, it\u2019s hard to see how they can be reconciled with Musk\u2019s pro-billionaire views. What Trump And The GOP Want: Extending TCJA So, what does Trump want? The Project 2025 playbook provided a road map: reductions to corporate, marginal, and capital gains tax rates; pulling the U.S. out of global agreements that ensure corporations and wealthy individuals pay minimum taxes; and slashing the IRS budget and staff (which has already been done). It all depends on what the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress choose to pass. The House recently approved a budget that sets a limit on the size of tax cuts but failed to note which taxes should be reduced. That could take months to sort out. With a minuscule congressional majority, the House GOP seems less focused on Musk\u2019s simplification approach or Bannon\u2019s reimagining of industrial policy than simply extending the TCJA. That signature economic move of Trump\u2019s first term in office gave $700 billion to foreign investors with little-to-no loyalty to America. As I wrote last year , extending the law means renewing a \u201cpass-through\u201d provision that is 50 times more likely to help the top 1% of earners, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , and cost an estimated $3.8 trillion, including interest, through 2033. And, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, it would add $11 trillion to the debt over the next decade with little-to-no increased economic activity to show for it. Here again the Republican coalition is showing cracks as it scrambles to find cuts to pay for Trump\u2019s tax cuts. Reuters reported on how one faction hopes to avoid growing the nation\u2019s more than $36 trillion debt while the other worries that steep cuts to Medicaid will impact working families struggling with high health care costs. With more than 20 million Republicans reportedly on Medicaid, according to KFF, Bannon has laid these cuts out as a disaster for Trump. As Bannon has said on his podcast: \u201cIf the ox has got to get gored, it\u2019s got to come out of the wealthy.\u2026 It cannot come out of the middle class.\u201d The public seems to agree. Headlines have focused on the economic impact of order detentions, punitive tariffs on foreign goods and the antagonism of longtime allies\u2014the so-called \u201cTrump Slump.\u201d But, according to research by the Global Strategy Group , four out of five Americans, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, support raising taxes on the ultrarich instead of working families. So, will Trump once again follow his billionaire friends and mega-cap corporations like Tesla? Or will he follow the cue of Bannon and his supporters in the GOP House to finally pass a tax code that rewards\u2014rather than penalizes\u2014American small businesses and working families? The clock is ticking\u2014not only on the Trump tax cuts, which expire on December 31, but on delivering change to voters. For the moment, it looks like Musk\u2019s donor billionaire class is winning. But Bannon has warned the president and Republicans in Congress that if you don\u2019t \u201cbreak that mindset that stock buybacks are fine, that crony capitalism is fine, and the tax breaks for the corporations are fine, then you\u2019re going to squander a unique moment in history.\u201d It's a warning they can't afford to ignore.

The company said it could do just about anything and everything you throw at it. I usually take stuff like that with a grain of salt, but after driving the 2025 Lucid Gravity Grand Touring , I'm convinced there are dozens of cars that are now rendered pointless. Yes, it really is that good. No matter what I asked it to do, the Gravity answered the call and then some. There are very few tasks that the Gravity cannot handle. Lucid hasn't had the most financial stability in the industry over the past few years. It hit a real home run with the Air when it came out for the 2022 model year, but it took a while for sales to hit meaningful numbers, and even then a large luxury sedan is a hard sell. We're living in an SUV-loving world, so Lucid's second act, the Gravity , needed to be excellent if it wants to compete in an extremely important part of the market. Luckily for Lucid \u2014 and the people who put down deposits for the Gravity \u2014 this new SUV is even better than advertised, and it leaves you wondering why other cars can't be like it. Full Disclosure : Lucid flew me out to Southern California, fed me and put me up in a very nice hotel all so I could drive the 2025 Gravity. The power of Gravity Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik There are tons of reasons why the Gravity Grand Touring is so impressive, and I'll get into them all shortly, but the most standout thing about this nearly 6,000-pound, seven-seat electric crossover is the way it drives. Lucid says its goal with the Gravity was to create a \"seven seat supercar,\" and while that's a bit of hyperbole, it's not a claim that is completely without merit. For now the Gravity only comes in Grand Touring trim, which has two quite compact yet audibly noticeable electric motors mounted on the front and rear axles. Combined, the whole drive unit puts out an extremely healthy 828 horsepower and 909 pound-feet of torque. It's enough juice to get the Gravity from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, and it feels every bit as quick as that. Despite its size, the big Lucid still gives you that pinned-to-your-seat feeling that you get with so many EVs these days. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Still, the range is quite good \u2014 nearly class-leading, in fact, just 10 miles behind the Cadillac Escalade IQ . Energy is stored in a 123-kWh battery, which gives the Gravity Grand Touring a 450-mile range. That for sure will get you where you need to go, and even if you run low on power, charging is a cinch. The Gravity is fitted with a NACS charge port , so you can plug it in at any Tesla Supercharger, but it can charge even faster than those currently allow thanks to a 900-volt architecture. Lucid says the Gravity can juice up at 350 kW, so you'll be able to add 200 miles of range in just 11 minutes, which is faster than just about everything west of China. Lucid wanted to build a car you could use on a family road trip with confidence, and it certainly achieved that. Between its wonderfully comfortable air suspension (a first for Lucid), excellent advanced driver-assist systems, airy cabin and long range, you can eat up miles rather quickly in a Gravity. It's a very similar vibe to the Air's ability to be a GT car, and that's no coincidence. Driving the seven-seat supercar Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik But, what about when you're not on a road trip? What about when you find yourself on a twisty fun road with no one in front of you? Well, the Gravity excels there, too. Lucid's engineers did a great job creating a real split personality for this crossover. In the Smooth drive mode the Gravity is very chill and relaxed; bump up to Swift and everything gets a bit tighter. For the real fun head over to Sprint mode, which stiffens up the chassis, adds weight to the steering and sharpens throttle response, among a million other tiny adjustments. In Sprint the Gravity is genuinely fun to huck down a back road \u2014 or a dirt trail, if you get the chance. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik There's a ton of grip from the optional 21-inch front and 22-inch rear tires \u2014 yes, the Gravity has staggered-size front and rear wheels , how cool is that? (There's also an available 22-inch front and 23-inch rear setup, or 20s in front and 21s in the rear.) Body roll is pretty well managed, but it's certainly still noticeable. You can only do so much to mask 6,000 pounds worth of car. What the Gravity does really well is dig itself out of a corner; it's a real point-and-shoot machine. The rear-wheel steering system is also a real highlight, and another first for Lucid. It can either turn with or against the front wheels to give it either a longer or shorter-feeling wheelbase, increasing agility in corners and aiding stability at high speeds. It also gives the 198.2-inch Gravity a turning radius of just 38 feet, which is seriously impressive from a car this big. The Gravity can also haul itself in rather nicely thanks to its huge brakes. Six-piston calipers with 15.4-inch rotors are up front, and four-piston calipers with 15.3-inch discs are in the rear. If that isn't quite enough for you, there's also adjustable regenerative braking, which can go all the way from completely turned off to full one-pedal driving that'll slow the car down at a rate of 0.33 Gs. Not too shabby. Going where no Lucid has gone before Lucid It's also not too shabby off-road. All Gravitys come with height-adjustable air suspension that can be raised all the way up to give you 9.3 inches of ground clearance. That's enough to handle just about every muddy, rutted path you can throw at it. There's also an off-road Terrain mode that lets you have a hell of a lot of fun on a loose surface (depending on how much you disable the safety nannies). Much like its on-road characteristics, the Gravity likes to rotate when you lift off the throttle while regen braking is engaged. It's extremely progressive, though \u2014 you're never caught off guard by it, and you get the hang of it fairly quickly. You'll soon find yourself transitioning from corner to corner with the tail out, feeling like a hero. I don't know many other heavy-ass SUVs that can do that. A nice place to be Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Regardless of how you're driving the Gravity Grand Touring, you'll be thrilled to be spending time in its interior. The list of vehicles on sale today with a cockpit this lovely is exceedingly short, and none of them cost as little as the Gravity does. No matter where you look you'll find wonderful-feeling leathers, bright metal pieces, open-pore woods and really interesting fabric and canvas materials. The car I drove was fitted with Lucid's extremely soothing Yosemite color combination, which gave the Gravity a super airy feeling along with the massive windshield in front of you and the overall layout of the cabin's controls. In a world where a lot of car interiors feel interchangeable between brands, the Gravity sets itself apart as something that is not of this world. It's certainly a place that is meant to make you feel calm and help you unwind. Lucid says it's inspired by mid-century modern furniture , and that shows through. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Adding to this serenity is the way the two main screens operate. The Gravity is undoubtedly a very tech-forward vehicle, but the way Lucid has implemented the technology throughout its cabin is really something. The Gravity, similarly to the Air, has two screens for front passengers. A curved 34-inch 6K display looks rather lovely and serves as your gauge cluster and infotainment screen; the right side is operated via touch. Below that is a 12.6-inch touchscreen that lets you control much of the Gravity's functions. Both are integrated rather well and customizable enough that you can put whatever information you want wherever you want it. If that's not your style, you can always hook up Apple CarPlay (Android Auto is apparently coming soon) and let that do the work for you. The gauge cluster section is left mostly clutter-free with just a speedometer and a regen braking meter viewable. If you activate Lucid's brilliant DreamDrive 2 Pro Level 2 driver-assist system, you get a rendering of all of the vehicles around you in that open gauge screen space. Right now Gravitys don't have it, but over-the-air updates adding full hands-free highway driving and automatic lane changes are said to be coming. Even further down the road, Lucid engineers tell me we'll see a Level 3 hands-free driving system in the Gravity. The hardware is apparently already there, it just needs to be switched on. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Everything just works super well in this car, and it made driving through the tight roads of the Ojai Valley in California that much more enjoyable \u2014 even if the squircle steering wheel took a bit of getting used to, especially in hand-over-hand maneuvers. Designers tell me the shape of the wheel was a real back and forth internally at Lucid, but they ultimately went with it because ths shape doesn't block the gauge cluster in the same way a regular steering wheel would. I get it, and you'll get used to it. It's not nearly as bad as Tesla's yoke, so don't worry. What a package Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik The Gravity's other real party trick is its interior space and packaging. It's not too surprising, as this is an area Lucid excelled in with the Air. You can honest to God fit seven full-size adults in the Gravity, and no one is going to complain. I set up my driver's seat and the second-row seat directly behind it to be comfortable for my 6-foot-1 frame, and I still had plenty of knee, leg and headroom in the third row. It's truly remarkable. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Despite the fact it's smaller than a lot of its competition like the Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV , Cadillac Escalade IQ and Rivian R1S , the Gravity has a lot more hauling capability. Lucid says that the five-seater Gravity has a total of 119.1 cubic feet of cargo room with all of the seats folded. Seven-seaters lose about six cubic feet of cargo, but you'll live. Every Gravity also has an 8.1-cubic-foot frunk that's perfect for tailgating. It truly boggles my mind how designers and engineers were able to carve out this much room in a car that isn't that big, all while keeping it under 6,000 pounds. (Well, the five-seater weighs 5,904 pounds but the seven-seater is 6,048 pounds.) I assume it's some sort of dark, Voldemort-style magic, but I haven't been able to confirm that yet. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Unfortunately, no car is perfect, and neither is the Gravity. My test car and a few others at the first drive event had some fit, finish and tech issues. One of the most egregious was on my production-unit test car a nearly three-quarter-inch misalignment between the door card and dashboard. Other trim pieces weren't totally fitted properly, and there were some tech issues too. The massaging seats \u2014 which were great when operational \u2014 would turn on and off at random intervals, and at one point my reverse camera decided it was done for the day. I spoke with a Lucid representative who assured me that these were teething issues on very early production models, and they would be fixed before actually getting to customers. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now, but we shall see. A look outside Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik The outside of the Gravity is far more conventional-looking than the inside. That's not a bad thing at all, but you can absolutely see where the Air's DNA comes into play. It keeps the familiar lightbars and the front and rear as well as an optional platinum-colored roof (the Stealth package that blacks out the roof, exterior trim and wheels is standard). Other details like the wheel and bumper designs are clear Lucid hallmarks. Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik When it came to the overall design, Lucid clearly went for a more flowing, high-efficiency shape than a lot of new SUVs hitting the market these days. Honestly, it reminds me a bit of the Mercedes-Benz R-Class, but about 20% less minivan-ish. I really dig its look, and there are plenty of thoughtful touches that make you realize Lucid's designers pay attention to how people will be using the car, like the 90-degree opening for the rear doors that'll make entering the second and third rows that much easier. Lucid also had to move the door for the charger port pretty late in the game once it switched from a CCS charger to NACS so it would more easily fit at Tesla Superchargers with very short plug wires. It's little things like that which I appreciate. Pricy, but justified Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Pricing for the Gravity is a mixed bag. I mean, it's not cheap, that's for sure. Prices start at $96,625 for a Gravity Grand Touring (the only model available), and they only go up from there once you start adding more and more packages. My very well-equipped test car was fitted with DreamDrive 2 Pro ($6,750), a Surreal Sound 22-speaker system ($2,900), the Dynamic Handling Package ($2,900), a tech package ($3,200), the seven-seater package ($2,900) and a few other odds and ends, including the very pretty interior and exterior color schemes. It came in at $124,100, including destination. Don't get me wrong, that's a hell of a lot of money, but when you look at the competition, it's either right in line with or actually undercuts those cars. The Escalade IQ and EQS SUV start at $130,090 and $106,400 respectively, and neither of them perform as well or come nearly as well-equipped as the Gravity. Eventually, cheaper Gravitys will come. Lucid will start accepting orders for the Gravity Touring in late 2025 and I'd expect that car to start in the mid-$80,000 range. Still, there's a big bang-for-your-buck factor with the Grand Touring, even if you've got to spend a lot of bucks. Gravitational pull Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik There's really nothing the Lucid Gravity Grand Touring can't do. In a lot of ways, it's baffling. You get out of it wondering why all cars can't be this good and why other automakers aren't fighting tooth and nail every day to poach the people who work on these cars. The phrase \"jack of all trades\" gets thrown around a lot, and it's usually followed up by \"master of none.\" Here's the thing, though. The Gravity Grand Touring is sort of fantastic at everything it tries to be. It's an ultra-efficient electric vehicle with the fastest charging times in the West. It can comfortably seat seven people without breaking a sweat. It can accelerate and corner with some of the best sports cars out there. It can haul nearly 130 cubic feet of your junk without hesitation. It can tow up to 6,000 pounds. It can be used to tailgate, and it'll even handle an off-road trail. I've never driven a perfect car that can quite literally do it all, and I likely never will. However, the Gravity Grand Touring is just about as close as you can get.

You would think that would bestow on him a resistance status that at the very least grants a private office in the upper reaches of the Masonic Temple in Hollywood, where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is shot live on tape four nights a week. This is not the case. The talk-show host\u2019s workspace is very public, with an assistant\u2019s desk next to his and two more staffers peering in from the other side of a large wall of glass, much like his producers did in his early days as a shock jock. The only secluded corner holds a bathroom and a closet containing a cardboard box full of worn ties that his idol David Letterman sent him upon his retirement. \u201cI wore one, but they\u2019re so long,\u201d says Kimmel, who had a Late Night T-shirt under his suit when Jimmy Kimmel Live! debuted in 2003. His arms disappear into the box. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take one.\u201d For a decade, Kimmel was happy to be a Letterman disciple, projecting a just-snarky-to-be-here vibe, pulling pranks on Matt Damon and his own Aunt Chippy. There were chats with sidekick Guillermo Rodriguez, who was promoted, in Lettermanesque fashion, from security guard to on-air talent. It all befitted the Vegas-raised Kimmel, who before all of this was best known for co-hosting Comedy Central\u2019s The Man Show with Adam Carolla, a program that either celebrated or skewered the frat-boy lifestyle. Then, the rise and fall and rise of Donald Trump changed his life. A new Kimmel emerged. This one \u2014 initially propelled by anger at Trump and the Republicans\u2019 approach to health care and gun violence \u2014 savages Trump nightly, leading the president to make calls to Disney in 2018, urging it to rein him in. (Disney did not.) Now, Kimmel has Elon Musk in his sights. A few days after we talked, Kimmel derided Musk after he\u2019d begged for civility following a wave of Tesla vandalism and expressed bewilderment about why folks were mad at him. \u201cWell, let me see if I can explain it for you,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cWhen you pull out a chain saw to celebrate firing thousands of people, they get mad. My God. I mean, this poor guy. You do one, maybe two Nazi salutes, everybody gets all bent out of shape!\u201d Musk responded by labeling Kimmel \u201can unfunny jerk.\u201d Editor\u2019s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Kimmel and I talked in his office for two and a half hours after a March taping of his show. We made a pledge not to talk about Trump for the whole time. We sort of failed, but Kimmel did manage to work Howard Stern, Michelangelo\u2019s David, and stalker culture into one cogent soundbite. Dad-rock talk about Kimmel\u2019s good friend Huey Lewis\u2019 first band, Clover, has been edited out for space. Your office has two staffers looking in. It\u2019s hard to imagine Letterman having this kind of setup. There\u2019s no alone time. If I have a private call, it\u2019s taken in the bathroom. Are you feeling OK? During yesterday\u2019s taping, you appeared to be in some physical distress. I had some very serious stomach cramping. It just came upon me suddenly. You came close to seeing me shit my pants onstage for the first time. It\u2019s weird, whatever is going on always stops when I take the stage. If I\u2019m hiccuping, it stops. Sneezing, it stops. But diarrhea waits for no man. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should be canceled. I really don\u2019t.\u201d I see your clarinet over there. I know you\u2019re pretty good, but how the hell did you make that your instrument of choice? Well, I didn\u2019t choose it. It chose me. And I don\u2019t say that the way Jimi Hendrix might say it. I say it the way Jimmy Kimmel would say it, which is, I thought it was a trombone. I wanted to play the trombone, and thought a trombone when I was 11 years old was called a clarinet. So I signed up for clarinet class, and I got to the class, and some kids had their instruments. I told the band teacher, \u201cI\u2019m in the wrong class. I\u2019m supposed to be in the clarinet class.\u201d And he said, \u201cThis is the clarinet class.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, clarinet.\u201d I did the trombone motion with my hand. And I remember him laughing so hard. He goes, \u201cNo, that\u2019s a trombone.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll rearrange your schedule.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOK.\u201d And I went home and my mom had bought me a clarinet, and my parents never bought anything. And I didn\u2019t know you could return things. So I felt too guilty to say \u201cNo, I wanted to play the trombone.\u201d So I just said, \u201cI won\u2019t change the schedule, and I\u2019ll play the clarinet.\u201d And here we are. I hate to do this, but let\u2019s start with Trump. Donald Trump? Who\u2019s that? Yeah, used to be you think of me, you think of Guillermo or Matt Damon [not getting on the show]. Now it\u2019s Trump.

I know we should be hardened to it by now, but I\u2019m not. It is shocking to me; it seems like a comic-book villain. He seems like the kind of character that would flame out after a few years, but the fact that he\u2019s still with us is remarkable. A year ago, I would\u2019ve said I\u2019m hoping to show people who aren\u2019t paying attention to the news what\u2019s actually going on, and hoping to change things that way. Obviously, that didn\u2019t have enough impact before the election, so now I see myself more as a place to scream. From a comedy point of view, there are some advantages, right? You don\u2019t have to set the joke up, because everyone knows everything about him, so you go right to the punch line. [The problem is] he\u2019s somebody that a lot of people don\u2019t like. They don\u2019t want to hear his name. But there\u2019s always material. Some days, he gives you so much that you\u2019re throwing things away that would\u2019ve been the biggest event of the entire Bush presidency. I try not to get too deep in the weeds. I have to remind myself that this is not an expos\u00e9, it is a comedy show. When did you realize, \u201cOh, shit, this is serious and no longer just ridiculous\u201d? It was 2016, and I had Hillary Clinton on. I said to Hillary during a commercial break, \u201cI hope Trump gets the nomination. I think he\u2019ll be a slam-dunk for you.\u201d And she said, \u201cBe careful what you wish for.\u201d I\u2019m not in the group of people who thought he might win. Listen, when O.J. was found not guilty, I was just absolutely shocked. I had that same feeling. I had this faith in America that was shaken, and I still am not over it. I thought that when it comes down to it, this country, we do the right thing. That\u2019s obviously in the past. Philip Cheung for Rolling Stone You saw this up close in 2017. Your son was born with a serious heart condition while the Republicans were trying to repeal Obamacare. What made you go public about such a personal thing? There were a few things. I was sitting in the hospital; I was watching them debate this in Congress. I was watching them decide on whether Americans would have access to health insurance or not. And I am looking around this hospital and seeing all these kids and families that are obviously poor. And the idea that if these people were your next-door neighbors, you\u2019d do anything you could to help them struck me. Health care is boring, and most people don\u2019t understand it, so I just wanted to humanize it the best way I possibly could. You had Sen. Bill Cassidy on the show to explain your son\u2019s condition, and he promised that any health care bill would pass \u201cthe Jimmy Kimmel test\u201d and preexisting conditions would be covered. Then the Republican bill came out and that didn\u2019t happen. Were you surprised? I was surprised. When I spoke to Bill Cassidy on the air, I thought, \u201cThis man is a doctor. He understands this better than most politicians,\u201d and I felt that he was going to seize that moment and make himself a hero to Americans by doing the right thing, and I was quite surprised that he didn\u2019t. And thank God John McCain did. I will always be grateful to him. I wonder if that experience gave you insight into the Republican Party during the Trump years in terms of, they are not going to display a moment of courage even when it seems like it is in America\u2019s best interest. Well, they\u2019re so scared of him, I think even more so now than they were the first time around, because he\u2019s so vindictive and there\u2019s no length to which he will not go to punish you. I just don\u2019t understand how Americans can support what he\u2019s doing and the stupid stuff that he gets hung up on, like transgender sports and the stuff that affects almost no one. I know politicians do this; they pick little things they know are going to push your buttons, and those are the things that they go with, but this is an extreme that we\u2019ve never seen before. There\u2019s no decency. It\u2019s just a bunch of animals, and it\u2019s disgusting. I mean, on the Fourth of July, I still put up a flag, and I\u2019m never going to stop doing that, because I\u2019m never going to let them have that symbol. It\u2019s not their flag; it is not a MAGA brand. I wonder if you see Elon Musk in a similar light in the sense that, like Trump, he gives so much material. Well, he\u2019s kind of the same as Trump in a lot of ways. I mean, he supported Obama and then Hillary, and now it\u2019s convenient for him to support Trump. And to me, those are the worst people. I don\u2019t think Trump believes in any of it, and I don\u2019t think Elon Musk believes in it. I think Elon Musk sees this as a great way to accrue a lot of power and make a lot of money, and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing. Here\u2019s where I realized Elon Musk was a very bad person and a dangerous person: When Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, an elderly man, was viciously attacked, his first reaction was to repost a brazenly false story suggesting that it was a male prostitute that did it. That\u2019s when I realized, \u201cOh, this is a bad person. There\u2019s no depth to which he will not stoop.\u201d An old man was hit with a hammer and that\u2019s his first reaction. It\u2019s vile. \u201cOn the Fourth of July I still put up a flag. I\u2019ll never stop doing that. It is not a MAGA brand.\u201d Do you think Trump has actual true believers? Stephen Miller? Yeah, he\u2019s a scary motherfucker, that guy. Tucker Carlson? Oh, he\u2019s a complete phony. He\u2019s an opportunist. When you look at Tucker Carlson, you go, \u201cOK, this is a smart guy.\u201d And then you see him over in Russia in a supermarket holding up fruit and going, \u201cThis apple is only 12 cents. In America, you\u2019d pay 50 cents for this apple.\u201d And you go, \u201cYes, but the minimum wage in Russia is a dollar an hour.\u201d And what he\u2019s doing there is acknowledging his fans are not too swift, and he doesn\u2019t care. We published a story in 2023 that Trump was phoning ABC calling for you to be fired. You seemed pissed and yet amused. I think it\u2019s funny. I like when he admits I\u2019m bothering him. Here at the show, where we put a lot of work into lampooning him, for him to acknowledge our work is one of the few things he does that I appreciate. If he ignored us, it wouldn\u2019t be as much fun. One thing I like to think about is whether this ruins having been president for President Obama. Being president used to be a big deal. It\u2019s really been cheapened. Maybe it\u2019s how Johnny Carson and David Letterman felt when we all got talk shows. You grew up in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Was that weird or normal? It was a very normal place to grow up, and also a very abnormal place to grow up. And I didn\u2019t really understand that until I moved away. I played Little League and I was an altar boy, and we went to church every Sunday. But also, on the weekends, we would go for the $1.99 steak dinner at two o\u2019clock in the morning. I\u2019d walk around downtown Las Vegas with a video camera doing interviews with tourists, and then we\u2019d go home and we\u2019d watch it, and then we\u2019d tape over the same tape and do it again the next weekend because that was our only VHS tape. Do you remember your first Vegas show as a kid? I went to one with my buddy Cleto, who\u2019s my bandleader now. We went to see this show called Splash. There was water on the stage, and the women were topless. But the opener was Frank Gorshin, who played the Riddler on Batman. He was a stand-up comic. You could see he was dead inside opening for Splash. I remember they gave us two Heinekens, and we were pretty hammered by the time Frank wrapped up a set. We gave him a standing ovation at the end. He just glared at us. I also saw Siegfried and Roy at the Frontier Hotel, and the elephants onstage were urinating so forcefully that they were splashing these Japanese businessmen in the front row. They didn\u2019t seem happy. Tell me about your earliest comedy memories. I had an audio-cassette recorder, and before Letterman came on, I would watch Carson. And specifically when Bill Cosby was hosting for Johnny. I taped the monologue and I transcribed it, because I wanted to see what it looked like. But I didn\u2019t have any intention of being a comedian, and that never occurred to me. I had a \u201cLATENITE\u201d license plate and had a Late Night birthday cake because I love Letterman so much, not that I thought I could do it someday. \u201cComedians have a strong sense of justice, and Trump violates that.\u201d Your family seems to have been an essential part of your comedy upbringing. Many are on the show. My Aunt Chippy has always been a source of great amusement for me. I have these old notebooks where my cousin Sal and I wrote a bunch of fake Aunt Chippy quotes, which seemed like things she would say \u2014 like, \u201cFrank, goddammit, I\u2019ll punch you in the face, knock all your teeth out, and make it into a necklace.\u201d I remember my mom would scare my dad in the shower. She\u2019d scare him and laugh really hard at it. My mom used to pretend she was dead. She\u2019d lay on the ground, pretend she was dead until we cried. And then I found out my Aunt Chippy would do it too! And then my grandfather told me his mother would do it to him. And I was like, \u201cLook at this. This is a deep sickness. It deserves a psychological examination.\u201d Your Aunt Chippy is in a hilarious skit where she doesn\u2019t understand why her taxi doesn\u2019t have a driver [it\u2019s Waymo]. But my favorite is when your cousin Micki is scared first by a wax dummy of you and then by your human form, which she thinks is a wax dummy. Micki is great. Because she will believe anything. She\u2019s trusting. I once told her that there\u2019s a place called Ice Cream Town and it\u2019s got all these different stores. And you go to one store, it\u2019s the scoop-of-vanilla-ice-cream store. And then you can go across the street to the other store if you want chocolate syrup. And then there\u2019s the cherry store. And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my God, this sounds great.\u201d Meanwhile, if you really think about it, realistically, it\u2019s a huge pain in the ass. She\u2019s very sweet, and in her own way, very smart, but also very, very gullible. Cousin Sal has been with you for years, and now he\u2019s multi-platforming in every direction. Let me tell you something. I had dinner with Barack Obama the other night, and we spent a solid 15 minutes talking about Cousin Sal. He listens to the Bill Simmons and Cousin Sal podcast. And it was blowing my mind. I couldn\u2019t believe it, because my cousin Sal is, first of all, one of the most unusual and funniest people you\u2019ll ever meet in your life. And Obama was talking about \u201cParents\u2019 Corner\u201d [where Sal talks of his travails raising three boys]. The closest person I could compare Sal to that people would get is Bill Murray, in that he has impulses and acts on them, even if they\u2019re completely antisocial, and they\u2019re always funny. Are you continuing the prank tradition with your own kids? Oh, yeah. This weekend we\u2019re putting up signs in our neighborhood that say \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our chimpanzee,\u201d and warning people not to get too close to it, but if you see it, call us. We\u2019re going to put them up on the telephone poles in the neighborhood. And I got a burner phone number, so if people call they\u2019ll get a response. Radio seemed to be your gateway drug into comedy. That was where it was for me. The radio show I did when I was in high school on a college radio station, we had a fake rap band. We would make songs that were funny. And I made a lot of crank calls that I would tape, and Cleto was learning to play the piano, so he\u2019d learn certain tunes and we\u2019d make up funny songs for them. And that\u2019s when I thought, \u201cYeah, this is what I want to do. I want to be like Howard Stern.\u201d Radio is still the best medium, because they can\u2019t see you, and it\u2019s very freeing, in the same way actors are more comfortable in a costume, playing a character. Really, you can say whatever pops in your head and be really loose. Your early radio days were marked by various dismissals and other shenanigans. Tell me about some of your most infamous experiences. Looking back at the time, each time I was fired, I felt a grave injustice had been done. I now completely understand why each one of those adult men fired this young asshole who came in and immediately started fucking with them directly. I was mistakenly under the impression that as a listener, as an employee, you love hearing a disc jockey make fun of his boss. My first radio station was in Seattle. We had a guy named Larry Sharp who was the program director and the afternoon guy. And that was the best, because he was also on the air, so the listeners knew who he was. When he\u2019d drag us into the office to yell at us, we\u2019d secretly tape him and then play it back on the air the next morning and make fun of him. We called him Shar-Pei, because he looked like a wrinkly shar-pei dog. We just never stopped fucking with the guy. Then there was our program director in Tucson, Arizona. I had a hot dog, and I decided to put it in his desk, and closed the desk as I was leaving. And then the next morning, his office was unlocked, and I went in there to see if it was still in the desk. It wasn\u2019t in the desk, but it was in the trash can. So, I took it out of the trash can and put it back in the desk. And then he started locking his door. So, we were able to lift the panels of the ceiling and climb over. And as we\u2019re climbing over, it fell through. We destroyed his office. The whole wall unit came down. The office was completely destroyed because we went in there to put this hot dog back in his desk, and we\u2019re like, \u201cOh, fuck, we\u2019re going to get fired for this.\u201d So, we just closed the door. And when he came into work, he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d We acted like we didn\u2019t know what had happened. We were eventually fired from that job. I remember one thing he said. He said, \u201cI love corporate rock.\u201d And he said it in a serious way. And I remember thinking, like, \u201cOh, what a dipshit this guy is.\u201d Philip Cheung for Rolling Stone Howard Stern is one of your heroes, and is now a friend. How did you meet him? When I started on The Man Show, Comedy Central hired a publicist for us for the show, and I said to him, there\u2019s just one thing that I want to do. Because I\u2019d already been on Letterman, I wanted to be on Howard Stern. And he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, OK. All right.\u201d It took years. And we were on the show, on the phone. It was me and Adam Carolla, we were on together. And he seemed to like us OK on the air. And then Adam started filling in, in the spot that eventually became Artie Lange\u2019s spot. And he and Adam started to become friendly. And I was a little bit jealous, because Adam wasn\u2019t necessarily really even a fan of the show. Still, to this day, I listen to him every morning. I think his show is better than it has ever been. I am humbled by him. He\u2019s one of my very good friends, and he\u2019s one of the few people I can really turn to when I need advice, because he\u2019s been through all of this stuff and then some. Often, after you go after Trump hard, his defenders will post one of your bits from The Man Show, whether it\u2019s you asking women \u201cWhat\u2019s in my pocket\u201d or ogling them from behind. They call you a hypocrite. Is that fair game? Yeah, it\u2019s fair game. I think it\u2019s kind of funny, because the very people who are using those videos as an example of why I\u2019m a horrible person were probably the biggest fans of the show at that time. We did the show a little tongue-in-cheek. I mean, if you really watch the show, we are making fun of ourselves through almost the whole show. It was not meant to be taken literally that men are superior to women, but for some people, it was. I just didn\u2019t realize until the last season that what the show was really about was the friendship between me and Adam Carolla, the chemistry that was there. It was meant to be Homer Simpsonesque. But you can pull things out of context and then they are taken literally. And that\u2019s just how it goes. There seems to be a constant redrawing of what is acceptable in comedy today. I don\u2019t put limits on what I laugh at. But for me personally, as I\u2019ve grown older, as I\u2019ve matured, I won\u2019t make a joke that I wouldn\u2019t make if a person of that color or persuasion was in the room. That\u2019s how I look at it. I think a lot of the outrage is completely manufactured, and it\u2019s like, a lot of these people who are angry aren\u2019t really angry. I think these liberals who\u2019ve done such a good job of viciously attacking comedians are a big part of the reason why Trump is the president right now. What do you mean? I just think human beings in general, when you see something that makes you laugh and you see a bunch of other people laughing, and then somebody steps in with their arms folded and goes, \u201cThat\u2019s not funny, and here\u2019s why that\u2019s not funny,\u201d it just doesn\u2019t give you a good feeling about a person. And you want to say to that person, \u201cLighten up.\u201d There\u2019s no black and white when it comes to comedy. There is no line. The line is different for every person. Dave Chappelle can say things that somebody else might not be able to. I don\u2019t think anybody should be canceled. I really don\u2019t. \u201cI think a lot of the outrage is completely manufactured.\u201d This isn\u2019t a cancel-culture question, but your friend Adam spread a lot of misinformation about the L.A. fires in January. Did you have any urge to pick up the phone and call him on it? I know he\u2019s a good person. I also know his house was right in the middle of those fires. So, he\u2019s coming from a point of view that a lot of people aren\u2019t coming from. And I know that he has preconceived notions, true or false, about the people who run this city and who run this state. I\u2019m not the kind of person who will cut someone out of my life just because we don\u2019t believe the same thing. It doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t try to make my case. I\u2019m not going to end the relationship because of that. I know people who do and who feel that way, and I respect that, too. I know it\u2019s just hard for them. There\u2019s no hope for us if we stop talking to each other. When you have deep ties to somebody, you can\u2019t just cut it off. From your mom to your wife, Molly, who\u2019s the head writer for your show, women have played a significant part in your comedy, which some might feel is odd for a guy whose breakthrough was The Man Show. You gravitate to what you\u2019re comfortable with. And for me, my mother was the class wit of her huge high school in Brooklyn. My Aunt Chippy, as you know, is really just a very, very funny person. My sister is a comedian. There are a lot of very funny women in my family. That\u2019s what I\u2019m comfortable with. I would never be in a relationship with a woman who isn\u2019t funny. I don\u2019t think a woman who isn\u2019t funny would even have any reason to be attracted to me. My wife is very bright, very ethical, and also is very funny. And I think that that\u2019s a rare combination. And to be able to run some of these half-baked notions I have by her and vice versa, and to kind of figure them out before I come into work, is a great thing to have. And I\u2019m sure I abuse it. I mean, there are times where I will actually make noise to wake her up because I think of something funny that I want to share, and I can\u2019t wait. Like a child. But there are lines. I recently changed my wife\u2019s license plate to \u201cWE B JAMMIN,\u201d and she didn\u2019t love that. I talked to James Corden eight years ago about the breakdown of the late-night audience, and here we are again. CBS recently canceled After Midnight. How do you see the landscape in 2025? ABC pays me. So ideally, in an ideal world, everybody would watch [our show] on ABC. But it\u2019s just not how it works. It\u2019s very easy to watch it on YouTube. People can watch anything at a moment\u2019s notice now, and in late night I find most of the people are watching me the next day. That\u2019s the next day in the morning. But if you look at YouTube, and you look at all the shows, more people are watching our late-night television than ever were. And that is what any comedian wants. In the past couple of years, you have talked of retirement. Do you revisit that every year? I\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s no point in talking about it. It upsets the people I work with. \u201cI won\u2019t cut someone out of my life because we don\u2019t believe the same thing.\u201d I did a story about Tom Petty on his last tour and saw a bunch of shows. And he\u2019d play great for two hours and then need the next 46 hours to recover. When I talked to him, he hinted that at least part of it was that he still loved to play, but so many people were depending on him for jobs that he felt a responsibility to keep going. I wonder if you feel that. Oh, absolutely. It\u2019s a huge part of the responsibility. There are a lot of people who won\u2019t have jobs when I retire. That definitely weighs on me. But the reality is I\u2019m not going to do this forever. At a certain point, it is going to have to end. I also know there\u2019s not one person who works here who would resent me for retiring. I think they know that when I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll feel like I have done this as long as I possibly can. But you always feel like the bandleader, that when you stop everyone is going to have to find new jobs. You can get very emotional on air, whether talking about your son or your monologue after Trump was reelected. Have you always been so open with your emotions? I cried on the last Man Show, which is kind of funny. I just have a hard time keeping my emotions within. My father is like that. And honestly, it\u2019s embarrassing to me. And I know a lot of the women that work here would be like, \u201cOh, I think it\u2019s great. It shows a good side of you.\u201d But if I could turn it off, I would. I try to attach these events to real people, and that\u2019s what I did after the election, and I just know how much misery is in store for so many people and how unnecessary it is. I mean, we had plenty of problems before him. The idea that we\u2019ve now created a whole new set of problems seems so counter\u00adproductive, and it\u2019s just disheartening. It overwhelms me, just thinking about the realities; it can hit me pretty hard. Tonight on the show, you did a bit about lame Democrats doing some kind of Congress warrior-ninja video. It was cringe. What are the Democrats doing wrong, or what could be done differently just to get them back in the game? Or do we just need to let Trump blow himself up for the first six months or year of his second term? I think there\u2019s got to be some combination. It\u2019s just like, I know for sure that there are charismatic, intelligent, even funny people [in the Democratic Party]. I mean, Jasmine Crockett, one night, I\u2019m playing a clip of her being hilarious. And the next night she\u2019s participating in this. It looks like a video that the PTA would make to entertain at the luncheon. And it\u2019s just got to be better than that. Say what you want about Trump, we played a clip in rehearsal of Biden\u2019s State of the Union address and Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. The energy in the room, it\u2019s like the difference between golf and wrestling. There\u2019s just a huge amount of energy in the room, and it\u2019s undeniable. And when people ask me why they think Trump won, I really believe the reason more than anything is he\u2019s so much more famous than Kamala Harris. He is a celebrity. He is a star. He is the most famous person in the world. And it\u2019s hard to compete with that. Let\u2019s try to end on a happier note. You recently went to Italy with Howard and your wives. He became quite reclusive during the pandemic. How did you persuade him to go? It\u2019s very simple. He wanted to go. He can\u2019t admit this stuff, even to himself. Of course he wants to go to Italy. But for Howard, it takes a long time. He\u2019s got to get there. And I think he had a great time. We were looking at the statue of David sculpted by Michelangelo himself. At a certain point, Howard and I realized that every single person in the room had turned their cameras to us and were photographing us looking at David. And it was the weirdest fucking thing, to be in another country and to suddenly steal the attention away from David. STEPHEN RODRICK is a senior writer at \u00ad Rolling Stone.

Why Progressives Increasingly Support Violence City Journal ^ | 14 Apr, 2025 | Zack Dulberg, Max Horder Posted on 04/15/2025 5:47:13 AM PDT by MtnClimber A new survey finds more than half of left-wing respondents believe assassinating Donald Trump could be justified. Political violence in America is not just a relic of the past. From the attempted assassinations of Donald Trump to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to the burning of Teslas in protest of Elon Musk, political violence is a present-day reality. More than 9,000 threats have been made against members of Congress this year\u2014a \u201chuge increase,\u201d according to officials. Are these events aberrations or do they reflect a national problem? Are they connected? And does the public support them? A new report from our group, the Network Contagion Research Institute, provides answers. Our research, based on nationally representative surveys and analyses of online activity, demonstrates the existence of online subcultures that support the murder of public figures like Trump and Musk. This \u201cassassination culture,\u201d incubated on social media, has migrated from the margins of public life into the mainstream. We found that nearly one-third of Americans surveyed\u2014and around half of those identifying as left-of-center\u2014believe that the murder of certain public figures is at least somewhat justified. The figures are startling: 38 percent of respondents, and 55 percent of those left of center, said assassinating President Trump would be at least somewhat justified; 31 percent of respondents, and 48 percent of those left of center, said the same about Musk. Forty percent of respondents, and 58 percent of those left of center, deem it at least somewhat acceptable to \u201cdestroy a Tesla dealership\u201d in protest. Our report also discovered an online \u201cassassination culture,\u201d found in predominantly left-leaning digital spaces, such as Bluesky and Reddit. This subculture justifies and glorifies political violence. Some of these networks\u2019 users wield the name \u201cLuigi\u201d or use the Luigi video game character as coded endorsements of Brian Thompson\u2019s alleged assassin, Luigi Mangione. These users cloak explicit calls for violence in stylized memes. Many believe that political murder and sabotage are acceptable forms of protest. What motivates these attitudes? To answer that, we looked for statistical associations between respondents\u2019 backing for political violence and other psychological and behavioral measures. We identified three key variables that predict support for violence: left-wing authoritarianism (characterized by a willingness to use coercion and punishment for progressive aims), external locus of control (the extent to which individuals feel powerless in their lives), and use of the left-wing social media platform Bluesky. This finding is especially concerning, as it reveals that many progressives have adopted a coherent ideology that justifies political violence. While right-wing extremism certainly exists, its left-wing equivalent merits considerable attention. Unfortunately, it has been historically understudied and, according to corroborating reports, is on the rise. The rise of this ideology is troubling for American democracy. Political assassinations often occur when perpetrators believe a critical share of the public will tolerate\u2014or even justify\u2014them. Given the growing number of Americans who now express support for political violence, and the surge in threats to political figures, we recommend heightened security precautions across all levels of government. These attitudes reflect a deeper pathology in our political culture: social media has magnified feelings of powerlessness and redirected them toward violent extremism. Confronting this contagion requires moral clarity and a renewed commitment to America\u2019s founding principles. Civil disagreement must replace online hostility, and political leaders must denounce violence\u2014without qualification\u2014as incompatible with a constitutional republic. If we fail to hold that line, the future may echo the darkest chapters of our past.

Democratize crypto from the palm of your hand. The Pi Network quickly went viral, spreading through invitation-only mining that created a sense of exclusivity and social virality. By 2021, the app had surpassed 20 million engaged users, or \u201cPioneers,\u201d and by late 2023, that number had reportedly hit 47 million, making it one of the largest pre-mainnet crypto communities in the world. Here\u2019s a quick timeline of key moments: March 2019: The Pi Network launches a beta version of its app on Android and iOS. 2020\u20132021: User growth accelerates through referrals; Pi phases move toward testnet. December 2021: Closed mainnet goes live; Pi transactions remain within the ecosystem. 2022\u20132024: Over 100 Pi apps are built for testing in the closed economy. February 2025: Pi Network officially launches its open mainnet, enabling blockchain interaction with the outside world. This long-awaited mainnet move opened the doors for Pi (PI) coin to be listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and used outside its sandbox \u2014 finally bringing the project closer to its goal of becoming a real digital currency for everyday use. From an ambitious student project to one of the most downloaded crypto apps ever, Pi Network\u2019s journey has been anything but ordinary. But now that the tech is live and tradable, the big question is: Can you actually use Pi coin to buy things? Did you know? Over 2 million users voted for Binance to list Pi coin \u2014 and yet, Binance has remained completely silent. Despite Pi Network boasting 47 million users and a fully launched mainnet, the world\u2019s biggest exchange hasn\u2019t budged. Why? Some say it\u2019s a lack of decentralization. Others point to the controlled KYC rollout. Either way, it\u2019s a reminder that in crypto, even a viral army can\u2019t force the gatekeepers to open the doors. Where can you buy Pi coin in 2025? Following the launch of Pi Network\u2019s open mainnet in February 2025 , Pi coin has become available for trading on several cryptocurrency exchanges. As of April 2025, Pi coin is listed on the following exchanges:\u200b OKX: One of the first to list PI, offering trading pairs such as PI/USDT.\u200b Bitget: Provides PI trading with liquidity and user-friendly interfaces.\u200b MEXC: Another early adopter, supporting PI trading pairs.\u200b BitMart: Supports PI trading, though some listings may be IOUs.\u200b HTX (formerly Huobi): Has listed PI, though it\u2019s based on IOU listings. Despite community efforts, including over 2 million votes in favor, Binance has not listed Pi coin as of April 2025. Concerns over blockchain compatibility, transparency and regulatory issues have been touted as reasons for the hesitation. Did you know? Many Pi coin listings on exchanges are actually IOUs, which is not the real deal. These \u201cI Owe You\u201d tokens are speculative placeholders that aren\u2019t backed by mainnet Pi, meaning you can\u2019t withdraw or use them within the Pi Network ecosystem. It\u2019s like trading a movie ticket for a film that hasn\u2019t even premiered yet. Always check whether you\u2019re buying the actual PI token or just a promise. What can you actually buy with Pi coin? Here\u2019s where things get real (or not so real). While you might not be buying a Tesla with Pi (yet), the Pi community has been documenting purchases such as: T-shirts, mugs and phone accessories Freelance graphic design services Basic electronics and gadgets Food, drinks and small restaurant meals (in localized Pi events) Handmade crafts and collectibles. The catch? Most of these transactions happen via social media groups, Telegram chats or Pi\u2019s own ecosystem apps such as Pi Browser and Pi Chat. These platforms act as informal marketplaces, often relying on trust and reputation rather than formal escrow systems. So, while Pi isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time in major retail environments, it is functioning \u2014 in a grassroots, community-driven way. Think of it more as a barter system with crypto flair than a fully integrated payment network. For now, at least. Pi Network merchant list \u2014 fact or fiction? If you search \u201cPi coin accepted stores\u201d on Google, hoping for a list of your favorite retailers, you\u2019ll be disappointed. There is no official Pi Network merchant list that guarantees where Pi is accepted. Instead, adoption is grassroots and highly localized. One group of Pi Pioneers in Indonesia might be able to buy food with Pi, while another in Vietnam uses it for mobile data top-ups. But it\u2019s hard to track, standardize or verify. Merchant adoption is still early \u2014 but gaining traction. Now that Pi Network\u2019s open mainnet is live , the conversation is no longer about \u201cif\u201d Pi will integrate with the broader crypto ecosystem \u2014 it\u2019s about how fast it can onboard real merchants and use cases. One promising trend is the rise of Know Your Customer (KYC)-verified Pi apps, platforms that require users and businesses to complete identity verification before participating in the Pi economy. This layer of trust helps Pi Network build a more legitimate commercial environment, where merchants feel more confident accepting Pi coin as payment. In the months following the open mainnet launch, Pi Network\u2019s developers and community have focused on scaling real-world integrations, which include: Local businesses in countries such as Nigeria, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines accept Pi for goods and services. Pi Chain Mall and other marketplaces are enabling digital commerce in Pi. Third-party integrations are being tested to connect Pi with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, crosschain bridges and non-fungible token (NFT) platforms. Pi Browser and Pi Apps allow decentralized application (DApp) developers to launch new payment-enabled services using mainnet Pi. With over 100 Pi apps already built during the testnet phase \u2014 and a global army of KYC-verified users \u2014 Pi Network now has the tools to grow a real, scalable economy. Whether that turns into a bustling merchant network or a niche payment layer depends on what the community builds next. With that said, there\u2019s growing interest in onboarding merchants through KYC-verified Pi apps, hinting at a slow but potentially scalable adoption model. Now with the open mainnet live, Pi is also expected to launch integrated DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and NFT marketplaces. If these integrations succeed, serious use cases beyond the Pi bubble could be unlocked. Did you know? During PiFest 2025, over 1.8 million users engaged in transactions using Pi coin across 58,000 active merchants worldwide. This event showcased Pi Network\u2019s growing real-world adoption and its potential to facilitate everyday commerce. Is Pi coin ready for real-world payments? Let\u2019s be honest: Pi coin isn\u2019t a Visa killer at the moment. It\u2019s not ready to power global commerce or even compete with Bitcoin in El Salvador . However, it serves as a testbed for what crypto payments might look like when driven by community trust rather than institutional backing. Think of it less like a universal payment tool and more like a local barter system on crypto steroids. If the Pi Network nails its open mainnet rollout and expands merchant onboarding with real compliance and liquidity support, 2025 could mark the moment Pi goes from playful experiment to actual contender. Final verdict: Can you buy stuff with Pi coin? Yes \u2014 but with limitations. You can spend Pi coin, but only in select peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, community-driven stores or pilot programs run by Pi Pioneers. Most of it is still happening in closed circuits, with no large-scale merchant integration yet. But is that really a problem? Maybe not. After all, the early days of Bitcoin weren\u2019t much different \u2014 experimental, niche and often dismissed. Back then, buying a pizza with Bitcoin ( BTC ) was groundbreaking. Now, BTC sits in exchange-traded fund (ETF) portfolios and corporate treasuries . Whether Pi Network breaks through or fades into obscurity depends on what happens next: regulatory clarity and whether the network can scale beyond its internal community. Believer or skeptic, one thing\u2019s certain: The real-world test of the Pi Network economy is just getting started \u2014 and the world is watching. # Blockchain # Payments # Adoption # How to # Pi Network Add reaction Editor\u2019s Choice Crypto in a bear market, rebound likely in Q3 \u2014 Coinbase Bitcoin trader sees gold 'blow-off top' as XAU nears new $3.3K record Riskiest, most \u2018addictive\u2019 crypto game of 2025, PIXEL goes multi-game: Web3 Gamer Crypto\u2019s debanking problem persists despite new regulations Crypto podcasters should always assume their audience knows nothing Advertise with us", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-you-really-buy-anything-with-pi-coin-find-out-here", "source": "Cointelegraph", "published_at": "2025-04-15T12:47:00"}, {"id": 1665, "title": "Those reporting BYD overtook Tesla as top global electric vehicle maker are wrong", "content": "Those reporting BYD overtook Tesla as top global electric vehicle maker are wrong | Electrek Skip to main content Those reporting BYD overtook Tesla as top global electric vehicle maker are wrong Micah Toll | Apr 15 2025 - 5:41 am PT 42 Comments In the past few weeks, major news outlets have reported that Chinese automotive giant BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world\u2019s largest seller of electric vehicles. While it may be true that BYD has usurped Tesla to sell more electric vehicles or generate more revenue, the idea that either is the largest EV seller in the world completely ignores a company that sells more EVs each year than both Tesla and BYD combined. Those EVs just have half the wheels. I\u2019m talking, of course, about the real global leader in electric vehicle sales: Yadea , a company that builds electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, outselling by a long shot Tesla and BYD combined. Of course part of this argument is semantical, and it also depends on how you definite the world\u2019s largest seller. Many recent articles about BYD overtaking Tesla refer to BYD\u2019s 2024 annual revenue, which eclipsed Tesla\u2019s for the same period. To be fair, that feat is even more impressive considering Tesla enjoys a relatively large sales volume in BYD\u2019s domestic market of China, whereas BYD is prevented from selling in Tesla\u2019s domestic market of the US, one of the largest global automotive markets. Advertisement - scroll for more content While Yadea can\u2019t compete with overall revenue due to its vehicles being much more affordable, that\u2019s kind of the point. Yadea sells as many EVs in a quarter as Tesla and BYD do in a year, and for much more affordable prices. In fact, Yadea\u2019s recent announcement of surpassing 100 million cumulative electric two-wheelers sold globally puts both automakers\u2019 figures in perspective. On an annual basis, Yadea consistently sells more than 6-8 million electric scooters, bicycles, and motorcycles, comfortably surpassing the combined annual sales of Tesla and BYD. Top comment by Grant Liked by 10 people Interesting point Micah. These electric vehicles are displacing gas versions and collectively making a big difference. View all comments Why, then, does the media often ignore Yadea when crowning the king of EV sales? Simply put, there\u2019s still an automotive bias that sees cars as \u201creal\u201d vehicles and treats two-wheelers as a side note. It\u2019s understandable, and even my own well-meaning colleagues here at Electrek can occasionally be guilty of it . But this attitude misses an essential point: For millions of people worldwide, especially in densely populated urban centers throughout Asia and increasingly in Europe and North America, an electric scooter or bicycle isn\u2019t just a real vehicle \u2013 it\u2019s often the most sensible, efficient, and affordable choice. Two-wheeled electric vehicles offer numerous practical advantages over cars. They\u2019re dramatically more energy-efficient, cheaper to buy, cheaper to run, easier to maintain, and fit seamlessly into urban lifestyles where space is limited and traffic congestion is the norm. Electric scooters and bikes aren\u2019t just vehicles; they\u2019re solutions to pressing urban issues like air pollution, traffic congestion, and affordability. Most young urban commuters can\u2019t afford a new Tesla, nor can they charge its battery in the living room of their fifth-floor apartment. But a typical e-bike or e-scooter solves both of those problems, bringing affordability and convenience to the electric vehicle market. Moreover, Yadea reaching the incredible milestone of 100 million electric vehicle sales highlights the sheer scale and impact of electric two-wheelers globally. And that\u2019s just one company. For comparison, Tesla recently celebrated surpassing just over 7 million total vehicles, and BYD, despite its rapid growth, is still far behind Yadea in cumulative units delivered. The takeaway here is clear: Let\u2019s not get caught up in automotive tunnel vision. If we truly care about electrification and sustainability, it\u2019s vital to recognize that the global electric vehicle market is bigger \u2013 and more diverse \u2013 than cars alone. Companies like Yadea aren\u2019t just quietly outselling Tesla and BYD; they\u2019re providing practical mobility solutions that might just be the \u201cbetter\u201d electric vehicles that millions of people actually need.

Elon Musk gives one of two Nazi-style salutes on Jan. 20, 2025. Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday that it charged Jamison R. Wagner, a 40-year-old from Albuquerque, New Mexico, with arson for allegedly setting fires at a Tesla showroom in the city as well as the local Republican Party headquarters. The charges come as Tesla CEO Elon Musk remains the focus of widespread public anger over his unlawful destruction of the U.S. government and his far-right extremist views about race and immigration. The U.S. government alleges Wagner damaged two Tesla vehicles at the Tesla Showroom in Albuquerque, New Mexico, during the early morning hours of Feb. 9, 2025. One of the vehicles appears to have significant damage, according to a photo released by DOJ , but another vehicle appears to simply have a window smashed. The DOJ alleges that an \u201cintact glass container\u201d was found in the second vehicle \u201ccontaining an improvised napalm material.\u201d Damaged Tesla vehicles in a photograph published by the U.S. Department of Justice. Photo: DOJ The building of the Tesla Showroom and six other vehicles on the property were hit with graffiti reading \u201cDie Elon,\u201d \u201cTesla Nazi Inc,\u201d and \u201cDie Tesla Nazi,\u201d as well as swastikas. Musk, who\u2019s still operating the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), infamously made two Nazi-style salutes on the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025. Musk has denied he was trying to invoke the Nazis, but anyone with eyes to see can understand why reasonable people would assume the billionaire was welcoming the second Trump era with an explicit embrace of Nazism. The oligarch has embraced far-right ideology and expressed some extremely antisemitic and racist ideas over recent years. Photo: DOJ DOJ published photos it said were taken from surveillance footage appearing to show a person in a black hooded sweatshirt. It\u2019s not clear whether that person is actually Wagner, though the government insists it is. \u201cHurling firebombs is not political protest,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement posted online . \u201cIt is a dangerous felony that we will prosecute to the maximum extent. The impressive work by law enforcement in New Mexico sends a clear message to perpetrators of all of the shameful attacks on Tesla facilities and political establishments: we are coming for you, you can\u2019t hide, and you will do serious jail time to pay for your crimes.\u201d The FBI issued a statement in late March noting that there have been attacks on Tesla-related property in at least nine states. And while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has tried to insist that attacks on Tesla facilities, along with peaceful demonstrations, are all being paid for by some shadowy figures, there\u2019s no evidence that this is the case. DOJ also alleges Wagner attacked the Republican Party New Mexico (RPNM) office in the early morning hours of March 30, 2025. Two or three glass containers with flammable liquids were allegedly used to damage the door of the building, while the words ICE=KKK were spray-painted outside. Wagner was arrested on April 12, 2025, by agents from the FBI and ATF, according to the DOJ press release. \u201cLet this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,\u201d said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. \u201cWe will arrest you, we will prosecute you, and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.\u201d Wagner has been charged with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives and faces 5-20 years for each of the two counts, according to DOJ.

Polygon, Avail Co-Founders Talk to Gadgets 360 Cryptocurrency profits are taxed at 30 percent in India, but the government has yet to introduce regulations to govern the sector. Written by Radhika Parashar , Edited by David Delima | Updated: 15 April 2025 18:02 IST Photo Credit: Unsplash The valuation of the crypto sector currently stands at $2.7 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,31,56.903 crore) Highlights The US is set to create strategic crypto reserves The country will add seized crypto funds to its crypto reserves India\u2019s crypto regulations remain awaited Advertisement US President Donald Trump announced the creation of separate reserves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the US last month, in a boost for the digital assets sector. The decision prompted Sweden and South Korea to open dialogue around considering Bitcoin as a potential reserved asset. There's currently no word on whether the Government of India is planning to establish a strategic crypto reserve. Gadgets 360 discussed the possibility of India's Bitcoin reserve with Polygon and Avail co-founders Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun. Pros and Cons of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Polygon founder Nailwal said that US President Donald Trump has kickstarted a race to acquire Bitcoin and other altcoins for long-term benefits to the US economy. He said that India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, may regret its conservative approach on crypto if it fails to catch up with other big economies in a timely manner. \u201cThe world is long past the days when Bitcoin was considered an experiment or simply a haven for criminals. Some of the world's largest asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, and national governments have invested large amounts of money in BTC and the broader altcoin market, indicating the rising adoption of the asset class,\u201d Nailwal told Gadgets 360. Crypto Trading Booms in India's Smaller Cities Abu Dhabi's investment company, Mubadala and Norway's Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) are prominent financial firms that have begun to deal with Bitcoin via investments in pro-crypto firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFs. In India, Mumbai-based IT training firm Jetking has acquired Bitcoin tokens worth Rs. 10 crore. The January 2025 edition of the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report projected India's economy to grow at a steady rate of 6.7 percent in both FY26 and FY27, significantly outpacing global and regional peers. The IMF also estimates India's growth to remain robust at 6.5 percent for 2025 and 2026. \"India can seriously consider creating a crypto stockpile to diversify its reserves and elevate the integration of blockchain with its economic ecosystem,\" Nailwal said. However, Polygon chief also cautioned that the authorities need to strengthen tech infrastructure, cybersecurity, and introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies before establishing a crypto reserve. Existing gaps in crypto awareness, legal provisions, and enforcement of criminal punishments could pose risks to India's financial stability if crypto is considered as a reserved asset. India Set to Overtake US as Largest Web3 Developer Hub by 2028: Report Possible Avenues to Set Up Crypto Reserves India can allocate one to two percent of its foreign exchange reserves to crypto assets as a pragmatic starting point, Avail Co-Founder Anurag Arjun told Gadgets 360. Avail is a blockchain firm that supports the design of Web3 applications. Arjun also co-founded Polygon alongside Nailwal in 2017 but exited the firm in 2023. \"India needs to see the creation of a crypto reserve as more than just about jumping on a trend. It's more about positioning India strategically in a rapidly evolving global financial landscape,\" Arjun said. \u201cAn small allocation of India's foreign exchange reserves to crypto makes for a modest exposure that limits risk while enabling India to experiment strategically, mirroring institutions like BlackRock (managing $50 billion in Bitcoin ETFs) and corporations like MicroStrategy, whose stock surged 1,500 percent after adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. In the short term, such a move would position India as a forward-thinking economy, attracting blockchain innovation and global capital,\u201d he added. Avail's co-founder also highlighted that Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million tokens offers protection against inflationary pressures in traditional currencies, serving as a hedge against monetary instability in an increasingly uncertain world. \u201cWith 17 percent of the global population and a tech-savvy workforce, India has the demographic and intellectual capital to lead rather than follow. Digital assets offer a hedge against dollar hegemony, a tool for financial inclusion, and a bridge to the digital economy\u2014critical for sustaining growth in a digitising world. A late entry into the race would mean acquiring assets at significantly higher prices, placing India at a strategic disadvantage,\u201d he added. India is also at liberty to keenly analyse US' step of putting seized crypto funds into its crypto reserves. In February this year, India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized its biggest crypto fund worth Rs. 1,646 crore investigating a money laundering case. Other similar probes have also roped in hefty crypto funds that have been placed under the custodies of Binance, ZepPay, WazirX , and CoinDCX . Financial Analyst Suggests Caution Nimen Shah, a senior chartered accountant and international tax advisor from Mumbai, said India's financial position is on solid ground, which eliminates any urgency for it to venture into creating crypto reserves. \"Cryptocurrencies are volatile and still largely unregulated. They enable private financial transactions without the involvement of any central bank or broker, making them susceptible to misuse by criminals. Because crypto lets individuals process financial transactions without an intermediary, it threatens the autonomy and control of central banks on a global level,\" Shah told Gadgets 360. Over the last few years, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted its ban on crypto, while the government introduced a 30 percent tax on cryptocurrency incomes, which has been criticised by many crypto investors. In 2024, former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das called crypto risky and highly speculative, addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also stated last year that crypto cannot be viewed as a legitimate currency in India. \u201cIndia need not rush into a creating a crypto reserve. Given the apprehensions of the RBI and other stakeholders, it would be a very long leap to go from zero regulations to crypto reserves,\u201d Shah said, while dismissing the idea of crypto becoming an alternative to the US dollar for India. He said that crypto activities are more intensive in the US than in India. \u201cCrypto is not big enough either as an industry or as an acceptable enough asset class to impact our monetary policy or our financial system. We are a long way away from there,\u201d Shah added. As of Tuesday, the valuation of the crypto sector stood at $2.7 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,31,56.903 crore) with over 13 million tokens in circulation. Bitcoin, the most expensive crypto token, is presently trading at $85,600 (roughly Rs. 73.4 lakh).

The next day Musk replied to the post, \u201cSome people just want to watch the world burn,\u201d an iconic line from the 2008 Batman film \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Alfred, the Wayne family\u2019s faithful butler, says the line to Bruce Wayne \u2013 Batman \u2013 to describe the motivations behind the Joker\u2019s chaotic acts of violence. Musk \u2013 and Alfred \u2013 was right. Some people do, in fact, say they think that society should be burned to the ground. It\u2019s part of a psychological measure political psychologists created called \u201c need for chaos .\u201d New data from the Center for Political Communication at the University of Delaware suggests that those people \u2013 the ones who want society to burn \u2013 are the ones with more, not less, trust in Musk. They also report more trust in the Department of Government Efficiency, the government entity Musk advises, which the Trump administration claims it created to cut government waste and fraud. Yet, critics point out that Musk and DOGE\u2019s seemingly indiscriminate approach to spending cuts risks damaging the infrastructure necessary for American innovation. This desire to watch the world burn doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Fear of losing status Somewhat like the Joker, whose perpetual sense of victimhood \u2013 \u201c You wanna know how I got these scars? \u201d \u2013 drove his need for chaos and destruction, people can develop a need for chaos in response to a sense that they are losing. When political psychologists introduced this concept of \u201cneed for chaos\u201d in 2021 , they described it not as a psychological trait, but as a character adaptation that occurs when some people experience a cultural and political situation that makes them feel like they are losing status and power. For some people, this feeling triggers a desire to \u201cburn it all down\u201d \u2013 \u201cit\u201d being society, institutions, the world \u2013 maybe to rebuild it all anew, or maybe just to see it all destroyed. Only a small percentage of the U.S. population \u2013 less than 15% \u2013 tends to score high in need for chaos. But even so, understanding this minority is important to gaining insight into this political moment. For example, people who score high in need for chaos exhibit greater support for political violence and a willingness to knowingly share hostile and false information online . And in our data, those higher in need for chaos report holding more trust in Musk, DOGE and Trump than people who score lower in the need for chaos measure. Who wants to burn it down We are political psychologists who study the link between psychological traits and political beliefs. Last month, the University of Delaware\u2019s Center for Political Communication ran a national survey that we designed to understand where the public stands on various political issues and how those beliefs relate to psychological traits, including need for chaos. In our national study of 1,600 Americans conducted between Feb. 27-March 5, 2025, by YouGov, we asked respondents how much they agreed or disagreed with the following statements: \u2022 \u201cI fantasize about a natural disaster wiping out most of humanity such that a small group of people can start all over\u201d \u2022 \u201cI think society should be burned to the ground\u201d \u2022 \u201cWe cannot fix the problems in our social institutions; we need to tear them down and start over\u201d \u2022 \u201cI need chaos around me \u2013 it is too boring if nothing is going on\u201d Similar to prior work by author Kevin Arceneaux and his colleagues , our data shows that a very small number \u2013 fewer than 20% of the sample \u2013 agrees strongly or agrees somewhat with each item. However, looking at need for chaos among groups of varying ages, education levels and media habits, we find the highest need for chaos scores among people under age 40, those with less education, and those who pay the least attention to politics. Burning it down through government policy Our new data also shows that while people highest in need for chaos report having more trust in Musk, DOGE, and President Trump, these chaos-seeking folks report having less trust in \u201cpeople in general,\u201d journalists or the federal government. These findings hold even when statistically accounting for other factors, among them party, race, gender, education and ideology. Musk\u2019s penchant for wielding chainsaws as a symbol of DOGE\u2019s work provides some insight into why chaos seekers may like what they see in Musk. It\u2019s not clear exactly what Musk\u2019s aim is with his work at DOGE, as he eliminates the jobs of hundreds of thousands of government workers. What is clear, however, is that by many accounts, the mass firings and the gutting of agencies, like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Institute for Peace, are sowing chaos . And a significant portion of Americans want just that. Political psychology Doge Batman Donald Trump Elon Musk Political violence Joker Want to write?

(NASDAQ: TMDX) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in TransMedics , you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/transmedics-group-inc . Investors have until April 15, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased TransMedics securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and is captioned Jewik v. TransMedics Group, Inc. et al , No. 25-cv-10385. Why was TransMedics Sued for Fraud? TransMedics is a commercial-stage medical technology company. The Company\u2019s \u201cOrgan Care System\u201d (\u201cOCS\u201d) is a medical device that keeps donor organs viable before transplant by replicating many aspects of the organ\u2019s natural living and functioning environment outside of the human body. The complaint alleges that TransMedics misrepresented that its business was driven by kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics. The complaint further alleges that the company misrepresented that it engaged in unsafe practices involving OCS, hid safety issues, and generally lacked safety oversight. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On February 21, 2024, U.S. Representative and member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Paul Gosar issued a letter accusing the Company of misconduct including overcharging for OCS and misappropriating corporate resources. This news allegedly caused the price of TransMedics stock to decline approximately 4% over two trading days, from $86.99 per share on February 21, 2024 to $83.14 per share on February 23, 2024. On December 2, 2024, TransMedics announced the resignation of its CFO from that role and narrowed its financial outlook for 2024. Then, on January 10, 2025, Scorpion Capital issued a research report explaining that TransMedics\u2019s growth was fueled by an anti-competitive scheme that included kickbacks to medical providers to use the company\u2019s products and that TransMedics further boosted growth by operating an organ trafficking scheme, engaged in widespread billing fraud, and promoted off-label use. The publication of the Scorpion Capital report caused the price of TransMedics stock to decline an additional 5%, from $72.55 per share on January 8, 2025 to $68.81 per share on January 10, 2025.

(NASDAQ: VTRS) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Viatris, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/viatris-inc . Investors have until June 3, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Viatris securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and is captioned Quinn v. Viatris Inc., et al. , No. 25-cv-466. Why was Viatris Sued for Securities Fraud? Viatris is a global healthcare company that supplies medicines to about 1 billion patients across more than 165 countries and territories. The complaint alleges that Viatris stated its facilities were in \u201cgood operating condition,\u201d were \u201csuitable for their intended purposes,\u201d and that the Company was \u201ccommitted to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards.\u201d However, on December 23, 2024, the Company revealed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued a Warning Letter following a failed inspection at the Company\u2019s Indore, India, facility. Still, Viatris downplayed the situation, describing it as a \u201clittle bit of headwind\u201d and spoke about \u201cactive discussions with the FDA\u201d to get additional products produced at the facility exempted from the FDA\u2019s Import Alert. In truth, the ramifications of the failed FDA inspection resulted in a significant headwind to the Company\u2019s financial results as it prevented the Company from manufacturing and distributing key products, including Lenalidomide. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On February 27, 2025, the Company released its Q4 2024 results and provided 2025 guidance. The Company revealed that the \u201cnegative impact\u201d of the Indore facility\u2019s failed inspection would lower 2025 revenue by \u201capproximately $500 million\u201d and 2025 earnings from operations by \u201capproximately $385 million.\u201d The Company further disclosed that the failed inspection at its Indore facility prevented it from identifying alternative supply options for Lenalidomide and from obtaining further product exemptions from the FDA. On this news, the price of Viatris stock declined roughly 15% during the trading day, from a closing price of $11.24 per share on February 26, 2025, to $9.53 per share on February 27, 2025.

The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is captioned Quinn v. Ready Capital Corporation, et al. , No. 25-cv- 01883. Why was Ready Capital Sued for Securities Fraud? Ready Capital is a real estate finance company which originates, acquires, finances and services lower-to-middle-market (LLM) commercial real estate (CRE) loans, small business administration loans, residential mortgage loans, and other real estate-related investments. As alleged, Ready Capital misrepresented the credit performance of its loans, stating that its \u201cCRE portfolio is showing stabilizing credit metrics\u201d and that it was \u201cwell positioned to capitalize on the tailwinds in the CRE market.\u201d In reality, Ready Capital\u2019s CRE portfolio was plagued by non-performing loans and its CRE portfolio had not stabilized. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On March 3, 2025, Ready Capital announced financial results for 4Q 24, disclosing that it would recognize a $382 million charge, which included $284 million in combined Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) and valuation allowances on its nonperforming loans. Ready Capital also announced it would be reducing its dividend to $0.125 per share. This news caused the price of Ready Capital stock to decline almost 27%, from $6.93 per share at close on February 28, 2025, to $5.07 per share at close on March 3, 2025.

(NASDAQ: TBBK) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Bancorp, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/the-bancorp-inc . Investors have until May 16, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Bancorp stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and is captioned Linden v. The Bancorp, Inc., et al. , No. 25-cv-00326. Why was Bancorp Sued for Securities Fraud? Bancorp is a financial holding company that engages in institutional banking, commercial real estate bridge lending, small business lending and commercial fleet leasing. Its commercial real estate bridge loans (\u201cREBLs\u201d) are primarily collateralized by apartment buildings. The complaint alleges that Bancorp misrepresented the significant risk of default or loss on its REBL loan portfolio and that its credit loss methodology was insufficient to account for the allowance of credit losses. As alleged, Bancorp also misrepresented the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as they contained at least one material weakness. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On March 21, 2024, Culper Research issued a report stating that Bancorp had misrepresented the significant risks of default and/or loss on certain Bancorp REBL loans. According to Culper Research, Bancorp\u2019s REBL loan portfolio is filled with apartments which are \u201cquite literally, crumbling,\u201d with high vacancies and multiple condemnations and that its portfolio consisted of loans to unsophisticated borrowers who were coaxed by \u201cget rich quick\u201d promises. This news caused the price of Bancorp stock to decline over 10%, from $36.04 per share on March 21, 2024, to $32.12 per share on March 21, 2024. On October 24, 2024, Bancorp announced its Q3 2024 results, disclosing net income of only $51.5 million due to \u201ca new CECL [current expected credit losses methodology] factor\u201d to REBL loans which increased credit losses and resulted in a post-tax reduction in net income of $1.5 million. This news caused the price of Bancorp stock to decline over 14%, from $54.96 per share on October 24, 2025, to $47.01 per share on October 25, 2025. Finally, on March 4, 2025, Bancorp disclosed that it had \u201cinappropriately filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024\u201d and informed investors that its financial statements from 2022 to 2024 as reflected in that Annual Report should no longer be relied upon. Bancorp revealed that its auditors did not approve the use of its audit opinions for those years. This news caused the price of Bancorp stock to decline 4.4%, from $53.59 per share on March 4, 2025, to $51.25 per share on March 5, 2025.

The company reported disappointing revenue of $741 million, well below its guidance of \u201cat least\u201d $756 million in revenue.

(NASDAQ: ALDX) for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Aldeyra Therapeutics, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/aldeyra-therapeutics-inc . Why is Aldeyra Therapeutics being Investigated? Aldeyra Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing therapies designed to treat immune-mediated and metabolic diseases. The company\u2019s lead drug candidate, reproxalap, is being developed for the treatment of dry eye disease. During the relevant period, Aldeyra Therapeutics announced the success of its Phase III dry eye chamber clinical trial for reproxalap. The company stated that the trial\u2019s results were \u201cuniquely supportive\u201d of reproxalap\u2019s effect on reducing ocular discomfort and that reproxalap was the first investigational drug with \u201cpivotal data\u201d to support reducing redness. What\u2019s more, the company stated that the trial \u201csatisfies FDA requirements\u201d for New Drug Application resubmission. In truth, Aldeyra Therapeutics\u2019 Phase III trial failed to demonstrate reproxalap\u2019s efficacy in treating ocular symptoms associated with dry eyes. The Phase III trial data suffered from potential methodological issues, including a difference in baseline scores across treatment arms, that did not satisfy the FDA requirements for NDA resubmission. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On April 3, 2025, Aldeyra Therapeutics issued a press release stating that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA for reproxalap. The FDA stated that the NDA \u201cfailed to demonstrate efficacy in adequate and well controlled studies in treating ocular symptoms associated with dry eyes.\u201d The FDA identified concerns with the trial data submitted with the NDA, which the FDA stated may be related to methodological issues, including a difference in baseline scores across treatment arms. This news caused the price of Aldeyra Therapeutics stock to fall nearly 75% over the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $5.33 per share on April 2, 2025.

(NYSE: ATKR) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Atkore, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/atkore-inc . Investors have until April 23, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Atkore stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and is captioned Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy & Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefits Fund v. Atkore Inc., et al. , No. 25-cv-01851. Why was Atkore Sued for Securities Fraud? Atkore manufactures electrical, safety, and infrastructure products including polyvinyl chloride water and electrical conduit pipes (\u201cPVC Pipe\u201d). During the COVID-19 pandemic, shipping costs rose dramatically, leaving foreign PVC Pipe manufacturers unable to profitably sell PVC Pipe in the U.S. As shipping prices returned to normal when the pandemic subsided in 2022, foreign PVC Pipe manufacturers gradually returned to the U.S. market. Shortly thereafter, in late 2022, the price of PVC Pipe began to decline. As alleged, Atkore repeatedly misrepresented that post-pandemic PVC Pipe price declines were the result of \u201cpricing normalization\u201d that reflected \u201ccompetitive dynamics\u201d and assured investors that the Company would continue to successfully compete in the post-COVID-19 market. On July 24, 2024, an activist investor named ManBear published a report titled \u201cPipe Price Fixing\u201d which accused Atkore and three of its competitors of using the commodity pricing service OPIS to coordinate pricing actions and fix the price of PVC Pipe. In truth, it is alleged that Atkore engaged in an anticompetitive price-fixing scheme that artificially inflated the price of PVC Pipes. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On February 4, 2025, Atkore announced disappointing earnings and reduced guidance, disclosing that the \u201cplastic pipe and conduit product category declined mid-single digits during the quarter\u201d compared to \u201chigh single digits in the prior year,\u201d and largely attributed the guidance reduction to Atkore\u2019s PVC Pipe business, stating, \u201croughly $75 million or 3/4 [of the guidance reduction] is on the PVC side.\u201d This news caused the price of Atkore stock to decline nearly 20%, from $79.72 per share on February 3, 2025 to $64.13 per share on February 4, 2025. On February 14, 2025, Atkore disclosed that it received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division seeking the \u201cproduction of documents relating to the pricing of the Company\u2019s PVC pipe and conduit products.\u201d Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/atkore-inc .

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Fluence Energy common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and is captioned Abramov v. Fluence Energy, Inc., et al. , No. 25-cv-00444. Why was Fluence Energy Sued for Securities Fraud? Fluence Energy offers energy storage products and solutions, delivery services, recurring operational and maintenance services, and digital applications and solutions for energy storage and other power assets. As alleged, Fluence Energy misrepresented the strength of its competitive position, sales pipeline, and backlog of orders. In reality, Fluence Energy concealed declines in its sales and earnings growth by engaging in aggressive revenue pull-forwards and selectively applied earnings adjustments. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On February 22, 2024, Blue Orca Capital issued a report revealing that Siemens Energy\u2014an affiliate of one of the company\u2019s founders and largest sources of revenue\u2014filed a lawsuit accusing Fluence Energy of misrepresentations, breach of contract, and fraud. The Blue Orca report also revealed that much of Fluence Energy\u2019s sales and earnings growth was the result of aggressive revenue pull-forwards and selectively applied earnings adjustments. Then, on February 10, 2025, Fluence Energy issued a press release announcing its financial results for Q1 2025. Fluence Energy reported a net loss of $57 million, or $0.32 per share, with revenues falling 49% year-over-year, and lowered its revenue guidance for the remainder of the year. According to Fluence Energy, \u201c[w]e have experienced customer-driven delays in signing certain contracts that, coupled with competitive pressures, result in the need to lower our fiscal year 2025 outlook.\u201d This news caused the price of Fluence Energy stock to decline 46%, to close at $7.00 per share on February 11, 2025.

Upon completion of the merger, BigBear.ai issued $200 million of unsecured convertible notes with a maturity date of December 15, 2026. During the relevant period, BigBear.ai improperly accounted for the 2026 Convertible Notes, causing it to misstate various items in several of the Company\u2019s previously issued financial statements.

On this news, the price of BigBear.ai stock declined roughly 15%, from a closing price of $3.49 per share on March 17, 2025, to $2.97 per share on March 18, 2025. Then, on March 25, 2025, after market, BigBear filed its 2024 10-K restating its consolidated financial statements \u201cto reflect the issuance of the 2026 Notes Conversion Option at fair value as of December 7, 2021 and the subsequent remeasurement to fair value at each reporting date.\u201d The 2024 10-K also disclosed that the Company had identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. On this news, the price of BigBear.ai stock declined roughly 9%, from a closing price of $3.51 per share on March 25, 2025, to $3.19 per share on March 26, 2025.

WASHINGTON \u2014 Despite a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" a return , the Trump administration claims it has no basis for bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

Tesla, the electric vehicle titan, faces a monumental challenge that could reshape its future. A recent ruling mandates the company to replace the 'self-driving' computers in approximately 4 million vehicles or compensate their owners, following admissions that the hardware falls short of promised autonomous capabilities. This development, reported on 14 April 2025, has sent ripples through the automotive world, raising questions about Tesla 's ambitious vision. The Promise of Full Self-Driving Falls Short In 2016, Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, boldly claimed that all vehicles produced henceforth would possess 'all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability'. This promise fuelled dreams of cars transforming into autonomous 'robotaxis', capable of navigating without human intervention. However, in January 2025, Musk conceded that the Hardware 3 (HW3) computers, installed in around 4 million Tesla vehicles globally, lack the processing power for unsupervised autonomy. This admission has sparked outrage among owners who paid premium prices for the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package, expecting a future-proof experience. The shortfall has led to a legal directive, compelling Tesla to act swiftly or face financial repercussions. For context, the FSD package cost owners thousands, with some investing up to \u00a36,300 ($8,000) for software that now requires a hardware upgrade to deliver on its potential. According to Electrek , Musk has pledged to retrofit HW3 vehicles for FSD buyers, but the logistics of such an undertaking are daunting. A Logistical and Financial Quandary Replacing computers in 4 million vehicles is no small feat. Tesla's global fleet spans countless models, from the Model 3 to the Model X, each requiring precise engineering to integrate new hardware. The cost could soar into billions\u2014potentially \u00a37.9 billion ($10 billion) or more, per industry estimates. Compensation, the alternative, poses its own challenges. Determining fair payouts for owners, some of whom purchased FSD years ago, could lead to protracted legal battles and further erode trust in the brand. Tesla's financial position complicates matters. With a market cap of \u00a3197 billion ($250 billion) as of 10 April 2025, the company holds \u00a329 billion ($38 billion) in cash reserves. Yet, recent sales declines\u2014336,681 deliveries in Q1 2025, down 13% year-over-year\u2014signal headwinds that could strain resources needed for this massive retrofit or payout. What Lies Ahead for Tesla Owners? For Tesla owners, the ruling is a double-edged sword. Those who invested in FSD may finally see their vehicles upgraded to match Musk's vision, but scepticism abounds. One owner, quoted in Electrek's report, lamented, 'My car will never be self-driving, and I don't believe Tesla will ever offer a free computer upgrade.' Others hope for cash settlements, though the amount and timeline remain uncertain. The broader implication is a potential shift in how Tesla communicates its technological promises, with p ublications noting that consumer trust hangs in the balance. As Tesla navigates this crisis, the industry watches closely. Will the company deliver on its retrofit pledge, or will compensation become the default path? Either way, this saga underscores the complexities of pioneering autonomous driving in a world that demands accountability. The outcome could redefine Tesla's relationship with its customers, testing the resilience of its brand loyalty. Only time will reveal whether Tesla can turn this setback into a stepping stone for innovation, or if it will remain a cautionary tale in the race to autonomy.

It can\u2019t squander that lead like it did with microchips By Tammy Ma A technician bonding Thermal Mechanical Packages (TMP), fill lines, and diagnostic band windows using adhesive placed on a human hair at the National Ignition Facility in 2010. Joe McNally/Getty Images Fusion energy stands as a beacon of hope in a world beset by rising energy demands, extreme weather and energy security challenges. The same process that powers the sun, fusion would provide abundant, safe, clean and reliable energy . The winner of the fusion race will win a secure energy future for humanity. In fusion , two light nuclei combine to form a single larger one, while converting excess mass into a tremendous amount of energy. The U.S. has led the way in fusion research and development since World War II, when amid a cold war weapons race, scientists first pursued safely harnessing this energy. In 2022 scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) became the first to demonstrate fusion \u201cignition\u201d in a laboratory\u2014 generating more energy out of a fusion reaction than the laser energy fired onto the experiment. This monumental result established the fundamental scientific feasibility of fusion as an energy source. As the only country in the \u201cignition club,\u201d the U.S. must build on this success to assure its leadership in fusion to lead the world\u2019s energy economy into the 22nd century.

Because advances getting us closer to fusion power are now coming, rewarding us for our long investment. The fusion ignition breakthrough relied on the inertial confinement approach to fusion, in which powerful lasers heat and compress small pellets of fusion fuel to extreme temperatures and densities exceeding the center of the sun. Ignition has now been repeated several times since on the NIF, with recent results producing about four times as much energy out than energy in. Another approach to fusion, called magnetic confinement, uses magnetic fields to confine fusion plasmas. Those magnets have recently undergone a quantum leap. In 2021 Commonwealth Fusion Systems built a large, high-temperature superconducting electromagnet that could be ramped up to a field strength of 20 tesla . That\u2019s over 400,000 times stronger than the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, the most powerful ever created for this kind of magnet. These advances have prompted significant venture capital interest, leading to a vibrant fusion start-up culture. With more than $7 billion in global private investment coming in the past 30 years to 45 fusion companies, nearly $1 billion has come in the past year. They are pursuing diverse early-stage fusion approaches including magnets, lasers and a range of combinations in between . True to the nation\u2019s entrepreneurial disposition, most of these companies and investments are U.S.-based. For all the excitement, considerable work remains before fusion energy can plug into the grid . That includes building walls of a power plant that can withstand tens of millions of degrees Celsius; understanding how to extract and recycle tritium for a \u201cclosed loop\u201d of fusion fuel; and designing power plants that are cost-effective at scale. On a fundamental level, to succeed economically, whatever fusion power plant proves out must produce much more energy than it takes to run. These challenges may seem daunting, but innovative solutions are being pursued across the spectrum to the absolute limit that current funding allows. The payoff\u2014complete and permanent energy independence\u2014is too great to ignore. Funding for fusion at today\u2019s levels\u2014approximately $800 million per year of federal funding \u2014is simply not up to the task. A new report from the Special Competitive Studies Project is now calling for $10 billion by 2030 in federal funding to accelerate fusion research and development. That would represent a serious investment and could bring us meaningfully closer to a fusion energy future. Make no mistake, this is a race: China, Japan, the U.K. and European Union member states including Germany are aggressively ramping up investments. The burgeoning fusion sector\u2019s economic impacts will be significant, with the global fusion energy market potentially valued at $1 trillion by 2050 . It is an economic imperative for the U.S. to not only keep pace but lead the world in developing this transformative energy source. In reviewing recent history of technology, the development of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography serves as a compelling analogy\u2014and in some ways, a cautionary tale\u2014for where fusion might be headed. EUV lithography engraves intricate, nanoscopic patterns on silicon wafers with extremely short wavelengths of light. It has been pivotal to extending Moore\u2019s Law , allowing for the doubling of transistors on microchips at a pace of about every two years. That has enabled production of smaller, more powerful and more energy-efficient chips, which impact everything from smartphones to supercomputers to the ongoing AI revolution. EUV lithography grew out of laser-plasma experiments in the inertial fusion program at LLNL in the late 1980s. Its development remains a testament to the collaborative efforts of U.S. scientists, engineers and industry leaders. It also highlights the essential role of sustained public investments in R & D and the ambitious multidisciplinary team science pursued at the national labs in bringing forward truly revolutionary technological changes. Then, alongside national labs and government agencies, major American companies like Intel, Texas Instruments, IBM and AMD also made critical early technology development investments and even stood up a consortium to pool resources. Despite establishing the field and most technologies that enable microchips, the U.S. squandered its hard-won lead by failing to foster the overall ecosystem and invest in domestic production capacity. Leadership was ceded to other nations. A Dutch company ended up with a monopoly on the process, and manufacturers in Asia now dominate global production. The U.S. is now grappling with the national and economic security ramifications of that failure to act at a critical juncture. We are trying to course-correct with legislation to reshore domestic semiconductor manufacturing and rebuild workforce expertise\u2014but it may be too little too late. With fusion, we need to get it right the first time. The fabrication and miniaturization of semiconductors has been called \u201c the greatest engineering challenge of our time .\u201d Likewise, fusion energy , the last known energy source yet to be harnessed, is a grand scientific and engineering challenge. Both EUV and fusion have benefited from decades of U.S. foresight to mature the science and technology, and both are strategic technologies with revolutionary implications for society and the way we live. As we now face an opportunity to make fusion energy a reality, the U.S. has a chance to apply the lessons of EUV lithography and affirm the formidable\u2014albeit tentative\u2014lead it has established in fusion. Taking that lesson to heart means sustaining U.S. dedication and public sector funding to develop foundational technologies; spurring collaboration between government, academia and industry; and coordinating research to promote American energy innovation and drive down costs. By securing an enduring leadership position in fusion technology and exploiting this revolutionary energy source to the fullest, the U.S. can control its energy future while creating high-paying jobs, stimulating economic growth and achieving a singular geopolitical advantage. Funding fusion research will affirm and build on the U.S.\u2019s position as the global leader in energy technology. It held and then lost that role in the semiconductor industry; we cannot afford to make the same mistake twice.

Author of 4 books and 10 global awards, inspiring leaders worldwide. getty Human potential remains one of the greatest untapped resources in history. Despite advanced cognitive abilities, most people harness only a fraction of their brain\u2019s capacity. Icons like Nikola Tesla , who visualized entire machines before building them, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who composed symphonies in his mind before writing a single note, exemplify the extraordinary power of mental imagery. Leaders and celebrities throughout history\u2014like Walt Disney , Albert Einstein , the Wright Brothers , Oprah Winfrey , Jim Carrey and others\u2014have relied on visualization for breakthrough results. Athletes also often rely on visualization; according to the golf legend Jack Nicklaus, \u201cI never hit a shot, not even in practice, without having a very sharp, in-focus picture of it in my head.\u201d But what if this ability wasn\u2019t limited to a select few? What if visualization is the key to unlocking exceptional success for anyone willing to harness it? What if it is the secret power of great leaders? What if visualization could help keep humanity competitive with artificial intelligence (AI)? What Is The V-Factor? Visualization is more than just dreaming\u2014it is a structured cognitive process that transforms aspirations into tangible results. By vividly imagining success, individuals prime their subconscious to pursue that reality. Scientific research confirms that the brain often cannot differentiate between imagined and real experiences , making visualization a powerful tool used by elite athletes, world-class entrepreneurs and top-performing executives. What I call the V-Factor is the intentional application of this principle: using mental imagery to engineer success in business, leadership, personal growth and well-being. The 5 Stages Of Innovation (S.U.P.E.R.) Visualization is not merely about envisioning success\u2014it\u2019s about systematically engineering it. I've identified five critical stages that the V-Factor follows: 1. Stimulate creativity. Exposure to diverse ideas fuels innovation. The more input the brain has, the more it can synthesize groundbreaking solutions. 2. Understand your potential. Self-belief is crucial. Many people fail before they begin simply because they underestimate their own abilities. 3. Practice mindfulness. The subconscious thrives in a focused state. Mindfulness, meditation and breathing exercises sharpen visualization and improve decision-making. 4. Evolve an actionable blueprint. Vision without execution remains a dream. Transform abstract ideas into concrete, strategic steps. 5. Realize your goal. Execution turns visualization into reality. Mentally rehearsing success makes it easier to stay motivated, navigate obstacles and achieve results. Leadership Through Visualization: The Key To Business Success According to Napoleon Hill, \"Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.\" Outstanding leaders do not merely react to change\u2014they expect and shape it. Steve Jobs didn\u2019t just see the present; he foresaw the future and built toward it. Visualization can help leaders simulate success, anticipate risks and develop strategic pathways. In my book The 12 Pillars of Project Excellence , I highlight visualization as a critical component of effective leadership. This approach emphasizes that envisioning success transforms abstract goals into actionable strategies. I've observed five core powers of great leaders: 1. Delegation: Assigning the right tasks to the right people 2. Dynamic Leadership: Inspiring teams and adapting to change 3. Visualization: Seeing the future before it unfolds 4. Lean Thinking: Maximizing efficiency through resource optimization 5. Humility: Remaining grounded and open to continuous learning Among these, visualization fuels every other capability. Without a compelling vision of success, leaders cannot inspire confidence, navigate challenges or drive meaningful change. The V-Factor empowers leaders as follows: Anticipating And Preventing Disasters Proactive leaders don\u2019t just solve problems; they prevent them. Visualization allows leaders to mentally simulate potential failures\u2014financial crises, reputational risks or operational inefficiencies\u2014before they occur, enabling strategic preparation. Visualizing And Implementing Success Strategies Many elite athletes visualize victories before stepping onto the field. Similarly, visionary leaders mentally rehearse successful outcomes before executing major business strategies, aligning decisions and actions with their envisioned success. Identifying Gaps And Driving Financial Turnarounds Strong visualization skills help leaders navigate the customer journey, pinpoint friction points and foresee solutions before they become crises. This foresight leads to better decision-making, improved customer experiences and sustainable financial growth. The V-Factor And The AI Revolution: Staying Ahead As AI evolves at an unprecedented pace, some fear that human capabilities will become obsolete. While AI excels in data processing and pattern recognition, it lacks intuition, creativity, emotional intelligence and visionary thinking\u2014qualities amplified through the V-Factor. Enhancing Human Ingenuity Against AI AI operates on predefined logic, whereas the human mind can visualize the unseen, create original ideas and innovate beyond existing paradigms. Strengthening Decision-Making And Adaptability AI can predict outcomes based on data, but it cannot envision possibilities outside of its programming. Leaders who leverage visualization can mentally simulate future scenarios, anticipate industry shifts and create proactive strategies that AI-driven decision-making cannot match. According to Albert Einstein, \"Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.\" Fostering Emotional Intelligence And Human Connection While AI can process information, it lacks human connection. The V-Factor enhances emotional intelligence by allowing leaders to inspire teams, build strong cultures and thrive on collaboration and empathy. Envisioning The Future Before It Happens AI reacts to data, but visionary leaders shape the future. Those who employ visualization techniques may be able to foresee new markets, emerging trends and groundbreaking technologies before they become mainstream. The Visionary Leader: Turning Thought Into Reality Peter Drucker said, \"The best way to predict the future is to create it.\" Leaders who master the V-Factor don\u2019t just dream of success\u2014they engineer it. Whether preventing setbacks, optimizing operations or driving innovation, visualization is the leadership superpower that turns vision into victory. The ability to see, believe and act upon a compelling vision is what separates great leaders from the rest. The future belongs to those who can envision it before it happens.

By Jeff Jacobs , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Finance Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Apr 15, 2025, 07:30am EDT Share Save Jeff Jacobs is Head of M&A and COO of Investment Banking at Solomon Partners , a leading investment advisory firm founded in 1989. getty Delaware has been the favored home of corporate America for decades. Roughly two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies and 80% of newly public firms incorporate there, drawn by its specialized courts, established case law and governance framework that ensures stability for executives and investors. But cracks are forming in Delaware\u2019s dominance. A wave of high-profile companies\u2014 Tesla , TripAdvisor , The Trade Desk, Dropbox and Meta \u2014have reincorporated or are considering reincorporating elsewhere. This shift is no fluke. It reflects growing legal uncertainty in Delaware, increasing tax burdens and intensifying competition from states such as Texas and Nevada. Delaware lawmakers are scrambling to stem the tide, but the larger question looms: Is this the beginning of the end of the state\u2019s corporate supremacy? The answer carries major implications for chief executives, investors and corporate governance. Why Location Matters Incorporation legally establishes a business as a separate entity, shields owners from personal liability and provides a stable governance structure and long-term continuity. Switching jurisdictions is no trivial matter. It affects governance frameworks, shareholder rights and the legal environment in which boards operate. Investors must assess whether such a move would signal greater executive control, weakened shareholder protection or changes in corporate transparency. Many companies are choosing states with stronger liability protections for directors and controlling shareholders, potentially making shareholder litigation more difficult. This could reshape how investors engage with publicly traded firms and even influence company valuations if markets interpret these shifts as reducing legal oversight. The Tide Turns Delaware has long been favored for its business-friendly laws and over 200 years of corporate case law, which provides a predictable legal environment. Its specialized business courts have reassured boards and investors, particularly in cases involving controlling shareholders. However, several recent Delaware court rulings are challenging long-standing precedents\u2014especially regarding executive liability and shareholder rights. Notably, the Delaware court\u2019s decision to reject Elon Musk\u2019s $55.8 billion Tesla compensation package turned heads throughout corporate America and raised concerns that the state\u2019s legal environment is becoming less predictable. Musk\u2019s response was characteristically swift and direct: He urged companies to exit Delaware altogether. This sentiment is spreading among corporate lawyers, who prioritize legal predictability when advising clients on governance and liability risks. If Delaware courts continue shifting in ways that increase litigation exposure for directors and controlling shareholders, more companies may seek alternatives. Sensing an opportunity, other states are aggressively positioning themselves as alternatives to Delaware. Nevada has become a haven for businesses seeking stronger legal protections for executives. And, unlike Delaware, Nevada has no franchise tax, making it attractive for cost-conscious firms. Artificial intelligence company Gaxos.ai is leaving Delaware for Nevada, citing an estimated $200,000 annual franchise tax bill in Delaware for 2024 versus less than $1,000 in annual fees to incorporate in Nevada. Texas is taking a different approach, setting up a specialized business court system to replicate Delaware\u2019s advantages. By building a judiciary tailored for corporate cases, Texas is positioning itself as a serious contender for incorporation. Delaware Takes Note Delaware lawmakers are not standing still. In response to the corporate departures, the state has passed a sweeping bill (known as Senate Bill 21 )\u2014the most significant overhaul of Delaware corporate law since 1967. The legislation aims to narrow the legal definition of a \u201ccontrolling shareholder,\u201d making it harder for courts to deem executives as having undue influence unless (a) they hold a majority of the voting power or (b) they hold at least 1/3 of the voting power and control management. While the bill is not retroactive, under this new legislation Musk would not have been considered a controlling shareholder in his Tesla compensation case, since he never controlled 1/3 of the vote. The bill also raises the bar for proving director conflicts. It restricts shareholder access to certain internal records, and it also makes it easier for controlling shareholders to avoid \u201centire fairness\u201d review by loosening the requirements for cleansing conflicted transactions. The hope for this new legislation is that it will improve Delaware\u2019s reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction. A More Competitive Environment Despite recent turbulence, Delaware remains the dominant player. Over 2 million legal entities are still incorporated there, and Delaware\u2019s incorporation revenue, the majority of which comes from franchise taxes, accounts for roughly 30% of the state budget. Switching incorporation is a complex, often disruptive process, meaning a large-scale corporate exodus is unlikely in the immediate future. However, the trend of high-profile departures signals a fundamental reevaluation of Delaware\u2019s value proposition. If states such as Texas and Nevada continue refining their corporate laws while Delaware\u2019s legal environment remains in flux, the long-standing status quo may not hold. The decision of where to incorporate is no longer a mere formality; it has become a strategic choice with real financial and legal consequences. Companies must weigh Delaware\u2019s established legal framework against the emerging advantages of competing states. Directors and officers should evaluate whether alternative jurisdictions offer stronger liability protections, lower costs or a more predictable regulatory environment. Investors must monitor how these shifts impact governance structures, shareholder rights and corporate transparency across public firms. Delaware\u2019s dominance in corporate America has long been taken for granted. But as companies rethink their options and alternative jurisdictions gain traction, Delaware\u2019s SB 21 shows its willingness to adapt to ensure it remains the gold standard for corporations.

recent weeks, talks of a Bitcoin crash have echoed through financial markets, with prices dipping sharply from their January 2025 peak of almost $110,000 to below $75,000 by early April. This volatility, however, hasn\u2019t dimmed the fervor for cryptocurrency among Washington\u2019s elite, notably President Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk . Their vocal support underscores crypto\u2019s growing political clout, but it\u2019s the interplay with Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies that raises profound questions about international stability, both geopolitically and geoeconomically. Bitcoin\u2019s allure in Washington stems from its promise of financial sovereignty and its defiance of traditional monetary systems. Trump, styling himself the \u201ccrypto president,\u201d has championed policies like a national Bitcoin stockpile and deregulation to cement America\u2019s dominance in the digital asset space. His inauguration coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s record high, fueled by optimism over his pro-crypto stance. Musk, a key advisor and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has long been a kind of crypto currency evangelist, once boosting Dogecoin\u2019s value with a tweet and now advocating for blockchain\u2019s role in economic innovation. Their enthusiasm signals a shift: cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe asset but a strategic tool in America\u2019s economic arsenal. Yet, this crypto euphoria is colliding head-on with Trump\u2019s tariff blitz. Since April 2025, his administration has slapped sweeping duties\u201410% to 125% (long story short)\u2014on imports from China, Canada, Mexico, and beyond (albeit with pauses), thus triggering global market turmoil. Bitcoin, often pitched as \u201cdigital gold\u201d immune to economic shocks, hasn\u2019t been spared. Prices slid 10% post-tariff announcements, mirroring tech stock sell-offs as investors fled risky assets. Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has plummeted over two-thirds in value in the 11 weeks since Trump\u2019s presidency began. Other major cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Ethereum, and Solana have also crashed, losing over 50% of their value. This challenges the narrative that Bitcoin is a safe haven; as analyst Garrick Hileman notes , it trades more like a volatile tech stock than a stable hedge. One may recall that Michael Saylor (of MicroStrategy, which owns about $33 billion worth of Bitcoin) boasted that \u201cThere are no tariffs on Bitcoin\u201d\u2014only to see Bitcoin reaching its lowest level since November the very next day. Danny Scott, CEO of Britain-based bitcoin exchange CoinCorner, seems to have nailed it: \u201cRecently, Bitcoin has shown a strong correlation with the broader financial markets. As the market declines, Bitcoin has followed, irrespective of its own fundamentals.\u201d The tariffs are indeed a double-edged sword for crypto. On one hand, they amplify economic uncertainty, potentially driving speculative interest toward decentralized assets. If trade wars erode trust in fiat currencies, Bitcoin could gain as a borderless alternative\u2014a view shared by enthusiasts like Michael Saylor, who argues crypto thrives amid \u201chidden risks\u201d like inflation and regulation. On the other hand, tariffs raise costs for crypto infrastructure. I\u2019ve written before on how cryptocurrency mining played a role in Kazakhstan\u2019s 2022 gas prices crisis. More recently, I commented on Musk\u2019s Starlink competition with China\u2019s SpaceSail while Trump\u2019s administration has been pushing fossil fuels for AI, and targeting minerals in Ukraine and Greenland . The hard fact is that AI and crypto mining drive energy and resource demands, thereby aligning with Big Tech and Musk\u2019s influence (also raising power concentration concerns in the US). Trump\u2019s tariffs risk increasing tensions and intensifying global mineral competition, which in turn can lead to plenty of other conflicts worldwide. But here I digress. Mining rigs, reliant on imported chips, face higher prices, squeezing margins for U.S. miners already grappling with energy costs. For instance, Canada, still a Bitcoin mining hub which once had 7% of global hash rate (before declaring \u201cwar\u201d on it in 2023 over environmental concerns, among other things), now faces 25% U.S. tariffs anyway, which could disrupt cross-border supply chains critical to North American crypto dominance. The same applies to other locations, China itself and countries such as Kazakhstan being the other key hubs . Geopolitically, Trump\u2019s tariffs and crypto push are also redrawing alliances. His exclusion of China from a 90-day tariff pause\u2014while hiking duties to 145% \u2014escalates tensions with Beijing, which retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. This trade war risks fragmenting global markets, with crypto caught in the crossfire. China, once a crypto mining powerhouse, could double down on its digital yuan to counter U.S. influence, challenging Bitcoin\u2019s global relevance. Meanwhile, nations like Canada and Mexico, stung by tariffs, may pivot toward crypto-friendly policies to hedge against U.S. economic pressure, potentially fostering rival blockchain hubs. Geoeconomically, the fallout is equally stark. Trump\u2019s tariffs could disrupt supply chains, raising costs for electronics and dampening crypto adoption by discouraging investments in digital assets. A trade war might weaken the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance, prompting speculation that Trump views Bitcoin as a reserve asset to counter volatility, though this risks spurring rival nations to create competing digital currencies, thereby diluting U.S. financial influence. This is yet another way Trump\u2019s policies could backfire. Musk\u2019s role adds another layer of complexity. His public spats with Trump\u2019s trade advisors, like Peter Navarro , reveal tensions over tariffs\u2019 economic toll. Trump\u2019s coalition has always been polarized, with Elon Musk embodying the libertarian, Milei-admiring free-market extreme, while J.D. Vance represents the protectionist, \u201cpro-labor\u201d wing, if you will. This of course creates tension within the Trumpist somewhat contradictory agenda. Musk, whose Tesla relies on global supply chains, has been warning that protectionism could spike prices without delivering jobs. His crypto advocacy, however, aligns well enough with Trump\u2019s vision of \u201cAmerican primacy\u201d, suggesting a delicate balancing act: promote blockchain innovation while navigating tariff-induced chaos. This is not an easy job. Bitcoin\u2019s crash highlights economic uncertainties worsened by Trump\u2019s tariffs, which aim to boost U.S. industry but may raise crypto costs and strain trade ties. This in turn risks a fragmented global financial order, with crypto\u2019s role uncertain, as Trump and Musk\u2019s focus on digital assets faces challenges from their own geopolitical and economic policies. Finally, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown extreme volatility, with the recent crashes highlighting their instability as purely fiduciary assets (in a broader sense, being market-driven, not tied to reserves or bonds). In response, sovereign nations may shift toward digital currencies backed by tangible assets like government bonds or reserves, offering greater stability and trust for economic systems in the near future. As I wrote in 2022, digital currencies too eventually could be further regulated and now would be a good time to start talking about that. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

[...] In one viral video, a woman pressed the pedestrian call button beneath a sign that had been modified to say \u201cBoycott Tesla.\u201d In addition to the standard pedestrian instructions, the speaker played a fake Musk monologue. \u201cYou know it\u2019s funny, I used to think he was just this dumb sack of [expletive],\u201d the voice resembling Musk\u2019s began, apparently referring to President Trump. \u201cBut, well, when you get to know him, he\u2019s actually really sweet and tender and loving.\u201d In the background, a voice resembling Donald Trump\u2019s responded: \u201cSweetie, come back to bed.\u201d Can you help us out?

Jamison Wagner, 40, was charged with allegedly setting fire to a building or vehicle used in interstate commerce. The charge can apply to goods manufactured and sold in different states and the facilities that house them\u2014like the Tesla showroom or the Republican office, which also sells MAGA merchandise. DOJ spokesperson Shannon Shevlin tells WIRED that Wagner\u2019s arrest happened on Saturday. \u201cLet this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,\u201d attorney general Pam Bondi said in the Monday press release. \u201cWe will arrest you, we will prosecute you, and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.\u201d Wagner\u2019s arrest warrant alleges that he is responsible for a February 9 incident at a Tesla showroom in which windows were shattered and two Tesla Model Ys were set on fire. It also alleges that he is responsible for a March 30 incident at the Republican Party of New Mexico office in which the entrance area was set on fire and \u201cICE=KKK\u201d was graffitied on the building\u2019s exterior. The arrest warrant also says that a lead investigator on Wagner\u2019s case is an FBI agent specializing in \u201cinternational terrorism, domestic terrorism and firearms.\u201d This marks the second known time that FBI terrorism investigators have gotten involved in a criminal investigation tied to the recent public backlash against Musk and Tesla. However, it\u2019s the first time that the suspect was also allegedly tied to another incident\u2014which, in this case, targeted a Republican office. The arrest comes amid repeated calls by Bondi, President Trump , Elon Musk , House Speaker Mike Johnson , and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to treat arson and vandalism of Tesla property as \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Five other people are currently facing federal charges for alleged vandalism and arson targeting Tesla property, according to press releases by the DOJ. As reported by WIRED , law enforcement can get access to surveillance technologies and have more legal leeway during terrorism investigations than in other types of investigations. These investigations could also possibly enable Musk and Tesla executives to access surveillance on \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protesters, though the protests have broadly been peaceful, and public-facing protest organizers have said that they don\u2019t endorse property damage. The FBI can decide to share this type of information with the victim of a crime during an investigation, WIRED previously reported. Bondi teased news of Wagner\u2019s arrest last week in a televised Cabinet meeting, telling Trump that there would be \u201canother huge arrest\u201d pertaining to an attack on a Tesla dealership within the next 24 hours. \u201cThat person will be looking at at least 20 years in prison with no negotiations,\u201d Bondi said on Thursday. (The DOJ press release issued after Wagner\u2019s arrest notes, \u201cA complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u201d) DOJ spokesperson Shannon Shevlin confirmed that Wagner's arrest was the announcement Bondi was referring to. Her timeline was off, though, because Wagner was not in custody until Saturday. Wagner was first identified as a suspect due to an unspecified \u201cinvestigative lead developed by law enforcement through scene evidence,\u201d according to the arrest warrant. Investigators claim that after analyzing CCTV footage from buildings near the Republican office and traffic cameras, they identified a car consistent with the one registered to Wagner. After reviewing Wagner\u2019s driver\u2019s license and conducting physical surveillance outside his home, investigators also believed he resembled the person seen on surveillance footage from the Tesla showroom. The arrest warrant claims that upon executing a search warrant at Wagner\u2019s house, investigators found red spray paint, ignitable liquids \"consistent with gasoline,\" and jars consistent with evidence found at both the Tesla showroom fire and the Republican office fire. They also found a paint-stained stencil cutout reading \u201cICE=KKK\u201d consistent with the graffiti found at the Republican office, and clothes that resembled what the suspect was seen wearing on surveillance footage outside the Tesla showroom. According to the arrest warrant, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives forensic laboratory tested \u201cfire debris,\u201d fingerprints, and possible DNA at the scene, but no results are cited in the warrant, which notes that an analysis of the evidence and seized electronic devices is still pending. The five other people currently facing federal charges for allegedly damaging Tesla property include 42-year-old Lucy Grace Nelson of Colorado, 41-year-old Adam Matthew Lansky of Oregon, 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder of South Carolina, 24-year-old Cooper Jo Frederick of Colorado, and 36-year-old Paul Hyon Kim of Nevada. The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force investigated the incident that led to Kim\u2019s indictment on April 9; however, press releases and court filings indicate that the task force was not deployed in the other four investigations.

You've Paid Your Share, But the Billionaires Haven't Shutting down special tax breaks for very wealthy individuals and profitable corporations would go a long way to addressing our nation's deepest problems. Amy Hanauer Apr 15, 2025 Common Dreams Apr 15, 2025 Today our 2024 taxes are due. You likely had most of your federal taxes deducted from your paychecks throughout the year. This is not true, however, for mega-millionaires and billionaires, some of whom are practically running our government right now. They receive much of their income in the form of appreciation on the stocks of the corporations they run. And the companies themselves use loopholes and deductions to reduce their tax bill, sometimes down to zero. Take Tesla (please!). The company, valued at over $1 trillion, paid no federal income tax on its 2024 income of $2.3 billion. And its CEO, Elon Musk , who had hoarded some $342 billion in wealth by earlier this year, avoids paying taxes on most of his income until he chooses to \u201crealize\u201d capital gains by selling his enormously appreciated stock. Because of our overall low taxes, the U.S. does not collect as much revenue as other comparable nations. This means you get a lot less by being an American citizen than you get by being a French, German or Swedish citizen. Less health care , less child care , less access to affordable college . These low taxes are part of the reason that America experiences supercharged inequality . While other countries do more to boost people at the bottom and enable upward mobility for the middle class, in the U.S. low taxes combined with an anti-worker, anti-consumer, anti-environment regulatory regime means that here the rich get richer and the rest of us stagnate. A regime of relatively robust taxation and reasonable regulation delivered a more educated, healthier, more prosperous America. Further, the extreme wealth of the billionaire class often lets them buy the elected officials and the policies they want\u2014usually policies that add further to their riches in a vicious cycle that leaves most of us worse off. President Trump has given Musk the power to fire tens of thousands of workers, eliminate funding for hospitals and universities around the country, and destroy Congressionally-created agencies that carry out vital public functions. Shutting down special tax breaks for very wealthy individuals and profitable corporations could go a long way to addressing these problems. But Trump and his allies in Congress are moving dramatically in the opposite direction. While they plan to double down on tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy, they are also allowing the most destructive billionaire-driven attack we\u2019ve ever seen on the policies that keep us healthy and safe. Musk is wielding a chainsaw against public services using his so-called DOGE (\u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d though it\u2019s not a government agency and will likely undermine efficiency). DOGE\u2019s cuts to services could decimate education, health, and income support. And its cuts to public oversight will enable corporations to more easily exploit us as workers, consumers, and community members. For example, Trump and Musk are trying to eliminate the Department of Education and slash school budgets in ways that will particularly harm children with disabilities, students in disadvantaged rural and urban schools, and college access for working class kids . They\u2019ve fired 10,000 staff members at the Department of Health and Human Services, including those who ensure vaccine distribution, drug safety, and health care access. They\u2019ve haphazardly slashed funding nationwide for labs conducting medical research on cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, maternal health, and more. They tried to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency which has recovered more than $21 billion for consumers from companies that engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. And they even slashed the Federal Emergency Management Association which helps communities facing floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, leaving communities unprotected . Their reasons are three-fold, all bad for regular people: Cutting public services can free policymakers to pass expensive tax cuts for the wealthiest people and corporations. It can also allow privatization of services so Musk and others can demand payment to provide them. Finally by hobbling regulations and firing public employees that safeguard factories , inspect meat, and test drugs , Musk hopes to juice corporate profits as CEOs are permitted to shed factory safety equipment, ignore anti-pollution rules , and violate labor laws . This doesn\u2019t even begin to touch on the crazy on-again, off-again tariffs that are roiling our financial markets and industrial supply chains. Policymakers of the 20th century created regulations, safety nets, and labor standards that made Americans more educated, more prosperous, and healthier. They didn\u2019t work perfectly of course. But education, income, and health improved dramatically over this span. Educational investments boosted high school attainment rates for adults from a mere 10 percent in 1910 to 90 percent by 2017 . With more education and unionization, inflation-adjusted per capita income went from $18,460 in 1967 to $46,193 by 2023. Research and vaccination nearly eradicated polio, smallpox, and measles. And safety standards meant the number of workers killed on the job plummeted from 15.8 to 1.9 per 100,000 between 1928 (when tracking began) and 1998. The big picture: life expectancy at birth nearly doubled (from 46.6 years to 74.7 years) for white men and more than doubled (from 32.5 years to 68.2 years) for Black men between 1900 and the year 2000. In other words, a regime of relatively robust taxation and reasonable regulation delivered a more educated, healthier, more prosperous America. In 2025, it seems, Trump and those he enables are trying to make American impoverished again by rolling back the 20th century and its accomplishments. An Unconstitutional Rampage Trump and Musk are on an unconstitutional rampage, aiming for virtually every corner of the federal government. These two right-wing billionaires are targeting nurses, scientists, teachers, daycare providers, judges, veterans, air traffic controllers, and nuclear safety inspectors. No one is safe. The food stamps program, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are next. It\u2019s an unprecedented disaster and a five-alarm fire, but there will be a reckoning. The people did not vote for this. The American people do not want this dystopian hellscape that hides behind claims of \u201cefficiency.\u201d Still, in reality, it is all a giveaway to corporate interests and the libertarian dreams of far-right oligarchs like Musk. Common Dreams is playing a vital role by reporting day and night on this orgy of corruption and greed, as well as what everyday people can do to organize and fight back.

You likely had most of your federal taxes deducted from your paychecks throughout the year. This is not true, however, for mega-millionaires and billionaires, some of whom are practically running our government right now. They receive much of their income in the form of appreciation on the stocks of the corporations they run. And the companies themselves use loopholes and deductions to reduce their tax bill, sometimes down to zero. Take Tesla (please!). The company, valued at over $1 trillion, paid no federal income tax on its 2024 income of $2.3 billion. And its CEO, Elon Musk , who had hoarded some $342 billion in wealth by earlier this year, avoids paying taxes on most of his income until he chooses to \u201crealize\u201d capital gains by selling his enormously appreciated stock. Because of our overall low taxes, the U.S. does not collect as much revenue as other comparable nations. This means you get a lot less by being an American citizen than you get by being a French, German or Swedish citizen. Less health care , less child care , less access to affordable college . These low taxes are part of the reason that America experiences supercharged inequality . While other countries do more to boost people at the bottom and enable upward mobility for the middle class, in the U.S. low taxes combined with an anti-worker, anti-consumer, anti-environment regulatory regime means that here the rich get richer and the rest of us stagnate. A regime of relatively robust taxation and reasonable regulation delivered a more educated, healthier, more prosperous America. Further, the extreme wealth of the billionaire class often lets them buy the elected officials and the policies they want\u2014usually policies that add further to their riches in a vicious cycle that leaves most of us worse off. President Trump has given Musk the power to fire tens of thousands of workers, eliminate funding for hospitals and universities around the country, and destroy Congressionally-created agencies that carry out vital public functions. Shutting down special tax breaks for very wealthy individuals and profitable corporations could go a long way to addressing these problems. But Trump and his allies in Congress are moving dramatically in the opposite direction. While they plan to double down on tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy, they are also allowing the most destructive billionaire-driven attack we\u2019ve ever seen on the policies that keep us healthy and safe. Musk is wielding a chainsaw against public services using his so-called DOGE (\u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d though it\u2019s not a government agency and will likely undermine efficiency). DOGE\u2019s cuts to services could decimate education, health, and income support. And its cuts to public oversight will enable corporations to more easily exploit us as workers, consumers, and community members. For example, Trump and Musk are trying to eliminate the Department of Education and slash school budgets in ways that will particularly harm children with disabilities, students in disadvantaged rural and urban schools, and college access for working class kids . They\u2019ve fired 10,000 staff members at the Department of Health and Human Services, including those who ensure vaccine distribution, drug safety, and health care access. They\u2019ve haphazardly slashed funding nationwide for labs conducting medical research on cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, maternal health, and more. They tried to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency which has recovered more than $21 billion for consumers from companies that engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. And they even slashed the Federal Emergency Management Association which helps communities facing floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, leaving communities unprotected . Their reasons are three-fold, all bad for regular people: Cutting public services can free policymakers to pass expensive tax cuts for the wealthiest people and corporations. It can also allow privatization of services so Musk and others can demand payment to provide them. Finally by hobbling regulations and firing public employees that safeguard factories , inspect meat, and test drugs , Musk hopes to juice corporate profits as CEOs are permitted to shed factory safety equipment, ignore anti-pollution rules , and violate labor laws . This doesn\u2019t even begin to touch on the crazy on-again, off-again tariffs that are roiling our financial markets and industrial supply chains. Policymakers of the 20th century created regulations, safety nets, and labor standards that made Americans more educated, more prosperous, and healthier. They didn\u2019t work perfectly of course. But education, income, and health improved dramatically over this span. Educational investments boosted high school attainment rates for adults from a mere 10 percent in 1910 to 90 percent by 2017 . With more education and unionization, inflation-adjusted per capita income went from $18,460 in 1967 to $46,193 by 2023. Research and vaccination nearly eradicated polio, smallpox, and measles. And safety standards meant the number of workers killed on the job plummeted from 15.8 to 1.9 per 100,000 between 1928 (when tracking began) and 1998. The big picture: life expectancy at birth nearly doubled (from 46.6 years to 74.7 years) for white men and more than doubled (from 32.5 years to 68.2 years) for Black men between 1900 and the year 2000. In other words, a regime of relatively robust taxation and reasonable regulation delivered a more educated, healthier, more prosperous America. In 2025, it seems, Trump and those he enables are trying to make American impoverished again by rolling back the 20th century and its accomplishments.

Morning Rundown: Trump\u2019s immigration pressure campaign, Biden hits back in post-presidency speech, and Gene Hackman investigation findings Skip to Content A vehicle damaged in a fire at the Tesla showroom in Albuquerque, N.M., on Feb. 9. U.S. Attorney's Office By Patrick Smith A man has been federally charged with carrying out arson attacks against the Republican Party headquarters in New Mexico and a Tesla dealership, the Justice Department said Monday. Jamison Wagner, of Albuquerque and born in 1984, faces two counts of causing malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives. He is in police custody and faces a detention hearing Wednesday. If he is convicted, Wagner faces five to 20 years in prison on each count. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that authorities would not tolerate \"this ongoing wave of political violence,\" referring to repeated attacks on Tesla vehicles , dealerships and chargers in recent weeks. Tesla has become the target of peaceful protests and violent attacks after its CEO, Elon Musk, became a key figure in President Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle and shrink federal agencies. \"Hurling firebombs is not political protest,\" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in the statement. \"The impressive work by law enforcement in New Mexico sends a clear message to perpetrators of all of the shameful attacks on Tesla facilities and political establishments: we are coming for you, you can\u2019t hide, and you will do serious jail time to pay for your crimes.\" A court document dated Saturday and filed in New Mexico District Court shows that Wagner is accused of two separate arson offenses in Albuquerque: one at a Tesla showroom on Feb. 9 and another at the GOP offices on March 30. Two Model Y Teslas were damaged in the first incident, prosecutors say, in an attack at 3:13 a.m. Graffiti were found at the scene, including \"Die Elon,\" \"Tesla Nazi Inc\" and \"Die Tesla Nazi.\" Some of the letters were replaced with swastikas. Graffiti at a Tesla dealership in Albuquerque, N.M. U.S. Attorney's Office Investigators said that the car fires were set intentionally and that an incendiary device was found at the scene. Security video showed a man prosecutors believe is Wagner exiting a light-colored sedan car around the time of the fire, wearing all-black clothing and carrying a white box, the court document said. \"A small flickering light, consistent with a transient ignition source, was observed in the subject\u2019s hands before flame rapidly appeared inside one vehicle,\" the court document said. \"The subject left the area rapidly after the fire started inside one vehicle.\" Prosecutors say that the second attack took place at the Republican Party of New Mexico office at 5:55 a.m., and that the front door and the lobby were damaged. The message \"ICE=KKK\" was sprayed onto a wall. Shards of glass incendiary devices were found similar to those found at the Tesla dealership, the document said. Fire damage at the Republican Party of New Mexico headquarters. U.S. Attorney's Office On Friday, the FBI obtained a warrant and searched Wagner's home, where they found eight suspected incendiary devices \u2014 some with the same handwritten \"I\" and \"H\" written on the lids \u2014 materials for making them, spray paint and a stencil bearing the letters \"ICE=KKK,\" and a black hoodie with red paint on it, the court document said.

Follow Author Apr 15, 2025, 06:28am EDT Share Save Comment Apprentice engineer programming and working with robots in a car factory getty The Rise of AI-Powered Robotics, and the Future of Work While ChatGPT and generative AI dominate headlines, a quieter revolution is unfolding in AI-powered robotics, transforming businesses and reshaping industries. Far from science fiction, these intelligent machines are automating tasks, boosting efficiency, and sparking debates about their impact on jobs. AI robots fuse artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, with physical hardware to execute tasks autonomously or alongside humans. Unlike traditional robots limited to rigid, pre-programmed routines, AI robots adapt to unpredictable environments, learning from data to navigate challenges. Imagine a warehouse bot weaving through clutter, a retail robot answering customer queries, or a humanoid assembling intricate parts. These machines blend cognitive power with physical precision. Their rise reflects businesses\u2019 need to boost efficiency, enhance safety, and meet surging demands, particularly in e-commerce and industrial sectors. AI robots combine artificial intelligence with physical hardware to perform tasks autonomously or collaboratively with humans. Unlike traditional robots programmed for repetitive actions, AI robots leverage machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing to adapt, learn, and navigate complex environments. The global robotics market is surging, driven by AI advancements, labor shortages, and the push for automation. Estimates place the market at $53.2 billion in 2024, with projections ranging from $74 billion to over $90 billion by 2026, and as high as $178.7 billion by 2033. Businesses are adopting these robots to cut costs, improve safety, and meet rising consumer demands, especially in e-commerce, manufacturing, and logistics.

Boston Dynamics is known for its agile robots like Spot and Atlas. Boston Dynamics blends AI with advanced mobility. Spot inspects hazardous sites, while Atlas showcases humanoid capabilities, hinting at future factory roles. A Japanese giant, Fanuc dominates industrial robotics with AI-driven robotic arms for manufacturing. Its machines excel in precision tasks like welding and assembly, used by automakers like Toyota. ABB , the Swiss-Swedish firm, specializes in industrial robots for factories , integrating AI to enhance flexibility. ABB\u2019s robots handle everything from packaging to electronics assembly, serving clients like Siemens. Agility Robotics is a rising star. Agility\u2019s bipedal robot Digit navigates human-designed spaces, making it ideal for warehouses. Backed by Amazon, Digit is being tested for tasks like moving storage bins. Amazon leads in warehouse automation, deploying over 750,000 robots across its fulfillment centers. Its AI-powered bots, like Proteus and Sparrow, streamline picking and sorting, setting industry benchmarks. Beyond cars, Tesla is developing Optimus, a humanoid robot aimed at factory work and potentially broader applications. Still in early stages, Optimus reflects Elon Musk\u2019s bet on AI-driven automation. NVIDIA, while not a robot maker, NVIDIA\u2019s AI platforms, like Isaac, power robotic brains , enabling developers to build smarter machines. Its tech underpins many robotics startups.These players, alongside startups like Covariant and Universal Robots, are pushing boundaries, with Asia (Japan, China) and the U.S. leading innovation hubs. AI Robots at Amazon and Warehouses Amazon\u2019s warehouses offer a front-row seat to AI robotics in action. The company\u2019s 750,000 robots \u2014up from 200,000 in 2019\u2014include Sparrow, which picks individual items, and Cardinal, which stacks packages. Proteus, an autonomous cart-mover, navigates freely among workers, while Digit, a humanoid, is being tested for bin handling. These bots, powered by computer vision and machine learning, have slashed delivery times and boosted efficiency, with Morgan Stanley estimating $10 billion in annual savings by 2030. Amazon employs 1.5 million people, down from 1.6 million in 2021, as its robot fleet grows. Critics point to this as evidence of displacement, with repetitive roles like picking and packing most at risk. A 2019 study found each industrial robot replaces about three manufacturing workers on average. Yet Amazon insists robots create jobs, citing 700 new job categories, like robotics maintenance and programming, which didn\u2019t exist a decade ago. Injury rates are also lower at robotic sites, as bots handle heavy lifting. Will Robots Take Jobs? The job question isn\u2019t black-and-white. AI robots can displace workers in repetitive roles such as warehouse pickers, and assembly line operators, but they also spark demand for new skills. MIT research shows companies adopting robots often grow, hiring more workers overall, while those that don\u2019t automate lose ground and cut jobs. Amazon\u2019s upskilling programs, training 300,000 workers since 2020, aim to shift employees to technical roles like robot oversight, which pay better but require retraining. The challenge is that not everyone adapts easily. Older workers or those in rural areas with limited training access face bigger hurdles. Automation also risks widening inequality if gains concentrate among high-skill workers. On the flip side, robots address labor shortages, especially in aging economies like Japan, and enhance safety by reducing strains, and back injuries drop when bots lift heavy loads. History offers perspective. For example, the Industrial Revolution killed some jobs but created others. Today\u2019s warehouse worker might become tomorrow\u2019s robot technician, but the transition demands support, education, reskilling, and policies to share automation\u2019s benefits broadly. For workers, the future hinges on adaptation. Jobs will evolve , some vanishing, others emerging. Governments and companies must invest in training to ease the shift, ensuring robotics doesn\u2019t just boost profits but lifts people too. At its best, AI robotics frees humans from drudgery, letting us focus on creativity and problem-solving. At its worst, it could deepen divides without careful planning. The robots are here, and they\u2019re getting smarter. Embrace the change, learn the tools, and you\u2019ll find opportunities. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

He manages a $137 million portfolio that includes holdings in companies like Tesla and Apple . \"I think it's too soon to tell if the tariffs will lead the world into a recession,\" Tsai said. \"It primarily depends upon how long and to what extent the tariffs remain in place.\" On April 2, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs for over 180 countries on what he called \" Liberation Day .\" A baseline rate of 10% went into effect on April 5. A higher set of tariff rates that varied by country took effect on Wednesday before Trump announced a 90-day pause on the same day. The pause, however, does not apply to China. Trump had already imposed a 20% tariff on China last month. He initially announced a 34% reciprocal tariff on China on April 2 before hiking it up to 145% last week. China has retaliated with a 125% tariff on US imports . \"I don't agree with the approach of starting an all-out economic war, but I do give him credit for following through on the threat of tariffs,\" Tsai said of Trump's recent tariff announcements. Tariffs have long been a fixation of Trump's. Besides waging a trade war with China in his first term, Trump often talked about placing tariffs on foreign countries and companies while on the campaign trail last year. \"By doing so, Trump showed the world he was not bluffing and that he was willing to inflict some degree of domestic pain in order to demonstrate how serious the impact of the tariff would be on other countries,\" Tsai said, adding that countries like Japan and South Korea are now eager to start negotiating with the US. Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said almost 70 countries had approached the Trump administration on starting trade talks. \"Trump's use of credible threats and a tit-for-tat retaliation on China is consistent with game theory. A back-and-forth negotiating style might appear inconsistent, but is not necessarily inconsistent with a strong position,\" Tsai said. Businesses won't have enough time to adjust even with a 90-day pause on tariffs Tsai told BI that he was more concerned about Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs and whether it will be extended. \"I think that Trump is fully aware of the difficulties companies will have if they are not given enough time to adjust their operations to a new cost structure, and that's why he has paused some reciprocal tariffs and exempted certain goods,\" Tsai said. \"It's unclear, and intentionally unclear, whether 90 days will wind up being 180 days. But I want to stress that, unfortunately for many businesses, that's just not enough time to adjust,\" Tsai added. Tsai said he had spoken to several business owners. Some told him that they are adopting a wait-and-see approach to their investments, while others are proactively shifting their supply chains to other countries. The impact of Trump's tariffs on small and medium-sized businesses that aren't able to adjust could be what tips the US into recession, Tsai said. Small and medium-sized businesses represent about 44% of America's GDP, per the US Chamber of Commerce. \"This is a lot more than numbers. People's jobs are at stake and businesses that have been thriving and contributing to the economy for years are all of a sudden in an extremely different situation. That's worrisome to me,\" Tsai said. Tesla is in an 'even better position' after Trump's tariffs news Trump's tariffs have drawn criticism from business leaders and experts, including one of Trump's biggest backers, Elon Musk . Musk recently called for a \" zero-tariff situation \" and a \"free trade zone\" between the US and Europe. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro . Musk said Navarro was \" dumber than a sack of bricks \" after he called Musk a \"car assembler.\" But Tsai believes Tesla is in an \"even better position\" than before Trump's tariff announcement. \"We think that tariffs are a relative positive for Tesla as Tesla vehicles become relatively cheaper than competing vehicles. That's because Tesla has a 100% US production footprint, and almost all of its component parts come from within the United States,\" Tsai said. Tesla shares make up a large part of Tsai's portfolio. In an SEC filing on February 12, Tsai Capital said it owned 69,700 shares, or about one-fifth of its portfolio. Tesla shares have slid by nearly 50% from their record highs. The automaker's shares closed at about $252 on Monday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in mid-December. The company initially enjoyed a postelection boost after Trump's November election victory, but it has since seen a drop in sales in Europe and China. Musk's work with the White House DOGE office has also hurt Tesla, as the company's showrooms and vehicles have become targets for protesters and vandals . Tsai told BI last month that Tsai Capital had started buying Tesla stock again. He said Musk's involvement with the US government was a \"significantly positive event\" for Tesla and \"negative market sentiment will disappear at some point.\" \"There's always been issues with any company, including Tesla. The way we look at it is that Tesla has a very small share of a growing pie that will eventually result in a pie almost entirely composed of electric vehicles,\" Tsai said on Monday. \"So we don't get too caught up with what might be happening in any given month and miss the forest for the trees,\" he added.

US battery electric vehicle (BEV) manufacturer, Tesla Inc, has launched sales operations in oil-rich Saudi Arabia, taking on existing zero-emission brands such as US manufacturer Lucid and China\u2019s BYD in a market dominated by large petrol-driven SUVs. The US automaker has opened sales outlets in the cities of Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam, as it looks to emulate the relative success it has enjoyed in neighbouring markets such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the company is appealing to a small but growing number of urban buyers.

Find out more The launch comes as Tesla sales in a large number of markets worldwide have fallen in recent months, which has been partly blamed on the company\u2019s owner Elon Musk\u2019s close allegiance with newly-elected US President Donald Trump. The company\u2019s global sales fell by 13% year-on-year to 336,681 units in the first quarter of 2025, including a 9% drop in US sales to 128,100 units. The company\u2019s share price has almost halved since Donald Trump won the US Presidential election in November. Naseem Akbarzada, Tesla country manager for Saudi Arabia, told reporters this week: \u201cToday we are proud to officially launch in the kingdom, marking the start of a long-term presence in the country.\u201d Tesla plans to build a network of charging stations for its customers, starting in the three cities where it has opened sales outlets. But recharging facilities on the country\u2019s desert inter-city highways remains limited. Saudi economist Mohammed Al-Qahtani welcomed Tesla entry into the market, but urged the company to invest more in the country, saying \u201cwe do not want a showroom, we want a factory.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : In a recent interview, Trump boasted about how he helped Apple with tariff pivots. Trump specifically names Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook, suggesting a relationship that\u2019s closer than we thought. At the moment, it is still unclear what the final picture will look like regarding US companies paying tariffs on goods imported from China. While the current rates are sitting at 145%, Trump made some statements and decisions that have left us more confused than ever. For instance, after announcing the tariffs, he announced he would exempt smartphones and computers from them . Later, the Trump administration clarified that these tariff exemptions are temporary . Now in his latest interview, Trump boasted on how he had apparently \u201chelped\u201d Apple with these tariff pivots. Giving Apple a helping hand During the interview, Trump discussed the automotive industry and how he is looking to help. He was also asked about smartphones, specifically Apple products. According to Trump , \u201cLook, I\u2019m a very flexible person. I don\u2019t change my mind, but I\u2019m flexible. And you have to be. You just can\u2019t have a wall, and you\u2019ll only go\u2014no, sometimes you have to go around it, under it, or above it. There\u2019ll be maybe things coming up. I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook recently. And that whole business\u2014I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we\u2019re going to the position of greatness for our country.\u201d As 9to5Mac points out, Trump\u2019s specifically naming Coo suggests how his administration favors Apple . It also suggests that Trump speaks to Cook about economic matters. This is a good thing for the company if it hopes to escape the tariffs or pay a lower amount than others. Apple and Tesla exemptions It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard about Apple potentially getting exemptions. In December 2024, before Trump took office, reports claimed that Apple and Tesla might avoid paying these tariffs . This is because Trump is looking to put American businesses first. Allowing American companies such as Tesla and Apple to avoid these tariffs will give them an advantage over their rivals such as BYD and Samsung. That said, Trump\u2019s implementation of tariffs isn\u2019t going to be easy. US-based small businesses have already filed lawsuits. Countries like China are increasing their own tariffs on goods imported from the US.

GM and other major carmakers launched an electric offensive in the US, cutting Tesla's market share. In Europe, Tesla is dealing with increased competition from BMW and VW as well as Chinese EVs. Tesla is losing ground at home and globally as its sales continue a downward slide, ceding market share to automakers that have flooded the zone with new models in recent years. General Motors, Ford, and Volkswagen were some of the biggest winners in the US in the first quarter of 2025, during which the EV market grew by 11% to nearly 300,000 cars sold, according to first-quarter data from Cox Automotive. In Europe, homegrown automakers such as BMW and VW have seen their electric vehicle businesses skyrocket, while Chinese brands like BYD and Geely have also made a major push into the continent. General Motors and other big automakers push back in the US A 2026 Cadillac Vistiq electric SUV. Cadillac Tesla sold 128,100 vehicles in the United States during the first quarter of the year, down 8.6% from the same time last year and a whopping 21% decline compared with 2023, Cox said. Despite seeing its share of the US EV market fall from 51% to 44% over the past year, per the Cox data, Tesla remains the biggest player by a wide margin. But a group of traditional automakers, led by Ford and GM, has been staging an offensive against Tesla for years. GM has launched roughly a dozen Cadillac-, Chevrolet-, and GMC-branded EVs over the past year, ranging from the $34,000 compact Chevy Equinox SUV to the $300,000-plus ultraluxurious Cadillac Celestiq sedan . They've helped it gain an 11% market share after sales grew 94% year over year in the first quarter, according to Cox. When you include Honda and Acura, which entered the EV market last spring with a pair of GM-made SUVs, General Motors and its partners now hold 16% of the market, Cox said. A 2024 Honda Prologue Elite electric SUV made by General Motors. Honda Elsewhere, VW is up 55%, BMW is up 26%, Nissan is up 23%, and Ford, which owns about 8% of the segment, saw a 12% sales increase. Other big winners include VW, with sales up 55% year over year; BMW, up 26%; Nissan, up 23%; and Ford, which owns about 8% of the segment and saw a 12% sales increase, Cox said. Lower-volume players in the EV space also saw explosive growth. Porsche, Toyota, Subaru, and Volvo sales were up 250%, 196%, 173%, and 173%, respectively, year-over-year, Cox said.

During the first two months of 2025, the automaker's sales collapsed nearly 43% from the same period last year, according to industry data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association amid a growing backlash against CEO Elon Musk and his endorsement of the German far-right party Alternative for Germany. Tesla's fall comes despite overall European electric car sales growing by nearly 30% over the same period, a European Automobile Manufacturers' Association data analysis found \u2014 and some of Tesla's German rivals appear to have benefited from its brand implosion. The new Volkswagen ID Buzz EV minivan. Volkswagen Volkswagen said last week it had more than doubled its EV sales in Europe in the first quarter, while the luxury brand BMW reported a 64% rise in sales of fully electric vehicles. That poses a big problem for Tesla in the company's third-biggest market, where it sold about 327,000 electric cars last year \u2014 and it could be about to get a lot worse. The Chinese automakers BYD, Xpeng, and Geely are expanding aggressively in Europe. While their market share is still tiny, early data suggests that BYD is beginning to eat into Tesla's sales. BYD outsold Tesla in Italy and Spain in the first quarter of 2025 and closed the gap on its rival in the UK and Germany, according to data compiled by the market research firm Argus Media. They recorded huge surges in sales even as Tesla's market share plunged . The Warren Buffett-backed Chinese EV giant exported a record number of cars in the first quarter as it took its fight against Tesla global. Polestar, Geely's Swedish EV brand, reported a 76% increase in global sales during the first quarter of this year.

He is the chairman of the board of management of Mercedes\u2011AMG, the performance arm of the company, and head of Mercedes\u2011Benz G\u2011Class and Mercedes\u2011Maybach business units, its super-luxury brand. This list is reflective of the 41-year-old's ambition to drive significant change for the betterment of each of the company's properties that he touches. At a young age he, \"fell in love with Mercedes,\" Schiebe told Newsweek , saying that the W211 E-Class is the model he swooned over the most. Following his mandatory German military service, Schiebe secured a spot in Mercedes' university program, which allowed him to earn a degree in economics while studying for a future with the automaker, working in different departments and building a network within the company. He said: \"I had the opportunity to learn what I like and what I don't like. It was clear that procurement was not [going to be] my profession. But I was always into technology and cars. As a small boy, I was amazed by AMG cars. I studied economics but since I was always the technology guy, when I had to write my diploma thesis, I contacted one of the senior research and development managers and asked him if I could write about his department.\" In the run-up to the F1\u2122 Grand Prix in Monaco, Michael Shiebe, Chairman of the Board of Management of Mercedes -AMG and Head of Mercedez-Benz G - Class & Mercedes \u2013 Maybach Units, is presenting...

More Mercedes-Benz AG The more he learned, the more he was intrigued. By the time he submitted his thesis, the manager had offered Schiebe a job on his team. He worked there for two years, hands-on in the early stage of product development. \"I like innovations. I like future technologies. At that time, the engineering department wanted workers to be a part of one vehicle development life cycle before they could become a manager. For me, that was a little bit too slow,\" he said.

He became a project manager for a new Mercedes cost-saving program focused on capital and revenue optimization, a move he said set him up for future roles because he got an overview of the financials and learned how all the departments worked together. After the financial crisis, Mercedes began investing in electric vehicle development, and Schiebe changed jobs again. \"No one was really interested, to be very honest, in electric cars,\" he said. The department was small, with only two vehicles in its portfolio, the Smart Electric Drive and the Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive, which was done in partnership with Tesla .\" Mercedes-AMG CEO Michael Schiebe and F1\u2122 driver Lewis Hamilton at the world premiere of the new Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E PERFORMANCE Mercedes-AMG CEO Michael Schiebe and F1\u2122 driver Lewis Hamilton at the world premiere of the new Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E PERFORMANCE Mercedes-Benz AG In that small, scrappy department, he had the ability to grow, cross-managing many efforts working in product management. Three years later, Ola K\u00e4llenius , then the Mercedes board of management member for marketing and sales, was seeking a new chief of staff. Schiebe put in an application and was invited to interview for the position. Though it was scheduled on a Friday for 30 minutes, the interview was over in eight. Schiebe said: \"I said to myself, 'Was I really that bad?' because he asked me a few questions and said, 'We will have a look at some other candidates and then we're gonna call you.'\" Half an hour later, K\u00e4llenius' assistant called Schiebe and said, \"You're starting on Monday.\" Schiebe worked for K\u00e4llenius for two years in that role. During that time, K\u00e4llenius explained to him that if he wanted a further sales and marketing career, he needed to go abroad and get experience. Schiebe was sent to Luxembourg, becoming the head of Mercedes business there. \"That was one of the most exciting positions I have had in my career. Luxembourg was the only country where we had a wholesale organization together with a retail organization,\" he said. \"I was then, at the age of 32, the CEO of this little company.\" He oversaw the company's efforts selling passenger cars, trucks, vans and buses in the country. Schiebe's office was on the first floor of a showroom. Continuous discussions with salesmen allowed him to learn more about retail operations. \"I want[ed] to understand firsthand, what is working well, what's not. How do you do an offer? How do we work with your customers?\" he said. Two years later, Schiebe moved to Sweden to run a new Mercedes direct sales initiative, Retail of the Future. After eight months he was transferred to Berlin as head of sales and marketing for the German market. Then he got a call. \"'Michael, I took over as the CEO of the company and I need to have a chief who knows me.' So then I joined Ola again,\" Schiebe said.

Mercedes-Benz AG Schiebe spent two more years by K\u00e4llenius' side, absorbing as much as he could along the way. The AMG head said: \"I was then part of all the board meetings, because my team was organizing all the board and supervisory board meetings. So, I got the full picture. And again, was very close to product, because Ola is a product guy like I am, and so he loves to talk about technology. Then, I got the greatest opportunity of my career, my current job. And I just love my current job.\" Schiebe's passion for the AMG product is key to this love. \"I really, really love AMG and the team here. I think I work best when I have a team around me that is also passionate about what they do. At AMG, 65 percent of my team is engineers, and they have this passion and always come up with creative ideas, and they have the motivation to really beat the competition,\" he said. \"This is what motivates me.\" K\u00e4llenius, chairman of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz Group and 2024 Visionary Disruptor of the Year , told Newsweek : \"If there's anyone who can take the wheel and steer AMG toward even greater success, it's him. Michael dares to make bold decisions without compromising AMG's core values\u2014safeguarding the brand that makes customers' hearts race faster.\" After two years at AMG's helm, Schiebe's vision will begin to come to life publicly in 2026. \"Next year we will start, I would say, the biggest product offensive AMG has seen in the last decade. This is why I'm working day and night, because I can't wait until these cars hit the road,\" he said. The brand head describes future product as \"bolder and more emotional\" than current and past AMG models, and they will be a mix of battery-electric and internal combustion engine vehicles. He also teased, \"We will be conquering new positions and new segments that we haven't entered so far.\" Schiebe's big plans for AMG stretch beyond its traditional model, design and technology boundaries, and are what has positioned him as Newsweek 's 2025 Visionary of the Year.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 The future is further away than many predicted. While experts previously forecasted that by now the world will be quickly moving toward a battery-electric vehicle and autonomous future\u2014not just for passenger cars, but for helicopters, taxis, shuttles and commercial vehicles\u2014that's not the case. Instead, predictions of Toyota Motor Corporation Chairman Akio Toyoda, Newsweek 's 2023 World's Greatest Auto Disruptors Executive of the Year, are reality. The world's drivers, especially Americans, aren't ready or willing to give up their gasoline-powered vehicles, driving or independence quite yet. They're embracing hybrid technology, insisting on driving themselves (with advanced driver assistance systems only sometimes turned on) and learning to embrace enhanced, tech-forward interior ecosystems. \"Automakers aren't abandoning BEVs but recalibrating to meet consumer demand. The shift toward hybrids isn't a step back as much as it's a response to economic pressures, charging infrastructure limitations and regulatory and trade uncertainty,\" Paul Waatti, director of analysis at AutoPacific, told Newsweek . Car on the road with motion blur background. - stock photo Car on the road with motion blur background. - stock photo hxdyl/Getty \"It's not about giving up on BEVs\u2014it's about timing and offering a range of options to meet consumers where they are in the transition. Current market conditions demonstrate that there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\" Automakers are set up for a busy few years ahead, debuting a host of BEVs. But questions remain about their widespread appeal. Waatti said: \"A wider selection of BEVs is coming to all corners of the market in 2025, but the question isn't just about variety\u2014it's about affordability and infrastructure. Without federal incentives, mainstream adoption could stall, especially in middle America, where charging access is still glaringly inconsistent. \"We're at an inflection point: If BEVs don't become more cost-competitive on their own, the market will stagnate. Incentives and tax credits help bridge the gap but that's not a sustainable equation. Long-term success hinges on automakers driving down costs through better battery tech and production efficiencies.\" Commercial Applications While all-electric passenger car adoption growth is slow, BEV commercial vehicles are becoming more pervasive. Rivian recently opened up sales of its EDV, or Electric Delivery Van, and ECV, or Electric Commercial Van, to the public after years of Amazon exclusivity. Chevrolet is now selling BrightDrop's vehicle line, Ram and Ford continue electric van deliveries and the United States Postal Service is now using next-generation electric mail trucks. \"Battery-electric vehicles are a natural fit for delivery fleets. With software-driven route optimization, delivery schedules can be mapped out based on cargo and range, eliminating the need for mid-route charging. Plus, BEVs have fewer moving parts, reducing maintenance costs and maximizing uptime. Beyond efficiency, BEV vans offer unmatched configuration flexibility. Thanks to their 'skateboard' chassis design and low center of gravity, they can be configured in ways traditional internal combustion engine vans can't, optimizing cargo space and drivability. Quieter, cleaner and cheaper to operate, BEV delivery vans aren't just a trend\u2014they're the future of last-mile logistics,\" Tony Salerno, vice president at J.D. Power, told Newsweek . AI is also a key ingredient in the autonomous vehicle equation. Commercial vehicle route mapping, in-car entertainment and predictive safety features can be enabled and enhanced by artificial intelligence. But, developing autonomous vehicle technology is expensive and profits are years, if not decades, away. Even as Waymo expands its limited fleet to more cities and Hyundai manufactures robotaxi versions of its Ioniq 5 , General Motors stopped funding its Cruise self-driving taxi operations. \"Cruise's shutdown is a stark reminder that full autonomy is still a long-term play with massive hurdles. Waymo's expansion shows that autonomy isn't dead, but it does raise the question: Is this a tech company's game rather than an automaker's? Traditional original equipment manufacturers may need to rethink their role\u2014are they building self-driving vehicles or just integrating third-party tech?\" Waatti posited. \"Some narratives within the industry have shifted from 'when' to 'if' full autonomy will be viable in boundaryless urban settings. The business case for autonomous trucking or controlled environments like geofenced campuses still holds firm, but the road to fully autonomous consumer vehicles is looking far longer than expected,\" he said. Racing Tech Race cars are the opposite of autonomous vehicles, but they're just as important. As ever, they stand not just as entertainment for legions of fans, but as proving grounds for future technologies, including batteries and hybridization. Said Waatti: \"Cadillac in F1 [Formula 1], Ford and Genesis in endurance racing , and Audi in Dakar [off-road, desert racing] all signal that automakers still perceive value in motorsports\u2014not just for marketing but also for developing new technologies that trickle down to production cars. \"It is a unique moment where automakers are prioritizing both extreme performance and extreme efficiency. Racing isn't just about lap times anymore; it's a proving ground for electrification, aerodynamics and battery durability. Look for motor sports to play a more prominent role in vehicle development and technology, not a smaller one.\" One area where BEVs are well-established and growing are delivery vans used for last-mile logistics, like these Rivian ones for Amazon. One area where BEVs are well-established and growing are delivery vans used for last-mile logistics, like these Rivian ones for Amazon. Mobile Living Spaces Automakers are also ensuring that the human experience is not forgotten about during the transition to BEV and autonomous vehicles. The car cabin is now a technology showcase that serves up equal parts information and entertainment. \" Starbucks might not want you lingering, but automakers sure do. The rise of in-car entertainment, spa-like seating and AI-driven interfaces shows that vehicles are evolving beyond transportation into mobile living spaces. Whether it's work, relaxation or entertainment, the car is becoming the next-gen 'third place,'\" Waatti said. These spaces are also points of revenue generation for automakers and their affiliated app partners. \"Reimagining cars as extensions of personal space could drive one of the most profound lifestyle shifts in vehicle use\u2014and automaker profits\u2014since the rise of the SUV,\" Waatti said, forecasting that subscriptions for everything from seat heaters to movie streaming services are about to become more commonplace. Fits and Startups Over the past few years, startup automakers have been leading the charge, whether it is on the power or infotainment side of the business. But, having the right formula for long-term success remains elusive for many, with Canoo, Fisker and Nikola all put out to pasture with bankruptcy filings. \"The biggest test for startups isn't engineering\u2014it's financial endurance. Tesla survived because it scaled at the right time. Rivian and Lucid must prove they can do the same before legacy automakers catch up and outpace them with broader portfolios and sheer volume,\" Waatti said. \"The race isn't just about innovation anymore\u2014it's about scaling quickly,\" Salerno added. How We Did It To determine the candidates for this year's World's Greatest Auto Disruptors, Newsweek 's Autos team, led by Senior Autos Editor Eileen Falkenberg-Hull, compiled a list considering every major automaker in each of the award categories. Brands, teams and individuals were nominated based on their cumulative merits for the past year, after combing through each candidate's accomplishments in the areas of future product planning, business strategy, technology, marketing, engineering, sustainability, manufacturing, community and research and development. To be considered, candidates had to be employing executive decision-making, corporate strategy, product development and publicity in a way that is driving fundamental, transformative change in the automotive market, with measurable real-world results\u2014or have clear and demonstrable potential to do so. The Legacy award honors an individual who has achieved these results over decades in the industry. The list of nominees was narrowed by Autos editors. Winners were chosen after a consensus was reached amongst the Autos team and Newsweek top editors.

When he was in college, he decided to do something about it. Decades later, the success of Scaringe's vision, a new battery-electric vehicle automaker, is improbable at best. Rivian isn't just producing vehicles people want to buy, the company is turning a profit. \"I started the company to drive as much impact as possible, and to be a positive contributor to this really large change we need to see in how our transportation systems function. That's everything from how the vehicles are designed to how they're architected, to electrification,\" Scaringe told Newsweek . Through partnerships with Amazon and Volkswagen Group, strategic government assistance and shrewd manufacturing practices, Rivian is beating the odds. It hasn't always been sunshine and roses. An early deal with Ford dissipated and the company has seen its fair share of employee churn. RJ Scaringe, Rivian RJ Scaringe, Rivian Adewale Agboola \"The nature of starting a business like this is really different than most types of new companies because you need so many things that are all hard to get. If you're being intellectually honest, you need many billions of dollars of capital. You need hundreds of suppliers to provide the components going to the vehicles. You need thousands of engineers working in parallel and on top of all that, you need technology and product that's highly compelling and would lead customers to want to purchase your product,\" Scaringe said. \"The first penny of revenue in a business like this takes many billions of dollars,\" he said. The CEO describes the origin of Rivian being \"a system of challenges.\" He caught himself wondering how to raise capital when he didn't have the technology to back it up. How do you go to a supplier when you don't have a product or a company bigger than one person? \"If you think about it too much, it almost scares you away. You have to just start working on it. So, I started working on it.\" Decades after Scaringe first imagined Rivian, both his company and family have flourished. Here with sons, from left to right, Max, Pete and Miles at R2 and R3 reveal event in Los Angeles. Decades after Scaringe first imagined Rivian, both his company and family have flourished. Here with sons, from left to right, Max, Pete and Miles at R2 and R3 reveal event in Los Angeles. NATHAN HELEINE Scaringe raised a small amount of capital, \"enough to demonstrate some fraction of the idea of what we wanted to ultimately build,\" he said. \"We had some big pivots along the way in terms of products and then ultimately got to a point where the product, the brand, the strategy, started to become really clear and after a bunch of experimentation that helped facilitate us raising a lot more money.\" Before going public, the company raised around $12 billion and decided to launch three products at nearly the same time, in contrast to how Tesla , Lucid and most automakers started. One of Rivian's most pivotal moments was its 2019 agreement with Amazon, which provided much-needed cash in exchange for commercial van sales exclusivity for four years. Read more Rivian's changing the charging game, one destination at a time Rivian ready for mass market, goes smaller with more affordable R2 and R3 All this was during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"You almost couldn't have imagined a harder operating environment to launch into,\" Scaringe said. The company wasn't just readying to build electric vehicles. It also had to build its manufacturing facility, a refit of a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois. \"More than 100 truckloads of equipment was showing up between February and March of 2020, so it's like perfectly hard timing. And when our equipment was there, we didn't have people to come install the equipment, because you couldn't be on site or together. So, we had to learn how to run a large construction and capital expenditure project at the start of COVID and through COVID,\" he explained, as well as ramp up and hire people. The supply chain crisis of 2021 and 2022 hit the company hard, too, with many suppliers prioritizing larger automakers, but Scaringe toughed it out. Rivian R3 Rivian R3 Elliot Ross Studio R1T and R1S R1T and R1S Andi Hedrick \"We felt that ultimately, electrification going from where it is today, less than 10 percent of new vehicle sales, to 100 percent in the next decade or two is going to require highly compelling products,\" he said. One of Scaringe's core ideas, keeping a technology stack completely in-house, was controversial. \"I was a little bit crazy to do all of our software and all of our electronics in-house, but it's proven to be the exact right decision,\" Scaringe said. \"There weren't a lot of people believing...and it's been remarkable to see that those decisions become validated.\" Rivian's products aren't only its vehicles. Last year, Rivian signed a $5.8 billion joint venture with Volkswagen Group to license the startup automaker's software platform and some electronics. Those bits will underpin the new Scout Motors vehicles . Some of Scout's top engineers are Rivian veterans.

The plant is expected to assemble up to 400,000 BEVs annually, starting with the R2 and R3 SUVs . Strategic decisions that resulted in a gross profit of $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the maturing business model of the Rivian brand in a BEV-adverse environment are why RJ Scaringe is Newsweek 's 2025 Executive Disruptor of the Year.

Car rental giant Hertz Corporation disclosed a data breach that impacted its Hertz, Thrifty, and Dollar brands. Threat actors gained access to customer data via Cleo zero-day exploits in late 2024. \u201cCleo is a vendor that provides a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. On February 10, 2025, we confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo\u2019s platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\u201d reads the data breach notification published by the company. \u201cHertz immediately began analyzing the data to determine the scope of the event and to identify individuals whose personal information may have been impacted.\u201d According to data breach notification shared with the Maine\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office, 3,409 Maine residents were affected. The notifications were also sent to California and Vermont, though both states don\u2019t disclose the number of affected individuals. In January 2025, the Clop ransomware group added 59 new companies to its leak site, the gang claimed to have breached them by exploiting a vulnerability \u200b\u200bin Cleo file transfer products . In December 2024, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability CVE-2024-50623 (CVSS score 8.8), which impacts multiple Cleo products to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog . The vulnerability affects the following products LexiCom before version 5.8.0.21, Harmony prior to version 5.8.0.21, and VLTrader prior to version 5.8.0.21. On December 9, reports of active exploitation targeting Cleo file transfer software began circulating among cybersecurity community. Security firm Huntress publicly disclosed ongoing exploitation involving three different Cleo products. Huntress researchers created a proof of concept and learned the patch does not mitigate the software flaw. The experts warned that fully patched systems running 5.8.0.21 are still exploitable. The Clop ransomware group claimed to have contacted the breached organizations, but they ignored ransom negotiations, so the gang threatens to publish stolen data on January 18, 2025. In January, a spokesperson for U.S. car rental giant Hertz told TechCrunch that it is \u201caware\u201d of Clop\u2019s claims, but added there is \u201cno evidence that Hertz data or Hertz systems have been impacted at this time.\u201d Hertz confirmed on April 2, 2025, that a breach exposed customer data, including names, contacts, DOB, credit card, driver\u2019s license information and information related to workers\u2019 compensation claims. A small number of people may have had their SSNs, government IDs, passport info, medical IDs, or injury-related claim data exposed in the breach. Hertz confirmed Cleo addressed the breach, notified law enforcement and regulators, and offers 2 years of free Kroll identity monitoring. The company hasn\u2019t detected any misuse of the exposed data but advises affected individuals to stay vigilant, monitor accounts and credit reports, and report any suspicious activity. Clop group already targeted enterprise file transfer software in the past, a large-scale hacking campaign exploited vulnerabilities in MOVEit Transfer and GoAnywhere .

Non-resident Indians with valid visas, including workers, students, and visitors, are generally not impacted. Representative image The recent guidelines on registration for those on visas in the US, which were recently announced by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, have been causing a lot of fear and apprehension among Indians. However, the new rules largely apply to those aliens who are in the US but don\u2019t have legal status, and most non-resident Indians, who are working or studying in the US, or those visiting, will not be impacted. \u201cThere is a great deal of confusion surrounding the registration requirements that kicked in from April 11, 2025, and particularly about who should re-register and who need not. We are receiving a lot of calls surrounding this issue from visa holders as well as green card holders,\u201d Shilpa Gokare, owner and managing partner at Gokare Law Firm, which handles business immigration cases and has offices in the USA and India, told the Times of India. The G-325R requirements for visa holders are new, while the I-90 requirements, for green card holders who turn 14, have always been in place, she added. The G-325R is a new form introduced by the USCIS, for biometric information registration online; by which unregistered aliens may register and comply with the law. Form I-90 is the application process used by lawful permanent residents in the US to apply for replacement or renewal of existing green cards. \u201cAll those Indians who have an I-94 are already considered registered, including children under 14 years of age. However, once children on the visa categories of H-4, L-2, TD, R-2 and B-2 turn 14 years of age, then they must once again apply for re-registration within 30 days of turning 14 and get finger-printed,\u201d Gokare said. She added that the process to register is to E-file Form G-325R. \u201cChildren who turn 14 years of age must create their own USCIS account and submit Form G-325R.\u201d H-4 and L-2 are for dependents of H-1B and L-1 work permit visa holders; TD is a trade dependent visa; R-2 visa is for dependents of religious workers on R-1, and B-2 is for temporary visitors to the US. The I-94, officially the \u2018arrival/departure record\u2019, is a document issued by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that records a visitor\u2019s arrival and departure from the United States. It serves as proof of legal entry and specifies the permitted length of stay. In most cases, it\u2019s an electronic travel record maintained by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP); though in some situations paper I-94s are also issued. The I-94 record is very important for non-immigrant visa categories including F-1 students; H-1B work permit holders and B-1/B-2 visitors. It provides proof of legal entry, status and duration of stay, and can be accessed at the CBP website at WWW.CBP.GOV/I94. Requirements for green card holders on legal permanent resident status are different from non-immigrant visa categories. \u201cAll green card holders under 14 years of age must file a form I-90 within 30 days of their 14th birthday to notify USCIS that they have turned 14,\u201d Gokare said. Filing fees will depend on when their current green card expires. If their green card expires after their 16th birthday then there will be no filing fees. \u201cIf the current green card expires before their 16th birthday, then the filing fees shall apply along with the submission of the I-90,\u201d Gokare said.

Upgrade Now Marjorie Taylor Greene Made Large Stock Purchases Ahead Of Trump's 90-Day Tariff Pause: Hakeem Jeffries Calls It 'Problematic' Namrata Sen Tue, Apr 15, 2025, 3:00 AM 2 min read Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) disclosed her significant stock purchases made just before and on the day of President Donald Trump \u2018s announcement to pause global tariffs. This announcement had a substantial impact on the stock market. What Happened : Based on the information disclosed to the House, Greene bought stocks valued between $21,000 and $315,000 on April 8 and 9. On April 8, she also sold Treasury bills worth between $50,000 and $100,000, according to the Benzinga Government Trades tracker. Greene\u2019s stock purchases included shares in several companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which has since appreciated by approximately 5%. She also invested in other tech firms, energy companies like Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN ), and pharmaceutical giant Merck & Company (NYSE: MRK ). On April 8, Greene bought stocks in Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR ) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ). These transactions occurred as government bond yields were on the rise amidst the tariff turmoil. Here's a look at the stocks Greene purchased during the period: Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT ) ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ: ASML ) Blackstone Inc. (NYSE: BX ) Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI ) Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN ) FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ) JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) Merck & Company (NYSE: MRK ) Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE ) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR ) Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO ) Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) SEE ALSO : Jensen Huang Praised By Trump: Nvidia \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Be Doing\u2019 $500 Billion AI Infrastructure Commitment Without Tariffs Why It Matters : Greene\u2019s stock trades have raised eyebrows, especially considering the timing of her purchases. The trades coincided with former President Trump\u2019s tariff pause announcement, which led to a significant surge in the stock market. This has led to calls for an investigation into potential insider trading related to President Trump\u2019s market communications before the tariff pause announcement. Key Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have expressed concerns about possible corruption. Schiff and Warren pointed out a post on Truth Social where Trump encouraged buying stocks just hours before the tariff pause announcement that sent markets soaring. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York urged a ban on stock trading by members of Congress following the revelation of Ms. Greene's investment activities. He told MSNBC on Monday, \"We obviously have to continue to highlight why this is problematic.\" Story Continues READ MORE: Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos Once Made His Grandmother Cry Trying To Show Off His Math Skills \u2014 That Day, His Grandfather Gave Him A Life-Changing Piece Of Wisdom Image via Shutterstock Disclaimer : This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

It also covers various important aspects of the market. These include an analysis of the competitive landscape, market dynamics, market estimates in terms of value, and future trends in the building integrated photovoltaic market. April 15, 2025 04:01 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Building Integrated Photovoltaic Market by Technology (C-Si (Monocrystalline, Polycrystalline), Thin Film), Application (Roofing, Facades, Externally Integrated Systems), End User (Residential, Commercial, Industrial), Region - Global Forecast to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The building integrated photovoltaic market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 12.49 billion in 2024 to USD 27.41 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 17.0% Environmental restrictions on carbon reduction are becoming more stringent across the world, and governments are rewarding this, giving a boost to numerous goods and technologies, like BIPV systems, for sustainable construction practices. Improved efficiency, flexibility, and aesthetic aspects in photovoltaic technology are making BIPV products more viable for home and commercial applications. These are the key factors driving the growth of the building integrated photovoltaic market. The building integrated photovoltaic market is dominated by a few major players that have a wide regional presence. The leading players in the building integrated photovoltaic market are LONGi (China), JinkoSolar (China), JA SOLAR Technology Co., Ltd. (China), AGC Inc. (Japan), and Canadian Solar (Canada) among others. The major strategy adopted by the players includes new product launches, partnerships, collaboration, mergers, and investments & expansions. Thin Film, by technology segment to be the fastest-growing market from 2024 to 2029 Thin-film solar cells permit a large degree of flexibility, which allows them to integrate into much more surfaces and architectural designs, including curved or irregular surfaces, which is a demand that becomes more frequent in modern building designs. Being lighter than crystalline silicon, thin-film panels are easier to install on various structures without significant structural reinforcement. Their sleek, low-profile design also enhances the aesthetic appeal of buildings. Thin film technology works better in low-light conditions and with varied angles of sunlight, so it is more suitable for any urban setting where buildings may not always be exposed to direct sunlight throughout the day. It can be observed that thin-film solar cells have a lower temperature coefficient compared to crystalline silicon, which essentially means they have less efficiency loss at higher temperatures. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in hot climates. Facades, by application, is expected to be the fastest-growing market from 2024 to 2029 Facades have a larger and more vertical surface area than roofing, allowing them to capture sunlight throughout the day at a variety of angles. This may be particularly relevant in urban locations where roof space is relatively small. Having innovative facades that are able to integrate photovoltaic cells in such a way that they enhance the aesthetic appeal of a building while carrying out their practical function of energy generation may speak well to architects and developers. BIPV systems in building facades - aside from their insulation, which contributes to an energy-efficient reduction of both heating and cooling loads - have the added ability to generate electricity, thus being cost-effective for energy management. Looking at the high rise of buildings in cities, the facade is a gigantic, unexploited field of potential for the integration of solar technology, as most buildings have very small roof surfaces but very large vertical fields. Residential segment, by end user, is expected to be the fastest-growing market from 2024 to 2029 Homeowners are more sensitive to environmental impact that comes from the consumption of energy. This drives the demand for sustainable energy solutions; hence BIPV, which enables the production of clean energy straight from their homes. For residential consumers, ways of reducing or minimizing the energy bills under relentless upward pressure in terms of the cost of energy used have been a front-burner concern. The BIPV system makes it a long-term solution since a home can independently produce a huge electric power amount that greatly reduces expenses on utilities. BIPVs are designed to fit various building materials; hence, it is also a friendly aesthetic option to homeowners for whom the appearance of their homes is critical. As consumer behavior is growing pro-environment, residential consumers now also wish to fulfill an inner whim of cutting on their carbon footprint. BIPV enables householders to contribute towards reduced greenhouse gas emission while using clean, renewable energy. Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the building integrated photovoltaic market. These countries in the Asia Pacific region are urbanizing at a rapid rate and have new construction markets on a large scale, hence providing much potential for integration of BIPV systems in modern buildings to meet their energy demands in a sustainable way. Another reason is that, in countries like the Asia Pacific region, especially China, Japan, and India, a lot of encouraging policies and financial incentives have been worked out in support of renewable energy and green building technologies, including BIPV. Strong economic growth in Asia Pacific countries drives investments into infrastructure and real estate development. On its side, such growth supports the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies like BIPV in new buildings. As a leading innovation hub for photovoltaic technologies, major manufacturers from the Asia Pacific region keep coming up with advanced BIPV technology, hence making it more efficient and attractive. Ambitious targets in the diffusion of renewable energy set by countries in this region are viewed as a way in which BIPV systems will spur growth in the market. Growing awareness about climate change and environmental sustainability influences building practices. The regional efforts to reduce carbon footprint and green building practices are aligned with the BIPV systems. Key Benefits of Buying the Report Increasing emphasis on net zero emissions and supporting government regulations are just a few of the primary drivers propelling the building integrated photovoltaic market. Regulatory and legislative uncertainties, as well as costly initial capital expenditure, limit the market's expansion. The ongoing energy shift to reduce carbon emissions is likely to provide attractive prospects for building integrated photovoltaic market participants.

The DOJ charged 40-year-old Jamison Wagner with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives. Wagner is the chief suspect in the February 9 fire at the Tesla Albuquerque Showroom, and the March 30 fire at the Republican Party New Mexico (RPNM) office. The Albuquerque resident was charged following a search at his home which found evidence linking him to the attacks, including a stencil reading \" ICE = KKK\" which matched graffiti left at the RPNM office following the fire, materials for making incendiary devices, and a jar with a green gingham-style lid which was similar to other jars found at the crime scenes. Tesla arson suspect from surveillance footage (left), Wagner\u2019s driver\u2019s license (right). Tesla arson suspect from surveillance footage (left), Wagner\u2019s driver\u2019s license (right). Justice Department Why It Matters There have been some 80 reported vandalism or arson incidents at Tesla dealerships since Donald Trump took office and Tesla CEO Elon Musk became a critical part of his administration . The FBI has formed a task-force specifically for combatting what they have called \"violent activity toward Tesla,\" which they have labelled as \"domestic terrorism.\" What To Know The Albuquerque resident was charged following a search at his home which found evidence linking him to the attacks, including a stencil reading \"ICE = KKK\" which matched graffiti left at the RPNM office following the fire, materials for making incendiary devices, and a jar with a green gingham-style lid which was similar to other jars found at the crime scenes. Objects found at the crime scenes and on surveillance which are consistent with evidence found in Wagner's home. Objects found at the crime scenes and on surveillance which are consistent with evidence found in Wagner's home. Department of Justice The search of his home also found a white box with eight assembled suspected incendiary devices inside. This white box appeared similar to the white cardboard box carried by the suspect on surveillance footage outside of the Tesla dealership on February 9. FBI and ATF investigators also found blue Styrofoam egg cartons which matched the polystyrene material found in the improvised napalm used in the Tesla fire and flammable liquids consistent with the gasoline used at both fire scenes. Other evidence which the DOJ claim link Wagner to the crime scenes include several jars marked with handwritten capital letters \"I\" or \"H,\" which appeared to be similar to handwritten markings seen on lids found at both arson sites, and black and red spray paint which matched the graffiti used at both crime scenes. Wagner's 2015 white Hyundai Accent was also found in his garage. It matched the white car spotted on surveillance footage from the RPNM headquarters fire. The Tesla dealership fire resulted in one Tesla being significantly damaged, and one being burnt. The suspect left black and red graffiti on the walls of the dealership and six other vehicles, which said: \"Die Elon,\" \"Tesla Nazi Inc,\" and \"Die Tesla Nazi,\" along with swastika symbols. The RPNM fire resulted in damage to the front door and entry area. The suspect also left graffiti which read \"ICE = KKK.\" Main: ICE = KKK stencil found in Wagner's home, according to the DOJ, Inset: ICE = KKK grafitti found in the Republican Party office Main: ICE = KKK stencil found in Wagner's home, according to the DOJ, Inset: ICE = KKK grafitti found in the Republican Party office Department of Justice As of this moment, Wagner has not been charged with domestic terrorism, however his charges may result in him spending 20 years in prison for each of his two counts if found guilty. Attorney General Pam Bondi also warned in March that Tesla vandals could spend 20 years in prison. Vandalism at Tesla showrooms is not connected to the peaceful Tesla Takedown protests which have occurred across the country. What People Are Saying Acting U.S. Attorney Holland S. Kastrin for the District of New Mexico: \"The charges today demonstrate that there is no place in our society for politically or ideologically motivated acts of violence and extremism. We are grateful for the tireless and exceptional work of our law enforcement partners to identify the alleged perpetrator of these unacceptable criminal acts and commit to prosecuting this case to the fullest extent of the law.\" FBI Director Kash Patel on X : \"The FBI has been investigating the increase in violent activity toward Tesla, and over the last few days, we have taken additional steps to crack down and coordinate our response. This is domestic terrorism. Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice.\" What Happens Next Wagner is presumed innocent until proven guilty. He could face between five and 20 years in prison if found guilty of two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives.

Security researchers at Huntress warn of attacks in the wild exploiting a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-30406 , in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox software. The vulnerability CVE-2025-30406 (CVSS score 9.0) is a deserialization issue due to the CentreStack portal\u2019s hardcoded machineKey use. Threat actors exploited the flaw in March attacks. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 16.4.10315.56368 released on April 3, 2025. \u201cThe application uses a hardcoded or improperly protected machineKey in the IIS web.config file, which is responsible for securing ASP.NET ViewState data. If an attacker obtains or predicts the machineKey, they can forge ViewState payloads that pass integrity checks. In some scenarios, this can result in ViewState deserialization attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the web server. Exploitation has been observed in the wild.\u201d reads the advisory . \u201cWe strongly recommend updating to the patched version, which improves key management and mitigates exposure. For customers who cannot update immediately, rotating the machineKey values is a recommended interim mitigation.\u201d The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog in April 2025. On April 11, 2025, Huntress detected suspicious activity linked to Gladinet CentreStack, tied to CVE-2025-30406. At least seven organizations were compromised by exploiting this zero-day. The researchers pointed out that a few hundred vulnerable servers exposed to the Internet are at risk. The CVE-2025-30406 flaw in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox stems from hardcoded keys in web.config files, enabling ViewState deserialization attacks. If unpatched, this allows remote code execution and full server compromise. Both root and portal configs must be secured to prevent exploitation. \u201cThis weakness can be leveraged to abuse the ASPX ViewState, a mechanism used to preserve the state of a web page and its controls between multiple HTTP requests. The hardcoded keys open the door for a very standard and well-researched attack technique with ViewState deserialization.\u201d reads the report published by cybersecurity firm Huntress. \u201cIf a Gladinet CentreStack or Triofox server is exposed to the Internet with these hardcoded keys, it is in immediate danger and needs to be patched or have the machineKey values changed as soon as possible . CVE-2025-30406 is known to be actively exploited by threat actors, and this 9.0 critical severity issue has no \u201cprerequisites\u201d other than knowing the default key values.\u201d Exploiting CVE-2025-30406 allows remote code execution as IISAPPPOOL\\portaluser, with easy privilege escalation to SYSTEM. Huntress demonstrated the risk with a working proof-of-concept exploit targeting Triofox web.config files. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any intentions of sharing the proof-of-concept to embolden other adversaries, but once an external exploit is shared publicly we will update this blog to include the technical details of recreating the attack script.\u201d continues the report. \u201cWe can confirm the Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox patches are effective in stopping exploitation from our tested proof-of-concept.\u201d In one attack, Huntress spotted an encoded PowerShell command used to download and run a DLL, the experts noticed that the technique was also seen in recent CrushFTP vulnerability exploits. The researchers observed the threat actors using lateral movement to install MeshCentral remote access tools. On the second host, attackers executed Impacket commands, MeshAgent, and Centre.exe. Huntress found approximately 120 endpoints running vulnerable Gladinet CentreStack software and is urging partners to patch CVE-2025-30406. The company released detection tools and Sigma rules. Gradient addressed the flaw and confirmed that the issue is actively exploited.

The chip, which is claimed to be more powerful than Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin X, would be used in all its production models as the EV maker promoted its cutting-edge technologies, CEO He Xiaopeng said in an interview. The chip could also power flying cars and robots being developed by its affiliated companies, he added. \u201cOur chips will be seen in our cars all over the world in future,\u201d he told the Post in Hong Kong. \u201cWe hope traffic rules in Hong Kong and other overseas markets will allow our cars with autonomous driving systems to take to the streets sometime next year.\u201d He did not disclose which EV model would start using its self-developed chip. He, who is also the company\u2019s founder, made the remarks ahead of Xpeng\u2019s Global Brand Night event in Hong Kong on Tuesday, when the EV maker\u2019s latest products and technologies, including drones and autonomous driving platform, will be displayed. Level of intelligence has become the new battleground for carmakers to overcome cutthroat competition in China. Xpeng\u2019s Turing chip, designed for level 4 (L4) autonomous driving capabilities, was three times more powerful in computing power than Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin X installed in its existing smart vehicles, the CEO said in August. The chip, the brain of Xpeng\u2019s AI platform known as Canghai, symbolises the Guangzhou-based carmaker\u2019s vision in developing full-stack, indigenous autonomous driving technology for mass-produced EVs in mainland China since its establishment in 2014. At present, Xpeng\u2019s cars such as the P7 sedan and G6 SUV can navigate their way automatically on mainland China\u2019s highways and streets, but drivers are required to be fully alert with their hands on the wheel. They are deemed as semi-autonomous and categorised as L2+ vehicles. L3 is considered a \u201chands-off\u201d system, but still requires drivers to be responsible for safety and ready to take over, while L4 would allow drivers to take their eyes off the road in designated areas, according to standards set by US-based SAE International. Last month, Xpeng said it would test its AI-powered self-driving technology in Hong Kong, taking its first step in expanding globally with its semi-autonomous vehicles. \u201cLeading Chinese carmakers like Xpeng have proven to be superior to Tesla in autonomous driving capabilities, when both their cars are clogging the mainland roads,\u201d said David Zhang, general secretary of the Shanghai-based International Intelligent Vehicle Engineering Association. \u201cBut their technologies are only locally operated and are not as international as Tesla\u2019s FSD [full self-driving] system.\u201d Still, Tesla\u2019s FSD software \u2013 which became available on the mainland in February for 64,000 yuan (RM38,692 or US$8,776) \u2013 performs more poorly than Xpeng\u2019s driver assistance system in reading lane markings and recognising traffic lights, according to Zhang. Xpeng last year expanded the use of its preliminary self-driving system, known as X NGP or navigation guided pilot, to all mainland cities to attract more buyers ahead of Tesla\u2019s launch of its FSD software in China. It became the first on the mainland to offer a semi-autonomous driving system nationwide. AeroHT, an affiliate of Xpeng, is also among the leading players that develop flying cars on the mainland. Tesla is the front runner in mainland China\u2019s premium EV market segment. Xpeng, Shanghai-based Nio and Beijing-headquartered Li Auto are viewed as China\u2019s best responses to the market leader. \u2013 South China Morning Post Open Modal \u00d7 Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) The Associated Press NEW YORK -- As President Donald Trump pushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the Democratic Party's core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them. The Democrats' dominant national fundraising platform, ActBlue, and the party's largest protest group, Indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. Trump's top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution. Other Democratic allies are planning for Trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. Wary of antagonizing the president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now. \u201cEvery one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the Trump administration. We are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves,\" said Ezra Reese, political law chair at Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by Marc Elias, the lawyer who has himself been a Trump target. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into ActBlue and Indivisible. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether Trump wants the FBI, the Treasury Department or any other federal agency to investigate Democratic groups. \u201cAnyone who has (not) broken the law should not be worried,\" Leavitt told The Associated Press. \"If you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key Republicans are embracing it. Trump's allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, one of which led to multiple felony convictions in New York. There's no evidence former President Joe Biden influenced the Trump prosecutions in any way. Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, said Democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove. \u201cSomeone needs to get burned for all this activity or they\u2019re just gonna do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hypocrisy; that\u2019s justice.\u201d Trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries. During a norm-breaking speech at the Department of Justice last month, Trump cast himself as the country\u2019s \u201cchief law enforcement officer,\u201d a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. Trump said that Taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty. Indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the Democratic resistance since Trump returned to the White House. The group\u2019s leadership in Washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country. This year alone, Indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. The group was a key organizer in the recent Hands Off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Trump top adviser and billionaire Elon Musk has publicly condemned Indivisible as \u201ccriminals.\u201d The statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against Tesla dealerships and vehicles, which have spiked in recent weeks. Indivisible\u2019s leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside Tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property. No charges are known to have been filed against Indivisible or its leaders. But Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin says it\u2019s critical that Democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the Trump administration. His organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other Indivisible leaders face criminal charges. \u201cThey may try to come at us directly, or it\u2019s as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd that is a risk in a moment where you\u2019re facing anti-democratic threats like we are.\u201d \u201cOur choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they won\u2019t target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do that, what are you doing here?\u201d Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party's main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates. \u201cI think the FBI\u2019s going to do something on ActBlue soon,\u201d Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, said at a political event last month in Wisconsin. ActBlue officials this week told the AP that they would continue to cooperate with a congressional investigation led by House Republicans into allegations of fraud within the organization. ActBlue is preparing a second batch of documents to comply with a new request by House Republicans. Additionally, two ActBlue staffers are expected to testify before a House panel behind closed doors later this month. Multiple House Republicans in recent weeks have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into ActBlue. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has asked the Treasury Department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to \u201cterror-linked organizations.\u201d Separately, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to \u201cto skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws\u201d by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing. \u201cIt must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of American citizens,\u201d Biggs wrote. ActBlue said it is preparing for the possibility of \u201cmany different attacks on various fronts,\u201d including investigations by the FBI or the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are relying on ActBlue to fund their campaigns as never before. Donors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the AP. The fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in ActBlue's two-decade history. While Republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, ActBlue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates that's funded by a 3.95% processing fee on each donation. \u201cThese unfounded attacks haven\u2019t shaken us \u2014 they\u2019ve sharpened our resolve to fuel Democratic wins,\" ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said. \"As our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, Democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment.\u201d Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the AP on First- and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

Print Share Facebook X LinkedIn Mail Languages: Fran\u00e7ais | Bulgarian Print Email Reddit Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram A trade deal aimed at avoiding Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on European exports will require a \"significant effort\" from both the EU and the US, the European Commission's trade chief said on Monday after meeting with American officials in Washington. Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said that Brussels remains committed to a \u201cmutual solution\u201d to address the US president\u2019s \u201cunjustified tariffs\u201d, which have plunged the world economy into turmoil and stoked fears of a global recession. The veteran commissioner also reiterated the EU\u2019s willingness to eliminate duties on industrial goods traded with the US and suggested Brussels could abolish \"non-tariff barriers\" to the \u20ac1.6 trillion transatlantic trade relationship. \u201cThe EU remains constructive and ready for a fair deal \u2013 including reciprocity through our 0-for-0 tariff offer on industrial goods and the work on non-tariff barriers,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said in a social media post after meeting with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer. \u201cAchieving this will require a significant joint effort on both sides,\u201d he added. US officials have repeatedly condemned the EU's high tariff rate on industrial products \u2013 especially the bloc's 10% import tax on cars, which is well above the US's 2.5% rate. Washington has also denounced the EU's other alleged trade restrictions, including its VAT rate and food safety laws. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said last week that such \"non-tariff barriers\" are \"orders of magnitude\" more important than the EU's import duties. There was no immediate US readout of Monday's meeting. Neither the Commerce Department nor the USTR immediately responded to requests for comment. \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s visit \u2013 his third to Washington since Trump\u2019s return to the White House in January \u2013 comes just days after the president suspended for 90 days sweeping \u201c reciprocal tariffs \u201d on US trading partners, including a 20% levy on the EU. The decision led Brussels to announce a similar \u201c pause \u201d on the imposition of retaliatory duties targeting \u20ac21 billion worth of US goods. Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium , and cars remain in effect, along with a 10% \u201cuniversal\u201d levy on all US imports. Tariffs of up to 145% are also currently in force on Chinese goods, triggering fears that significant quantities of Beijing's exports could be redirected and dumped on Europe. The EU's \u201c zero-for-zero \u201d proposal on industrial goods, announced last week, was quickly rejected by Trump. The president said the bloc should instead increase imports of American energy to avoid the tariffs, which he claims are necessary to boost US manufacturing. Trump also said on Sunday that tariffs on semiconductors would be announced \u201cover the next week\u201d. On Monday, he added that duties on pharmaceutical goods would be declared \"in the not-too-distant future\" \u2013 a move that could severely harm Denmark and Ireland's export-oriented industries. \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s visit comes ahead of Italian leader Giorgia Meloni's meeting with Trump in the US on Thursday, amid fears that Washington is seeking to \" divide and rule \" EU member states. Meloni was the only European leader invited to Trump\u2019s inauguration and has also cultivated warm personal ties with Elon Musk , the billionaire Tesla owner and Trump adviser. A Commission spokesperson said on Monday the Italian premier had been in \"regular contact\" with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of her visit. Meloni's \u201coutreach is very welcome and [is] closely coordinated\u201d with Brussels, the spokesperson said, adding that negotiating trade deals remains the Commission's \"exclusive competence\".

Article content Asked about US tariffs, executives at CATL, a top supplier to Tesla Inc. and many other large automakers, described the impact as \u201clittle\u201d and added the company\u2019s US exposure was \u201cquite small.\u201d Article content Citigroup Inc. analysts lead by Jack Shang wrote in a post-earnings note that CATL\u2019s management expects direct and indirect battery shipments to the US in the first quarter to be around 2-3% of its total business, lower than an initially expected 12%, suggesting the company may have already made some adjustments ahead of the tariffs. Article content Goldman Sachs Group Inc. however trimmed CATL\u2019s net income forecasts through 2027 on US volume cuts and some gross profit headwinds. Article content President Donald Trump wants to keep Chinese-made products out of the US and as a strategic response, CATL has been trying to insulate itself by licensing its technology, increasing research and development, abroad and sourcing materials from more neutral regions. R&D expenses for the period increased 11% to 4.8 billion yuan. Article content Article content CATL is also investing in overseas production facilities in places such as Germany and Hungary to localize manufacturing even though demand for EVs outside of China has softened. Weaker EV sales growth outside China has dented a key income stream that generates higher margins. Article content With Washington now charging tariffs of 145% on goods from China, CATL\u2019s market leading position faces being squeezed more than rivals such as South Korea\u2019s LG Energy Solution Ltd. There are also existing pressures from the Inflation Reduction Act, which was enacted under President Biden and which aims to reduce reliance on foreign entities deemed a national security risk. Article content Regardless, Ningde, Fujian-based CATL is pressing ahead with a secondary listing in Hong Kong and its mooted $5 billion-plus offering may become the largest globally this year. Article content And despite the challenging outlook, CATL remains in a comfortable position, with a global market share of around 38.2% based on data for first two months of the year, according to SNE Research. Its nearest competitor is fellow Chinese company BYD Co., at 16.9%. Article content Stock in CATL rose as much as 2.9% Tuesday. It\u2019s down around 13.2% this year.

With no sign of anyone backing down, the blinking has come from elsewhere, at least until the blows stop, it would seem. As Reuters reports, Tesla has suspended taking new orders for Model S and Model X vehicles on its Chinese website. Both models are made by the EV maker in the US and imported into China. The news agency said that new orders for the two models were also no longer available on the automaker\u2019s WeChat mini programme account in China. While Tesla did not give a reason for the move, the climbing tariffs is likely to be the reason why. Higher US tariffs would significantly increase the retail cost for Chinese consumers, making these cars more expensive than locally-produced EVs. However, the omission of both models isn\u2019t likely to be felt in the larger scheme of things, as China imported just 1,553 Model X and 311 Model S cars from the US in 2024. The two models accounted for less 0.5% of Tesla\u2019s deliveries of more than 657,000 vehicles in the country last year. Among automakers, the company isn\u2019t really affected by Trump\u2019s tariffs due to its largely domestic manufacturing for sales in the US, and its Model 3 and Model Y cars that are built at its Shanghai plant are for sale in the country and export to markets such as Europe.

By dropping a few (arguably) big features, such as air suspension, power tonneau cover, ventilated front seats, plus moving from dual-motor all-wheel-drive to single motor rear-wheel-drive, the new Cybertruck Long Range comes in under $63k (post federal tax credit) while gaining 25 miles greater range and quicker charging over other variants. Whether you're a Tesla or Elon Musk fan or not, there's no denying they've played a major role in pushing the EV market to the way it is today. It's thanks to cars like the Model S and Model 3 for demonstrating how addictive performance , bespoke software/features, and effective charging infrastructure can be mass produced and implemented. That said, Tesla (and Musk) are no strangers to controversy either\u2014from questionable build quality , endless recalls, stalled promises for Level 5 autonomous capabilities, and of course, the Cybertruck. Almost since the get-go, the Cybertruck has been a hard sell for the company, due in part to foibles surrounding its special design (that only a mother could love), stainless steel panels that not only tarnished over time but could also break fingers , as well as over pricing. The latter came from Musk's initial promise in 2019 that the electric truck would be priced under $40,000. By the time the delayed production units came about, customers were forking over $70,000 and up. Enter the new Cybertruck Long Range. At the $72,000 to start (before EV tax credits), this is the cheapest version yet, although obviously a far cry from the promised price in the 2019 announcement . To reach this price point however, customers have to make a quite a lot concessions. The biggest difference comes from dropping the dual-motor AWD setup to a single motor driving the rear wheels. While this allows the truck to achieve a 350-mile range (about 25 miles better than the average AWD model), 0-60 mph acceleration is reduced to 6.2 seconds (2.4 s slower), top speed is pegged at 112 mph, and tow rating limited to 7,500 lbs (3,500 less). Ground clearance is fixed at 9.6 inches because gone is the variable air suspension that could raise the truck up to 16 inches. The stock wheels will be 18-inch units wearing all-season threads, although buyers can option 20-inch rims with AT tires at the expense of a 19-mile reduction in range. But wait, there's more! Or should that be less? Anyway, the Cybertruck Long Range forgoes the power tonneau cover, the rear 9.4-inch passenger display, ventilated seats, and one cubic foot less cargo volume (perhaps taken up by the coil spring assembly below). Even the sound system gets a severe downgrade from 15 speakers to a measly seven. The Cybertruck Long Range is open for orders right now, with shipping starting in June. Even at this new low price, the Tesla has cheaper (and dare we say, better) alternatives from Ford's F-150 Lightning ($50,000 base) and Rivian's R1T ($72,000 base with dual motors).

Several days after that announcement, the Tesla and SpaceX boss publicly suggested that Navarro\u2019s Harvard University degrees are \u201ca bad thing, not a good thing.\u201d Initially, Navarro denied that there was a rift with Musk but dinged the DOGE guiding force for \u201cprotecting his own interests.\u201d Later, he jabbed that Musk was \u201cnot a car manufacturer\u201d but \u201ca car assembler\u201d \u2014 remarks that set off the billionaire into a fit of rhetorical rage. 4 Elon Musk has been pulling the strings in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost-cutting initiative.

Navarro, by contrast, has been a firm proponent of more duties to help combat what he has described as economic cheating by other nations. \u201cThe big problem we have are the non-tariff barriers, the currency manipulation, the dumping, the VAT taxes, all of that stuff that we have no defense against other than tariffs right now,\u201d Navarro argued. Trump has imposed 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico in a bid to extract concessions from them on fentanyl dissemination into the US. The president has also slapped a 25% tariff on foreign automobiles and key components, as well as a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. A 10% baseline tariff on virtually all other imports into the US remains in effect, as does a 125% reciprocal levy on China. 4 Peter Navarro is one of the most protectionist advisers in President Trump\u2019s orbit. AFP via Getty Images On Friday, the Trump administration released a rule to exempt electronic devices from the 125% tariff, but the president has since clarified that a specialized tariff on such imports is coming. \u201cThe problem, interestingly for chips, because this is very complex stuff, is that we don\u2019t buy a lot of chips, like in bags,\u201d Navarro explained. \u201cWe buy them in products.

This time, he sings to the tune of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s hit \u201cPlease Please Please.\u201d But, as always, Rainbow begins the video with a fake interview of Trump \u2014 though this time, the president gets a slight name change from \u201cDonald Jessica Trump\u201d to \u201cDonald Jessica Marie Antoinette Trump.\u201d \u201cYou know what?

Crosswalk buttons in Silicon Valley were hacked over the weekend to play voices imitating Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Anadolu/Getty Over the weekend, crosswalk pedestrian signals in the backyard of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk were hacked to play voices imitating their likeness. But they were not exactly kind to the billionaires, instead offering a commentary on the heightened polarization and distrust of the two leaders who have become more influential than ever in today\u2019s society and Washington in particular. In one video posted to TikTok, after the crosswalk button is pressed, it begins to say, \u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcefully insert AI into every facet of your conscious experience.\u201d It continues, \u201cI just want to assure you, you don\u2019t need to worry because there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.\u201d Meta has been pushing AI heavily, inserting \u201cMeta AI\u201d buttons into search boxes across its apps and promoting the idea of interacting with AI characters tailored to a user\u2019s interests in lieu of real humans. Recent surveying by YouGov found 44% of Americans are skeptical of AI over concerns ranging from invasion of personal privacy to the spread of misleading videos or deepfakes. But companies like Meta are betting that AI will enable more people to create content online and communicate with friends. @rosecampau our crosswalks just got vc funding apparently #paloalto #elonmusk #tesla #siliconvalley #walkablecities \u266c original sound \u2013 rose \u201cHi this is Elon Musk,\u201d begins another. \u201cWelcome to Palo Alto, the home of Tesla engineering. You know the saying \u2018money can\u2019t buy happiness,\u2019 I guess that\u2019s true. God knows I\u2019ve tried, but it can buy a Cybertruck and that\u2019s pretty sick, right?\u201d After a pause, the crosswalk audio continues, \u201cFuck I\u2019m so alone\u201d to an eruption of laughter in the background. It is fairly easy to recognize that the voices are synthetic, especially because Musk stutters often, and the voice in the video enunciates clearly. Sadly, by looking at the comments on TikTok it seems many people cannot get the joke and do not understand it was the consequence of a hack, not an authorized use of the CEOs\u2019 voices. It is less funny when the joke has to be explained. Officials for Redwood City, California, told Palo Alto Online that it was \u201cactively working to investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\u201d Comments on social media suggest the problems appear to have been resolved by Monday. The vendor that makes the voice-enabled crosswalks is reportedly a company called Polara, which offers pedestrian signal buttons that can communicate with crosswalk signals over Bluetooth. Hacking the audio signals puts the blind and otherwise impaired in some danger, but at least it seems the hackers kept all the necessary alerts in place\u2014the voices of Zuckerberg and Musk play after the signals are read. On the flip side, however, hearing these voices in particular might induce someone to walk into oncoming traffic. Palo Alto was recently the site of protests against Musk and Tesla over his political ambitions that have made the electric car brand toxic to its original customer base. While many people may think of Fremont, California or Austin, Texas as Tesla\u2019s home, its engineering base is still concentrated in Palo Alto where the company was founded back in 2003. Americans\u2019 views of both executives tilt more negative than positive, with a recent poll by Pew Research Center finding that just over half of U.S. adults view Musk unfavorably, while a whopping 67% dislike Zuckerberg. Musk, at least, is well-liked by Republicans with 73% favorability for his alignment with President Trump. Zuckerberg is not beloved by either party. Maybe the public sees through his facade and knows Zuckerberg\u2019s political hard-right tilt is nothing more than thinly veiled attempt at a quid-pro-quo. Meta\u2019s anti-trust case, which could see the company forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp , started on Monday. It is too bad that the billionaires would not likely hear the crosswalk voices themselves, since walking is, of course, something left to the plebeians.

Apr 14, 2025, 11:40am EDT Updated Apr 15, 2025, 09:33am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday the bank\u2019s research team does not expect to see a recession in 2025 after President Donald Trump\u2019s ever-changing tariff policies accelerated fears of a sharp downturn, though some of the most trusted observers of the economy say the U.S. is far from able to declare victory on a tariff-driven recession. NEW YORK, NEW YORK: Bank Of America CEO Brian Moynihan is interviewed by Jack Otter during \"Barron's ... More Roundtable\" at Fox Business Network Studios on January 09, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Moynihan cautioned that much could \u201c potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and other policies in the future path of the economy,\u201d and noted that the bank still lowered its GDP forecast for the year and does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates in 2025. Other big banks\u2019 economic models still indicate the chance of a recession remains a tossup, as Morgan Stanley forecasts 40% odds of a recession in 2025, Goldman Sachs places 45% likelihood of a recession over the next year and JPMorgan Chase projects 60% chance of a 2025 recession. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business' \u201cMornings With Maria\u201d Monday he is \u201c100% not\u201d expecting a recession in 2025, explaining recent discussions with CEOs indicated the \u201cuncertainty over tariffs\u201d won\u2019t be \u201ca big drag\u201d on the economy. Though the Trump administration\u2019s backdown last week from its most aggressive tariffs alleviated concerns the U.S. was on the cusp of a recession, Hassett\u2019s confidence is far from a consensus view among Wall Street bigwigs and prominent economists. Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said in a Sunday interview with NBC News: \u201cRight now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession, and I\u2019m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn\u2019t handled well.\u201d Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary during President Bill Clinton\u2019s term, said in a Monday editorial podcast in The New York Times he believes it\u2019s \u201csix in 10 or better that a recession will start this year,\u201d explaining: \u201cThe pause is certainly better than if we had simply charged along on the catastrophic path that we\u2019re on, but anybody who thinks the genie is back in the bottle and that it\u2019s all now OK should reconsider their position.\u201d Last week, Summers predicted such a downturn would leave an additional 2 million Americans unemployed, a more than 28% increase from the 7.1 million unemployed Americans in March, and a $5,000 or greater decline in annual household income. Moody's Analytics Mark Zandi said Monday on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d he sees the U.S. sinking into a recession over the next \u201cthree, four\u201d weeks if the policy uncertainty is still \u201cvery thick,\u201d saying he hopes \u201cthe president and the administration kind of finds an off ramp here and the trade war de-escalates.\u201d News Peg \u201cThe prospect of a recession has increased,\u201d Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a Monday earnings call. \u201cOur clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the significant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions,\u201d continued Solomon. Jamie Dimon\u2019s Recession Warnings Influenced Trump\u2019s Pause In a Wednesday morning interview just hours before Trump paused many of the more than 10% country-by-country levies, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told \u201cMornings With Maria\u201d he believed a tariff-spurred recession is \u201cprobably\u201d a \u201clikely outcome,\u201d adding he\u2019s heard \u201crecessionary talk\u201d in conversations with other business leaders. Trump said the comments from Dimon, the head of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets and market value, partially inspired his pause. Economists at JPMorgan had labeled Trump\u2019s policies as the \u201clargest tax increase\u201d since 1968 which will \u201cfall heavily on the US consumer.\u201d In JPMorgan\u2019s earnings call Friday, Dimon repeated his pushback against Trump\u2019s targeting of allies in his trade war, explaining the \u201cmost important thing to me is the Western world stays together economically.\u201d Stock Market Signals Slowdown Fears Stock prices don\u2019t completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing still in significantly increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 briefly dove into a 20% bear market last week, wiping out about $10 trillion in market value, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. But markets are still pricing \u201cnowhere close to the worst case\u201d scenario, Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank\u2019s chief strategist, said last Monday. Even after the post-pause recovery, the S&P is still down 12% from its February peak. Trump Administration Prepared Americans For The Possibility Of A Recession Ahead of the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement last week, Trump braced Americans for a possible recession. In a Fox News interview aired March 9, he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic \u201ctransition\u201d as his policies take hold and noting he\u2019s paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a \u201cdetox period.\u201d Bessent told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview he believes it \u201cwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes\u201d on ahead of the Great Recession. \u201cBe Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Monday. What Needs To Happen To Gdp To Trigger A Recession (it\u2019s Not Negative\u2014yet) The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns by calling for -1.8% annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter, which would be the worst reading since 2020\u2014though the estimate is likely skewed by its methodology, including how it accounts for a surge in gold imports. Bond Market Is Shaky\u2014but Yield Curve\u2019s Still Intact Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by 40 basis points over the past three months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed\u2019s bond-linked recession model calls for just 30% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession. Consumer Confidence Signals Americans Bracing For Tough Times Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans\u2019 conviction in the economy, as the Conference Board\u2019s closely watched consumer confidence survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2021. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released March 17 by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. Unemployment Rate Is Still Fine One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as March\u2019s 4.2% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. Gold And Oil Prices Hint At Potential Global Slowdown Trading in two of the world\u2019s most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,200 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. What To Watch For Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts \u201cuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,\u201d according to David Mericle, Goldman\u2019s chief U.S. economist.

The cuts have come at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency, the government overhaul initiative led by tech billionaire Elon Musk. DOGE has already fired tens of thousands of federal employees to shrink the size of government workforce. AP Trump and Musk undertook a sweeping campaign to cut the size of the 2.3 million-strong civilian U.S. government workforce Days after the US Supreme Court gave a greenlight to the Trump administration to fire 16,000 probationary federal employees, the federal agencies are bracing to present their plans for another round of mass firings. The deadline to submit the plan is Monday, reported NYT. This is the latest step by the Trump administration to shrink the government that figures to further reshape a civil service that has endured tens of thousands of departures. Trump's 'first buddy' and his tech billionaire ally Elon Musk is spearheading the watchdog agency, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The cuts have come at the direction of DOGE which aims to streamline federal government operations and slash costs. Thousands of employees already fired Trump and Musk undertook a sweeping campaign to cut the size of the 2.3 million-strong civilian U.S. government workforce. Nearly 200,000 employees have been fired or earmarked for termination or have accepted buyouts, as per a Reuters report. ALSO READ: $1,400 bonus coming? IRS deadline to claim stimulus check is tomorrow. Here's how you can do it Some agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, have already announced their layoffs for this round of dismissals, which follows the terminations in February of thousands of probationary federal employees. Live Events DOGE's aggressive effort has cast a pall over the federal workforce since Trump returned to the Oval Office. This week's plans for the mass firings, called \"reductions in force,\" should offer a clearer picture of the administration's vision of a downsized federal government. In recent days, thousands of federal employees have quit voluntarily or have accepted buyout offers. Many have accepted the offer to quit while temporarily being paid -- including more than 1,100 people at the National Park Service, a person familiar with the details told NYT. The incentive applied only in certain departments as Monday's deadline neared, and was originally pitched in January as a one-time offer.

According to a scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency, many have turned to news outlets to stay informed about the status of their positions. The lack of clarity surrounding resignation and early retirement offers has led some federal employees to seek guidance on social media about whether to accept them. Employees left in lurch Agency supervisors and managers have received little information about ongoing personnel changes ever January 20- the day when Trump returned to the White House. Many, according to a scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency, have had to rely on news reports to learn about their job status. With limited details provided about resignation and early retirement options, federal employees have turned to social media for guidance on what steps to take. Thousands of probationary employees who were terminated have been in limbo since mid-February. Initial court rulings that ordered their reinstatement were later overturned or paused. Some returning workers say they still haven\u2019t received clear answers from HR regarding their employment status or eligibility for deferred resignation.

Some employees discovered they had been fired only when their building access badges stopped working. In total, around 10,000 employees were laid off, with entire departments and programs being eliminated. The department did not offer the option of deferred resignations. Many of those laid off have reported inaccuracies in the official documentation regarding their service. Many fired workers from the department have said that the information about their service at the agency was inaccurate in the documents they received when they were laid off. The process for a reduction in force comes with specific steps that agencies must follow. As with other personnel actions, workers laid off in reductions of force must bring their challenges to the Merit System Protections Board, an independent administrative board that reviews employment decisions.

Leading American corporations are caught in the crossfire due to their heavy reliance on the Chinese market. Many American corporate giants, such as Apple and Tesla, depend on China as a primary manufacturing hub. This makes any trade restrictions or tariffs imposed on products manufactured in China a significant obstacle to profitability for these companies. Semiconductor companies have suffered a shocking setback after China halted exports of certain critical raw materials used in these industries. The consequences saw a sharp decline in stock prices, disruptions in supply chains, and loss of investor confidence in the stability of the U.S. market. Image: Donald Trump on the campaign trail in March 2016. Credit: Windover Way Photography A spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently published a satirical post revealing that the iconic red hat, MAGA, worn by President Trump during his election campaign was made in China. Beijing viewed this as clear evidence of the pervasive reach of Chinese manufacturing into all sectors of the American economy\u2014even the symbolic ones. While China is not immune to damage by the Trump tariff war, the impact on its economy will be less severe compared to the U.S. The Chinese market has several key factors that can defend against damages. Firstly, the Chinese people strongly support their government and stand behind its decisions to counter U.S. pressure. Secondly, China\u2019s leadership acts swiftly and decisively, granting it more political and economic maneuverability. Thirdly, China looks at this trade war as an opportunity to make changes to its global position. Although the U.S. is a superpower, the unity of the Chinese government with its people serves as a defense against the tariff attack initiated by Trump. Some analysts see the recent US policy trends as an attempt to change the global trade system. Trump may be charting a course correction of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). GATT and WTO have faced criticism that the current system lacks fairness in trade practices and is ineffective in dispute-resolution strategies. Trump\u2019s global trade war aims to protect strategic industries, bolster national security, and negotiate more substantial bilateral and regional agreements. The obstacles to Trump\u2019s plan include international resistance, and the punitive effects on the U.S. economy, which saw the stock market crash before Trump paused the tariffs, allowing for a somewhat recovery. The Trump plan lacks moderation, so it swings like a pendulum, not yet finding a happy medium. In 2023, U.S. exports to China totaled $154 billion, while imports from China reached $436 billion. Despite trade tensions, China remains the third-largest trading partner of the U.S., with American direct investments in China standing at $126.9 billion in 2023. Conversely, Chinese direct investments in the U.S. amounted to $28 billion in the same year. The trade between the U.S. and China is strategic to both country\u2019s economies and peoples. The two powerhouses depend on each other for success. Trump may be attempting to realign the previous imbalance between the two, but this is a complex and risky endeavor, and many economic experts view a trade war featuring tariffs as not the best vehicle for change. Trump\u2019s possible goal is to use the trade war and tariffs to push China to the negotiating table, where a new global trade order could be agreed upon. Trump may place high tariffs on other trading partners besides China to create new rules in the shifting global power dynamics. The changes may be necessary, but they face significant obstacles, such as a lack of trust between nations, conflicting priorities, and domestic political battles that could hold up consensus. A comprehensive global trade agreement that serves the interests of all parties will be a tall order to fill. Trump will likely continue in some form to effect a change in the global trade system, to level the playing field somewhat. It is not yet clear whether he would attempt a full dismantling of GATT or only a type of reform. It is clear that the interdependence between the U.S. and China is immense, and negotiations remain the most effective and fair path forward to address the imbalances. Professor Winter Nie is the regional director of Southeast Asia and Oceania for IMD Business School. Nie wrote an article published in Forbes in which Nie laid forth possible repercussions if Trump decided to fulfill a campaign promise of imposing tariffs on China. After Trump blindly began his promised trade war, he suffered the consequences, and ordered a 90-day pause on April 9, on all countries except China, which is now at 145%. The other countries will remain at 10% tariffs until July. On April 11, Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and some other electronic devices from \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports. Nie pointed out, the fastest-growing markets for laptop computers and cell phones made in China are India, Latin America and Africa. Chinese consumers bought 131 million iPhones by the end of 2015, but the U.S. customers only bought 110 million during the same period. China is expected to buy 6,810 airplanes over the next 20 years, and that order worth more than $1 trillion may go to Boeing in Seattle which employs 150,000 workers in Washington. In a trade war, the U.S. might blink first because the U.S. needs China more than Trump calculated. Many Trump voters shop at Walmart, which buys billions of cheap goods from China. When the prices they pay for goods at Walmart skyrocket, those MAGA supporters will be disillusioned and hurt economically. The higher prices would be a direct result of the Trump imposed tariffs. The world is captivated as China and the US spar in the Trump tariff-induced trade war. If the two sides do not reconcile their differences and cannot find a happy medium to balance their trade, both sides will feel isolated and that can be dangerous. Military action between China and the US might be provoked by the trade war unless peacefully resolved. Trump has flip-flopped since 2017 on the Taiwan question. At one point he was against the One-China policy, and then later embraced the official US position which dovetails with Beijing. However, in February, two dozen Republican lawmakers backed a resolution recognizing Taiwan, and they were hopeful of swaying Trump in their direction. The unexpected consequences of the Trump trade war against China might be war. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. John Sviokla covers GenAI/AI's impact on commerce and society. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 11:00am EDT Share Save Comment Technology Amplifies The Good And The Bad! Young man with closed eyes covering his ears. getty Entrepreneurs and using AI and Generative AI to make their businesses better. At the same time, it is important to remember generative AI, like all technologies, is an amplifier \u2013 making the good great and the mediocre, worse. A rigorous 2024 study of 640 entrepreneurs in Kenya, by academics from University of California Berkley and Harvard Business School showed that using an AI assistant improved the better entrepreneurs by 19% and the less successful entrepreneurs decreased their performance by 9%! See the graph below. This shows relative impact on business performance from the HBS/Berkley paper. Figure 3: Treatment Effects on Business Performance The technology provided by the researchers helped these entrepreneurs with a range of topics from financial management to agricultural advice, and changed their economic return. Likewise as I\u2019ve written in my Forbes column 3 Reasons to Consider AI Agents for Your Organization that generative AI can help lower the cost of innovation. I quote Chip Hazard a founding partner at Flybridge Ventures, an early stage VC saying that entrepreneurs are asking for significantly less capital to start their firms, and they are filling in the needed capacity using capital efficient AI. More broadly, Andrej Karpathi, one of the founders of OpenAI and a one time Direct of AI at Tesla, notes how large language models (LLM) have \u201c flipped the script \u201d on technology diffusion. He says that large and important technologies usually move from established organizations and governments to smaller firms, slowly. With LLMs he says the opposite is true. It\u2019s the startups that are benefiting and the larger firms (presumably except for the technology firms) lagging in adoption. So, how are these upstarts using AI? They are combining software as a service, that is things like Slack, Google Office, etc., and service as software, that is software-enabled expertise. Here\u2019s three ways folks are using AI to power their startups.

At my firm GAI Insights we have been calling clients and asking them to give us a question they would like an answer to. One was from Northeast Ohio and was curious about some of the permitting process for commercial real estate in a particular region, along with trend for commercial property in that area. The deep research robot came back with an in depth analysis. We then asked that individual to grade the report. He gave it an A-. When asked what would you have done to get the same information if you did not have this analysis \u2013 he said, he would have put a team of 2-3 analysts on it for 2-3 days. We have repeated this with a number of customers and no-one has graded the report lower than a B. This type of analysis which is critical both to the entrepreneur and to the investors can be expensive if one uses high quality talent or can take a long time to specify and get accomplished if one uses lower quality analysts. The LLMs provide a great first draft \u2013 as deep or deeper than many first drafts by a team. AI Lowers Indirect Costs Anyone who analyzes a legal contract today without the help of a large language model is wasting money. Of course, no one with a ounce of common sense would just use the output of a model for their final legal documents. But, if you do use these tools they make your interactions with attorneys much more productive \u2013 and a $1,000 conversation turns into a $200 one because you know what the document is about, and exactly what to ask the attorney. In other services, Truwind.ai has AI assisted accounting that provides more accurate, audited fast turn around accounting service. If you need to talk with a human accountant, that can be arranged too through their platform. AI Can Help In Getting Your Message Out 73% of consumers looking for a product prefer short form videos. Short form videos are one of the fastest, if not the fastest form of media consumption. The recent announcement by Google of Vertex AI environment has tools for speech, video, music and text \u2013 all together. Amazon announced an amazing new voice tool called Nova Sonic that is amazingly lifelike for any conversation. There are tools to ensure consistent brand representation across the different scenes and images. For $400 one can create a video that might have cost $400,000. This new visual language is being used inside and outside innovative firms today. Conclusion: Learn From The Grateful Dead In short, a larger amplifier will not make you a better guitar player. The great artists will garner a larger audience (as the Grateful Dead did when audio engineer and chemist Owsley Stanley created the famous \u201c wall of sound\u201d), but a bad guitarist will simply annoy the neighbors. Generative AI and AI are amplifiers of entrepreneurial talent, and a great leg up for the small firms of the world to compete with the big ones. It is like the special forces competing against the regular army. The regular army scales by giant pyramids of talent, and overwhelming mass. Special forces depend on highly trained individuals with great technology, cross trained in different tasks with a motto of best in front, on any task or issue. Likewise, smart startups of today are a hybrid meld of human and digital workers to get the job done faster, better, cheaper and with much more efficient use of capital and time.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder President Donald Trump has surprised many with his continued tolerance of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his White House despite the fact that his Department of Government Efficiency appears to falling well short of achieving its purported goals, opined Salon columnist Heather Digby Parton. Parton begins by acknowledging she didn't think that Trump would put up with Musk for long although \"as it turns out, Trump has quite liked having the richest man in the world at his beck and call and he even puts up with his precocious little son X, who likes to tell the president to shut up during press conferences.\u201d She then slammed Trump on giving Musk access to government computers because it allowed the South African native to \u201ctake a chainsaw to the executive branch for three months now, causing tremendous chaos and trauma and essentially destroying much of what the American people count on their government to do.\u201d ALSO READ: Wow!' MSNBC's Mika surprised after hearing Trump voters ripping his top economic policy The New York Times in a recent report has noted how Musk is not getting anything close to the $1 trillion in government savings that he initially promised when he founded DOGE, and the savings that Musk has claimed appear to be highly dubious substantively. Reading this Digby Parton surmised, \u201cIf DOGE's mission is to cut spending, Musk's doing a terrible job. If its job is to cause misery, it's a rousing success.' She also thinks Musk may live to regret his decisions given how much his actions have harmed sales at his flagship business. \u201cHe apparently didn't realize that by becoming a right-wing MAGA troll, he would alienate the people who buy his cars,\" she argued. \"There aren't a whole lot of EV buyers in rural America, home to the MAGA base.\u201d SmartNews For customer support contact support@rawstory.com .

Image : Kevin Dietsch / Scott Olson / Staff / Bulou.Varanisese / Kotaku ( Getty Images ) As we hurl ourselves as a species headfirst into the dystopian worlds of 1980s sci-fi movies, it seems only appropriate that we should see people responding to the tech-driven maelstrom by playing the role of vandal hackers. So it is that Silicon Valley crosswalks are currently playing satirical messages in the voices of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.

The voice\u2014either an impersonator or AI recreation\u2014continues, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcibly insert AI into every facet of your conscious experience. And I just want to assure you, you don\u2019t need to worry because there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. Anyway, see ya!\u201d NBC News It\u2019s a message that feels especially pertinent in the days following the enforced introduction of an entirely unwanted, impossible-to-remove AI button in Meta\u2019s WhatsApp. Advertisement Related Content Mark Zuckerberg Says He's Probably The Best Civilization Player In The World Elon Musk's Mom Can't Stop The Mark Zuckerberg Cage Fight In New Game Related Content Mark Zuckerberg Says He's Probably The Best Civilization Player In The World Elon Musk's Mom Can't Stop The Mark Zuckerberg Cage Fight In New Game \u201cFuck, I\u2019m so alone.\u201d Advertisement Another message that\u2019s been heard in multiple places is ostensibly spoken by unofficial U.S. vice president Elon Musk. \u201cHi, this is Elon Musk,\u201d the message begins. \u201cWelcome to Palo Alto, the home of Tesla engineering. You know, they say money can\u2019t buy you happiness...\u201d There\u2019s then a long pause, before the voice picks up again. \u201cAnd yeah, OK, I guess that\u2019s true\u2014God knows I\u2019ve tried. But it can buy a Cybertruck, and that\u2019s pretty sick, right? Fuck, I\u2019m so alone.\u201d Advertisement A third hack, also featuring a recreation or imitation of Musk\u2019s voice, makes a deliberately bad joke about cancer , which doesn\u2019t really land. According to NBC , it\u2019s not clear how the hacks occurred. Done on Friday, April 11, it took city officials a couple of days to become aware of them, allowing plenty of viral recordings to be made and enjoyed. The chief communications officer for the City of Palo Alto told NBC that the audio feature on the affected crosswalks has now been disabled, adding that it was only affecting a small number of crossings, and that \u201csignal operations are otherwise unaffected.\u201d Other crossings were hacked in Menlo Park and Redwood City, which were also fixed over the weekend. Advertisement This does seem like exactly the sort of tech-forward rebellion our newfound The Running Man reality demands. I hope those responsible had spikey green mohawks and wore bandana masks with skulls-and-crossbones printed on them, letting out a high-pitched cackle as they drove away on neon-covered motorbikes. .", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://kotaku.com/crosswalk-hack-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-ai-messages-1851776044", "source": "Kotaku", "published_at": "2025-04-14T14:50:00"}, {"id": 1017, "title": "Untitled", "content": "Untitled Why are fund managers so pessimistic on US stocks?

While the automaker regularly releases smaller updates, it sometimes bundles many features into the same update for a bigger release, like this one. It\u2019s important to note that while it\u2019s a significant update as a whole, many of these features are specific to certain vehicles and regions. Therefore, most Tesla owners won\u2019t get most of those features. Adaptive Headlights Now Available in US and Canada This is something that has been available in Europe for a while, but now Tesla is introducing it in its latest vehicles in North America: Advertisement - scroll for more content High beams adapt to reduce glare for other drivers and cyclists. By detecting other road users, and selectively dimming individual pixels of the headlight, your high beams stay on more often for greater visibility at night. If your Tesla is equipped with the necessary hardware (matrix headlights), you\u2019ll now see the toggle under Controls > Lights > Adaptive Headlights . Blind Spot Camera Moves to Driver Screen (Model S/X) The headline is pretty self-explanatory, and it looks like this on your driver display: Controls > Display > Automatic Blind Spot Camera & select Driver Screen This is only for the refreshed Model S/X (2021-2025). Dashcam/Sentry Mode Upgrade: More Cameras, Better Viewer For newer Model S, 3, X, and Y vehicles, Tesla is now including side camera (B-pillar) footage in Dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings, increasing the total recorded camera angles from four to six. Alongside that, the Dashcam Viewer app has been redesigned with a grid layout and quick-swipe video review tools. This has been a highly requested feature by Tesla owners, especially more recently amid increased occurrences of vandalism against Tesla vehicles. Smarter Road Trips: Alternative Trip Plans Tesla\u2019s Trip Planner has become more useful with now clearer choices for multiple routing styles: Fastest : minimize travel time Best Amenities : prioritize charging stops near top-rated restaurants, shops, and restrooms Fewer Stops : reduce the number of charging stops Top comment by KerrySkates Liked by 13 people Looks like a nothing burger for those of us with cars released before latest refreshed 3/Y. I\u2019m in a HW3 vehicle. The navigation updates are the most notable and actually useful feature. I would like to see an option for managing charging stop length. The \u201cfastest\u201d option might take that into account, but maybe I don\u2019t want any stops to take longer than 20 minutes. Still\u2026 the navigation updates here are great. The best update my Tesla could give me is the removal of the Elon Musk bug. That one has overstayed its welcome and is long overdue for being addressed. Here\u2019s hoping for a near-future update that solves that issue. View all comments Nearby attractions are also listed when viewing a Supercharger location. Cybertruck-Specific Updates The Cybertruck gains a pair of Autopilot-related upgrades: Comfort Drive Mode : now auto-engages when Autopilot is active Lane Departure Avoidance Assist : no longer just a warning\u2014now it can also gently steer to keep you in your lane When Tesla started delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, the software was far from completed, especially when it comes to Tesla\u2019s advanced driver assist features. The automaker has been gradually releasing updates to bring those features to the electric pickup truck. Other Notable Features Avoid Highways toggle added to Controls > Navigation Keep Accessory Power On : lets you continue using USB ports and phone chargers after exiting the car, as long as battery level is above 20% Keyboard Language Switching now supported on-screen Enhanced media experience , including: Filtered search by source Shuffle for Apple Music playlists with more than 100 songs Improved SiriusXM navigation Amazon Music Free sign-in support \u201cUp Next\u201d view in YouTube Music Auto hotspot connection when driving Add Electrek to your Google News feed.

Fortinet researchers discovered multiple malicious NPM packages that are used to target PayPal users. The packages were uploaded to the repository in early March by a threat actor known as tommyboy_h1 and tommyboy_h2 , and were used to steal PayPal credentials and hijack cryptocurrency transfers. \u201cUsing PayPal-related names helps these malicious packages avoid detection, making it easier for attackers to steal sensitive information. By including \u201cPayPal\u201d in the name of the malicious packages, such as oauth2-paypal and buttonfactoryserv-paypal, the attackers also create a false sense of legitimacy, tricking developers into installing them.\u201d reads the analysis published by Fortinet. \u201cThe code collects and exfiltrates system data, such as usernames and directory paths, which can then be used to target PayPal accounts or be sold for fraudulent purposes.\u201d Malicious NPM packages use a preinstall hook to run hidden scripts, steal system info, obfuscate data, and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers for future attacks. Fortinet researchers recommend watching for fake PayPal-related packages, checking network logs for odd connections, removing threats, updating credentials, and staying cautious when installing packages. The same attacker likely created the tommyboy_h1 and tommyboy_h2 malicious packages to target PayPal users. \u201cThe authors of tommyboy_h1 and tommyboy_h2 are likely the same person, publishing multiple malicious packages in a short time. We suspect that the same author created these packages to target PayPal users.\u201d concludes the report. \u201cWe urge the public to be cautious when downloading packages and to ensure they are from trusted sources to avoid falling victim to such attacks.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, malicious NPM packages) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malicious NPM packages PayPal Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Critical Apache Roller flaw allows to retain unauthorized access even after a password change Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Meta will use public EU user data to train its AI models Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Critical Apache Roller flaw allows to retain unauthorized access even after a password change Security / April 15, 2025 Meta will use public EU user data to train its AI models Digital ID / April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is betting not From meme stocks to bank accounts, how Robinhood is expanding its turf. by Nilay Patel Apr 14, 2025, 2:05 PM UTC Link Facebook Threads Nilay Patel is editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast , and co-host of The Vergecast . Today, I\u2019m talking with Vlad Tenev, the cofounder and CEO of Robinhood, which is one of the most well-known consumer finance apps in the world. It started as a way to open up stock trading, but the company\u2019s ambitions have grown over time \u2014 and they\u2019re getting even bigger. Just a day before Tenev and I talked, Robinhood announced it would soon be offering bank accounts and wealth management services, which would allow Robinhood to be involved with your money at every possible level. So I was interested to sit down with Tenev and really hash out where Robinhood is going and why he\u2019s so adamant that big ideas, like prediction markets based around everything from sports games to presidential elections, are going to play such a pivotal role in the future of finance. And I really wanted to talk about the responsibilities that come with that role. Robinhood is on a lot of people\u2019s phones \u2014 especially young men \u2014 and it\u2019s a quick jump from doing a little bit of casual retail investing to potentially dumping all your money into a bunch of unpredictable, unstable markets. There\u2019s a whole generation out there who might have bought a GameStop share as a joke during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now finding themselves consistently gambling in the crypto and prediction markets. Listen to Decoder , a show hosted by The Verge \u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here ! Tenev and I really dug into some of the complexity around these ideas. For example, you\u2019ll hear him say he thinks of prediction markets as \u201cthe news faster\u201d and that there is a meaningful difference between a prediction market guessing if the Lakers will win their next game and just simply placing a bet on DraftKings or FanDuel for the same outcome. You\u2019ll hear him say that prediction markets communicate unique information that reflects reality, rather than just a dressed-up version of gambling that mostly reflects how people feel. You will also hear my deep skepticism of these ideas. I really pressed Tenev for answers on how he thinks about the risks involved, especially for regular retail investors, and whether the regulatory environment can keep up with that escalating amount of risk. It\u2019s already causing problems: New Jersey and Nevada both ordered Robinhood to halt its prediction markets, and the company\u2019s partner Kalshi launched lawsuits to push back. You\u2019ll hear Tenev say that he has no firm idea where any of this might go, but that he fundamentally believes people should get to do whatever they want with their money \u2014 and that he wants to position Robinhood as a central destination for all of those transactions. That made me curious as to what Tenev sees as Robinhood\u2019s ultimate destination. So I asked him outright: does he think Robinhood is just selling an updated version of the American dream, where you can make the right wager on a prediction, buy the right stock, or invest in the right meme coin to shortcut your way to financial freedom? I won\u2019t spoil it, but I think you\u2019ll find his answer pretty illuminating. Like I said, you\u2019re going to hear us disagree quite a bit throughout this episode, but I want to give Tenev credit: he was game to really sit in some of the ambiguity and controversy here and talk about it in ways that many in the crypto and finance worlds simply aren\u2019t. I rather enjoyed this one, and I think you will, too. Okay: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Vlad Tenev, you are the co-founder and CEO of Robinhood. Welcome to Decoder . Thanks for having me, Nilay. I have so much to talk to you about. I think I have 900 pages of questions for you. There\u2019s a lot going on in financial services. You all just launched banking services. There\u2019s a lot going on in crypto. I know you\u2019re very interested in prediction markets. I have a million questions about that. So, if you\u2019re game, I\u2019d like to go through the Decoder questions about structure and decision making very fast at the top and then get to the rest. Are you okay with that? Yeah. I\u2019ll try to be brief. Because usually I do all this windup, but I think people know what Robinhood is, and I think your ideas about where it\u2019s going are really interesting. Let\u2019s just start with Robinhood. You founded it, then you were the co-CEO for a minute with your co-founder, Baiju Bhatt. He went to become the chief creative officer, you became sole CEO, and then he left the company. Just talk about that set of choices. That\u2019s a pattern we see in startups quite often. How did that all go down? Yeah, I think we technically started as co-CEOs as well, although in the early stages things are always a little bit murky. And then what happened was in the early days of the company, roles don\u2019t really matter because you\u2019re 10 people and you\u2019re all in one room and you\u2019re doing what\u2019s necessary to make the company win. We both didn\u2019t really have any concrete finance, business, or even technical skills when we started the company. We met in college. We were actually both physics majors at the time, and we were brought together by our love for physics. We wanted to seek to understand answers to the big questions like what happened before the Big Bang? Or my favorite one: how can we unify general relativity and quantum mechanics? That\u2019s how we became good friends; we were banging our heads against the wall trying to do problem sets in physics and math in college. Then we learned to build products and build businesses together. We were co-founders of a few companies before Robinhood. When we started Robinhood, we moved to San Francisco together. He became a designer. He literally bought a Wacom tablet and started designing. And I became an engineer. I still remember on the Caltrain ride from San Francisco down to Palo Alto, I would watch Paul Hagerty\u2019s iOS development classes at 2X speed, and that\u2019s how I learned to be an iOS engineer. So that was the division of labor; I was writing code, he was doing the designs. We built a team around that. Then we became managers, and then we became executives. I think at each point, we reassessed what we wanted to be spending our time on, how we could add the most value to the company. When it became clear that we\u2019re going to have executives and we\u2019re going to be a public company, Baiju made the decision that he didn\u2019t want to be the CEO of a public company \u2014 that didn\u2019t feel like how he wanted to spend his time and his energy. So he took the chief creative officer role, and then I think a couple years ago came to the decision that he wanted to go back to the original passion when we met , which was doing things with a more overt math and physics component. So he ended up starting another interesting company, Aetherflux, which aims to bring solar energy in a more efficient form down to Earth and targeting remote outposts and military locations where energy is sorely needed. So he went off to start that and is still a board member. As the company changes, I think we\u2019re pretty good at reevaluating our roles and what we want to spend time doing, and it was just an organic evolution over time. So much of our audience is people who build things and people who want to be founders, people who are at different stages of being a founder. I always say that no one ever talks about act two \u2014 going from managing people to being executives and managing managers. It seems like you have chosen you\u2019re going to be the eye of the storm of the public company that\u2019s changing how finance is done. Are you comfortable with that now? It\u2019s been several years; you\u2019ve been the CEO since 2020. Have you settled into that role? Well, I don\u2019t know. You can never be too comfortable. What I\u2019ll tell you is the things that I enjoy, do tend to align pretty well with being a public company and the activities of a public company CEO, like communicating the vision and figuring out how we can distill it in a simple form. I love the idea that institutional power and things that normally would\u2019ve been reserved for institutions are now, through technology, available to individuals. That\u2019s very much part of the genesis of Robinhood. It was all about individual participation in equity markets. As a public company, we allow individuals to participate in being shareholders of Robinhood in a much bigger way, and so we\u2019ve been doing all sorts of things to change what being a public company looks like. We were among the first to actually engage retail [investors] in a substantive way in our IPO. I think, to my knowledge, we were one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in terms of retail IPO allocation at the time. We let Robinhood customers through the Robinhood app participate in our own IPO. Then we bought a company called Say Technologies that does shareholder communications. If you\u2019ve listened to Tesla, Palantir, or Robinhood earnings calls, they take questions from retail via our Say Technologies platform. Last quarter, we did a live video earnings call. That was actually very cool. I think the inspiration was a post-game interview at an NBA game. We were like, \u201cThat\u2019s fun, what are the other settings where you have people that just went through something hard talking about it and it\u2019s enjoyable to watch?\u201d And I\u2019m an NBA fan and I actually look forward to the post-game interviews. I want to see what they\u2019re wearing. If it\u2019s a big loss, then I want to hear LeBron James talking about what they could have done better. It\u2019s also fun if they win. I think news, entertainment, financial services, sports to some degree\u2026 these are all merging over time, and they\u2019re part of our collective consciousness. I think retail investing is a big part of that. A big, enduring trend is power and capabilities that were formerly reserved for institutions going to the individual level. I think we can change a lot of things about what it\u2019s like being a public company participating in earnings calls. Traditionally, they were viewed as a chore and nobody really liked doing it, and it was considered B.S. that you have to deal with that was a cost, but I think it as an opportunity. I think if executed appropriately, it\u2019s another opportunity to get the message out. I enjoy doing that. I\u2019m still learning, and I don\u2019t have it figured out yet, but I think we can discover new things and being a public company definitely provides us opportunities to do different things that we wouldn\u2019t normally be able to do. I want to come back to that theme of what it\u2019s like to be the founder and CEO of a startup versus the public company CEO of what is now basically a bank. Those are different characters, and I\u2019m going to come back to that theme a few times throughout this conversation. How is Robinhood structured now? You\u2019ve had some changes, you\u2019ve had some layoffs over the past few years. How have you organized the company now? So we have a parent company, Robinhood Markets, Inc., and that\u2019s publicly traded. We have a number of subsidiaries and we typically organize the subsidiaries by business line, but now we also have international businesses, so we\u2019ve got some international subsidiaries. I\u2019ve got general managers who are basically CEOs in their own right that report to me that manage the business. Steve Quirk, who\u2019s our chief brokerage officer, is also the general manager of our brokerage business. He\u2019s got a couple of broker dealers that he oversees, like Robinhood Financial and Robinhood Securities, which is our clearing firm. We\u2019re essentially a vertically integrated brokerage business under Steve Quirk. Then we\u2019ve got Johann Kerbrat, who\u2019s our general manager of crypto. He runs our crypto business. Deepak Rao, who presented at the Gold event and runs Banking now and our credit card, he\u2019s the general manager of money. He\u2019s running his own PnL and business as well. Then we have a couple of GM\u2019s in different areas that are building businesses. JB Mackenzie runs futures and also prediction markets. He\u2019s got international brokerage responsibilities. There are a few others here and there, a few earlier stage efforts, but those are the big businesses. We also try to give full accountability, full responsibility, to our GMs so they have their own product resources. By and large, they have their own engineering resources as well. Although we have central platform engineering that builds the underlying technology for everything. Design and branding is more so centralized under me because I think it\u2019s important for all of our business lines to have a cohesive design language and also cohesive story when they communicate to the public. Those remain centralized, but most everything sits under the GMs. That\u2019s unusual for a startup of Robinhood\u2019s age. Most startups at this time are still pretty functional. Everything rolls up to the CEO. Have you structured the divisions in this way because of regulatory concerns, or because it\u2019s more efficient? The app is still the app. You express all of Robinhood to the user as one single app. Why have you broken out into divisions inside of that app? We do have multiple apps. We\u2019ve got a crypto wallet, which is a separate app, and banking is a separate app. Then there\u2019s the main Robinhood app and all of our trading and investment services are in that one. So we do have three apps, but you\u2019re right in that the GM divisions are not per app. GMs collaborate and share app services and I have a product leader that manages the core app. They\u2019re in charge of navigation and design of the overall experience. We try to solve it that way. But there\u2019s puts and takes with every org structure. When people are separated in divisions, as you say, then it becomes a little bit harder to find ownership over the core surface areas because that\u2019s not natural. And also, the tension points where they interact or where maybe they have different goals bubble up to me or to the core product team. We\u2019ve tried to engineer around that by making those tension points at least knowable and specific. We know it\u2019s going to be design, core app, and marketing. But yeah, the flip side is if everything\u2019s functional and you\u2019re rolling out multiple businesses, then nobody owns the PNL (profit-and-loss) of those businesses. If I ask someone, for example, \u201cWhy is options market share the way it is or options revenue?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve got the product. The product\u2019s great. The engineering is working according to spec.\u201d But the PnL accountability for all business lines would be me. There\u2019s not one person in that structure besides the person at the top that\u2019s living and breathing and losing sleep over the business results of what they\u2019re working on, which is, I think, a flaw. At least for us, which is a multi-product line, multiple entity business, I think it\u2019s worked really, really well. We made that transition in 2022, and I think since that point, the results have become apparent. I think all the GMs feel huge accountability and responsibility over their entire businesses. They have more ownership. They love it, and I think we\u2019ve been executing really, really fast. It\u2019s worked very, very well for us, but not without risks that have to be managed. I think there is a nice thing about it being aligned with the regulatory structure. We\u2019re regulated. We have lots of regulated businesses. Each of them have different licenses. A lot of the time, the regulations stipulate that the business needs to have a president with actual authority, a chief compliance officer, and so aligning the regulatory structure to how we operate very, very closely just reduces complexity. I think in a functional structure, you have to fight against that and compensate for that to some degree. Other people have strong feelings about actually hiding the regulatory structure from users and absorbing that complexity as an organization. But I think if you can figure out how to align with it and actually use it effectively, it saves time and streamlines things so that we\u2019ve embraced it rather than fought against it. The structure question is the big Decoder question. The other one I always ask everybody is how do you make decisions? What\u2019s your framework? I would say I operate at opposite ends of the spectrum. On the one hand, I\u2019m a math and physics person. I love data, I love numbers. I\u2019m very quantitative. I like digging into the details and breaking things into constituent bits; I\u2019m reductionist in that way. One of the values that we have is first principles thinking. I\u2019m generally allergic to thinking by analogy. \u201cOh, this is the way it worked at E-Trade,\u201d for example. When I hear something like that, I immediately get skeptical. I don\u2019t love reasoning by analogy. I don\u2019t like doing things just because others have done them that way. We have this saying, \u201cWe only follow the crowd when they\u2019re right.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be contrarian for the sake of being contrarian either. I think that\u2019s silly. But the ultimate thing is \u201cis it right?\u201d And we\u2019ll follow the crowd if they\u2019re right. If they\u2019re wrong, we\u2019ll gladly go against them. That\u2019s one side. I think the other side is I\u2019m also incredibly comfortable just doing things based on gut feel. I think you need that in order to actually push design forward, because design by its very nature is not super quantitative. A good design is opinionated, which means you\u2019ll piss people off who disagree with it. I have no problem with that. I\u2019d like to say the endpoints are important. It\u2019s good to make some decisions intuitively based on gut feel, others quantitatively, and generally the middle takes care of itself. Let\u2019s put some of that into practice. You\u2019re big on prediction markets. I know you have a lot of thoughts there. I\u2019m eager to dig into them. This is the rare Decoder where there\u2019s breaking news on this show that is nominally about org charts. Just before you came on to tape with us here on Friday, March 28th, the New Jersey Department of Gaming Enforcement, which calls itself Nudge (NJDGE), asked you to halt bets in New Jersey , on prediction markets on March Madness specifically. I\u2019m just going to read the quote: \u201cThis activity constitutes a violation in New Jersey sports wagering acts. Which only permits licensed entities to offer sports wagering to New Jersey residents on collegiate sports events occurring in New Jersey.\u201d It\u2019s similar in Nevada. The quote from the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board: \u201cEvery sports pool in Nevada must undergo an extensive investigation prior to licensing.\u201d Massachusetts is also investigating this. You\u2019ve halted trading in New Jersey, you\u2019re complying with the cease and desist there. It\u2019s a big decision to go launch in these markets when you know that there\u2019s an enforcement authority, particularly in New Jersey and Nevada where they have casinos at scale. Why make that decision? Why not go to them first and say, \u201cAre we in compliance?\u201d This is sort of new ground. If you think about the history of how this came about, Kalshi had a big lawsuit. Kalshi\u2019s your partner on prediction markets. Yeah. For prediction markets we\u2019re operating under the CFTC regime, which is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They regulate futures and swaps, and prediction markets falls under that purview. We registered to be a futures commission\u2019s merchant, which is basically the equivalent of a broker, but in CFTC land. And companies like Kalshi, which we partner with for these particular contracts, also ForecasteX, which we partnered with for the presidential election prediction market last year, they\u2019re called designated contract markets (DCMs). They\u2019re like the exchange to our broker. With all prediction markets, since we\u2019re not a designated contract market, we rely on the DCMs to list contracts. And once it\u2019s listed by a DCM, which again is the exchange in CFTC land, we can list them on our platform. Our view is we want to list all prediction markets. We believe that they have societal value in addition to any value they have as a trading asset for our traders. We think they\u2019re a better source of information. Obviously the line between prediction markets and what should be federally CFTC regulated and what should be under the purview of states who have gaming \u2014 which is regulated and taxed at a state level \u2014 that line is going to be debated right now. I think Robinhood\u2019s a big part of that because we believe in prediction markets. That\u2019s the intersection here, particularly with sports. While we believe that these are CFTC regulated products, we also recognize that this issue has to be debated and worked out, and it\u2019s not very, very clear. For that reason, we decided to respect the state of New Jersey\u2019s demand to halt operations for its citizens , even though we disagree with it. We\u2019re going to work it out over the next couple of months. We\u2019ll be in conversations. But as you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of states \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people, a lot of counter parties \u2014 that could take issue with various aspects of it. And a lot of established interests are at play here. I think this is going to be an interesting area to watch. But I do believe prediction markets are the future, and they have societal value across all categories. Were you ready for this? When you launched it, did you know a bunch of states are going to get mad and we might have to geolocate our services or halt them in certain states? Well, we launched without Nevada, as you know. Yeah, of course we built the capabilities of that, as we have in the traditional non-prediction markets business. Crypto also has a state by state component to it. For example, in New York, we don\u2019t offer crypto transfers. You can\u2019t transfer in and out. There\u2019s differences between the coins that are available on a state level. Up until recently, we weren\u2019t in all 50 states. It\u2019s nothing new to us. There\u2019s a state component to everything that we do. But were you expecting New Jersey to show up and say, \u201cTurn this off until we deal with it\u201d? I don\u2019t know if we were expecting New Jersey in particular, but obviously it\u2019s not a surprise that if we\u2019re in this new area where states have vested interests to make sure that it\u2019s state regulated that they would have concerns. The argument that you\u2019re getting at is the difference between a prediction market and gambling. But straightforwardly, that is what is happening here. The states are saying, \u201cWe regulate gambling in our states. You pay taxes, we have revenue. We want to protect our citizens. This looks an awful lot like gambling. Go ahead and stop.\u201d I would offer you the opposite argument. I know a lot of people who believe the markets are gambling, that merely investing in the stock market, or meme coins and meme stocks, is a kind of gambling that has taken place because it has been democratized by apps like Robinhood and even E-Trade before it. I see the difference there very clearly. In the stock market, you should be able to look at the fundamentals of some company or its earning reports and you should be able to derive some secondary value. \u201cI understand what this company is doing, I understand how much money it\u2019s making, how much money it\u2019s losing, where it\u2019s investing, what its opportunity is. I can draw some line to its future stock capability.\u201d That is the most important thing that undergirds the market. That\u2019s the argument against \u201cthe market is gambling.\u201d There\u2019s some mathematical reality there. What is that same argument for a prediction market on sports? Because you can\u2019t go look at the Lakers and say, \u201cWell, LeBron\u2019s there, so they\u2019re definitely going to win every game.\u201d That\u2019s just not how it works. You\u2019re making a valid point. I think the line between gaming and gambling and finance is a debated thing. There\u2019s people that will go on Twitter and say, \u201cAnytime you\u2019re taking a risk, it\u2019s a form of gambling.\u201d I think the term is not properly defined and specifically defined, which I think adds to the confusion. And in particular when you deal with derivatives markets, which I think prediction markets are a subset of the overall derivatives market space, there\u2019s several types of market participants. There\u2019s folks that are coming into a market to hedge, and if you\u2019re a farmer, then you\u2019re sensitive to crop yields and rain and weather and all sorts of things. One of the original use cases was for these derivatives markets to apply to farmers for them to hedge their exposure so they can smooth out their returns and their risk over time. And actually, I think for these types of historical reasons, the CFTC and these derivatives markets are overseen by the Senate Agriculture Committee [specifically the U.S. Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodities, Derivatives, Risk Management, and Trade], which is a weird historical fact. And now crypto being in there has a side effect of Senate Agriculture overseeing crypto. But yeah, it\u2019s the historical reason of futures and derivatives being especially valuable to farmers. You have hedging, which is one use case, but you also have speculation. Speculation is people just making predictions on what the price is going to be in the future. Without the speculators, it\u2019s not an effective market for hedgers because you can\u2019t just have people taking the opposite view of what\u2019s going on in reality because then it won\u2019t be an effective hedge, so you need the speculators to be in there speculating in order for the market to be liquid. Then you also have arbitrageurs. And arbitrageurs, which is how I began my career as a trader, just look at all markets and, using technology, compress the prices. If you have the same thing trading in two different places, you just buy it where it\u2019s cheaper, sell it where it\u2019s most expensive, and eventually the prices converge. These are the three types of participants necessary to make any derivatives market work. And so now your question is if you look at folks that are speculating, is there a difference between speculation and gambling? Let me make that question more specific just based on your example. My father-in-law is a farmer. I married a farmer\u2019s daughter. The utility of him being able to hedge is very clear. Yes, it\u2019s historical and, yes, now the regulatory scheme has this quirk of the [Senate Agriculture Committees] overseeing the derivatives market, but we all still got to eat, right? Yep. The farmers have to stay in business. The utility of that remains exactly the same as it was when these regulations were initially passed. And then you need to do some market making. You need to have the speculators and the people doing arbitrage in order to create the market for the hedging. But the utility of that for the farmer and then downstream of the farmer, us literally filling our plates, is obvious. What is the utility of that for sports? For the Lakers. Are you trying to hedge against the risk of losing for the Los Angeles Lakers? I\u2019ll tell you that sports is a big industry in the US. There\u2019s lots and lots of different types of businesses that rely on sports and the sports industry economically. And it\u2019s gotten much bigger. It\u2019s not just like fans, but sports betting, since that\u2019s been legalized, has just grown to tens of billions of dollars. And it\u2019s still much smaller than what it would be in Europe. Do you think that\u2019s good? Do you think sports betting is good? Do I think it\u2019s good? My view is people should be allowed to do what they want with their money. Yeah, I think that markets are good, generally individual accountability is important. There\u2019s folks that trade very, very actively and process lots of information and actually are quite scientific about taking advantage of mispricings. And as a former arbitrageur, I do think that that has value. I want to get away from actually trying to judge every contract on an individual level because I think you can get into trouble. Of course, maybe I can come and give you examples of contracts that I don\u2019t think are great and I wouldn\u2019t trade personally, but I think prediction markets does have significant societal value. It\u2019s an evolution of what the newspaper served in the past. You have the front page, which is events that people want information about that are trending right now, then you have the business section, arts and leisure, style, and of course you have sports. And the newspaper obviously had value. People were paying for it after the fact. Prediction markets actually give you that news faster; in some cases before it even happens. I think it certainly has enormous economic value. I view sports as a subset. It\u2019s one of the categories of information and news that people really, really care about. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so interesting to people and people are going to want to protect their purview over that domain. But yeah, I would distinguish prediction markets from gambling in that way. I have mixed feelings obviously about gambling in general, but prediction markets I\u2019m a big believer in. When I said I had 900 pages of questions, by the way, that thing you said about information, that\u2019s 850 of those pages. We\u2019re going to get into that. But I just want to stay on this for one more second. What specifically to the user, as expressed in your app, is different from betting on sports versus buying a contract in a prediction market? Because I looked at Robinhood today, and I understand there\u2019s some difference and there\u2019s some vocabulary differences, but what I saw was I\u2019m looking at March Madness, and if I pay 80 cents for a contract and this team wins, I\u2019ll get $1. And that feels a lot like betting. It was Auburn, by the way. I don\u2019t know if they won or not. Yeah, they\u2019re the No. 1 seed. Traditional sports betting, let\u2019s say digital sports betting, not even on-premise stuff, there\u2019s a house. That means that when you enter a bet, you\u2019re basically betting against the house, and with that comes all of the negative effects. There\u2019s no market, the house is just giving odds. There\u2019s a line. They\u2019re setting the line, and if you win too much, you get kicked off the platform, which is unfortunate. In most cases, once you\u2019re locked in, you can\u2019t get out of your bet. Because this is a market, there\u2019s no house. Buyers and sellers are meeting directly in an exchange. We\u2019re crossing orders, which facilitates price discovery. Since there\u2019s no one setting the line, the market sets the line. It becomes a more effective prediction, and from the user standpoint, the spread gets tighter because, for a variety of reasons, price discovery leads to tightening of spreads. I think that\u2019s the major thing. There\u2019s no house. Buyers and sellers meet. You can get out of a position during a game, which at [sports] betting platforms is not a commonly offered feature. It\u2019s very similar. You get all the benefits and the power and the rigor of financial markets. But just at the base level, some 20-year-old kid downloads this app and they want to wager on March Madness, the technical implementation of \u201cput in some money and get some money out if the team you\u2019ve predicted to win, wins\u201d is different. And I think the regulatory approach you\u2019re taking is different. You\u2019re saying these are effectively derivatives contracts and you should be regulated differently because it\u2019s not traditional gambling. But the effect on the user is the same. The reason we regulate gambling is because it has bad collective effects in society. People can get addicted to it; they throw their savings away. There\u2019s a lot of reasons outside of the technical implementation of \u201cthe house sets a line and can move against you.\u201d There\u2019s reasons that we regulate it. Do you think those reasons are applicable to what you\u2019re doing with derivatives contracts? Because I look at it from the user pushing a button, and the button says, \u201cIf they win, you get money,\u201d and the technical implementation of that doesn\u2019t really matter. I think some of those reasons are applicable. A lot of the origins of the state-by-state regulations come from a world where you actually had physical places where you would go. And so these turning into digital platforms in and of itself, not even CFTC but also state-regulated gambling, are new things. I think the regulations have to evolve either way. But yeah, certainly we want to make sure that suitability and all of those checks are followed through. And I think actually the traditional financial markets, futures markets are highly regulated. You do KYC (Know Your Customer regulations), you do monitoring and surveillance. There are suitability checks that make sure people really know what they\u2019re getting into and they have to self-certify. And I think that\u2019s a benefit for prediction markets being in the CFTC regime because you have high standards. Saying that these are financial markets isn\u2019t, in my opinion, a lowering of standards in any way, I think it\u2019s a heightening of standards. Well, the standards don\u2019t exist yet, as applied to this specific thing. The standards exist abstractly for derivatives markets, and now we have to apply them to this behavior. And at least some states are saying, \u201cActually, this just looks like gambling to us.\u201d Yeah, but what I\u2019m saying is CFTC-regulated markets are highly regulated. It\u2019s not accurate to say that there are no standards, because we\u2019re following the CFTC standards, which are very rigorous. One of the things I worry about with our audience, we have a lot of young men who listen to the show, and who read The Verge , is a sense that these types of markets \u2014 whether it\u2019s crypto, the regular stock market, derivatives, prediction markets, or just FanDuel \u2014 are a quicker path to riches than regular work. There\u2019s a sense that we\u2019re replacing the American dream with a very financialized secondary market economy. Is that how you want people to perceive Robinhood, that this is the future of the American dream? Yeah, I did write an article , back in I think it was 2021, about how the American dream itself as a concept has evolved. It used to be very tied to homeownership. You\u2019d buy a house, you\u2019d get a 30-year fixed mortgage, and that was the American dream, and that\u2019s actually not ideal from an investment standpoint. The amount of interest in fees you\u2019re paying on that, if you view it from an investment standpoint, is actually incredibly high. If you\u2019re going into U.S. equities \u2014 which are now commission-free and very, very low cost \u2014 that the American dream should perhaps evolve towards U.S. equities. I didn\u2019t make the claim that it should be crypto and derivatives or all of these things. And in fact, a couple of days ago, we actually crossed the bridge from being a purely self-directed platform into offering investment advice with Robinhood Strategies . If you look at the asset allocations of the portfolios there, it\u2019s very much listed equities and ETFs. And then if you actually look at what we incentivize as business, what we\u2019re giving matches for, it\u2019s things like retirement where you get a 3% match on contributions. I think I would distinguish between what the right way to invest is for the bulk of your money, which I do think for most people that have income and assets should be passively managed. But also, I do think people that have the income and can passively manage a portion of it, I don\u2019t think it should all be passively managed, I think there is a room in your portfolio for every person for it to be actively managed. That could be in things that you have high conviction in, whether it\u2019s individual stocks, cryptocurrencies, or options. If you\u2019re at a startup, you implicitly have high conviction and lots of concentration in the company that you\u2019re actually working for. And if you consider yourself an expert in an industry or even in sports, I think the derivatives markets live in that bucket. But yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say if you look at Robinhood, the actual mission and the future vision is for us to manage every dollar. I don\u2019t think every dollar should be in derivatives markets; probably a small portion of them. But the reality is people bet on sports, people engage in derivatives trading, and that\u2019s money that\u2019s leaving Robinhood accounts. If we can serve all of those dollars with our platform in a seamless and easy way at the lowest possible cost and the best user experience, then we\u2019ll have full wallet share with our customers across multiple generations. I think we could both add value and build a significant and important company that way. \u201cWallet share of our customers across generations,\u201d is an all-time Decoder phrase. I thank you for it. It\u2019s going on the wall. Let me ask about information and risk. What you\u2019re describing is a spectrum of risk. You\u2019ve got your new bank accounts, you\u2019re paying people, what, a 4.5% yield \u2014 that\u2019s low risk. That\u2019s just your bank. All the way on the other hand, you\u2019ve got prediction markets for sports, which are maybe the most risky thing you can do. And then in the middle, you\u2019ve got your thesis about information. Prediction markets are this new source of information. The thing that gets me is when you make prediction markets, the value of the information skyrockets, and then you have a lot of incentive. You\u2019ve created an enormous incentive to affect the outcome. In the best case, you work at a startup, you\u2019ve got stock in the startup. You have a huge incentive to affect the outcome positively. The company will be a success. You\u2019re going to work really hard. You\u2019re going to make a lot of money. I look at the NFL, for example. I\u2019m a big NFL fan. The amount of time we now spend talking about referees in the NFL officiating because of gambling has gone up. The notion that the league is scripted and that the games are rigged because any individual referee can make one penalty call at the end of the game and shift the outcome is skyrocketed because of the inclusion of gambling by the NFL into the product itself. That feels like a bad outcome to create all of these incentives to shift the outcome without any regard for the quality of the outcome itself. How do you manage the prediction markets against that incentive? Because I see that as totally distorting and in most cases negative. Yeah, I think that\u2019s a great question. And that\u2019s one of the areas where the traditional financial system already has lots and lots of infrastructure because we\u2019ve faced this problem for decades. You have insider trading rules and regulations, and it\u2019s very analogous to a company insider using proprietary information for their own benefit to make money in financial markets. That very much exists. There\u2019s also general anti-fraud protections that go into place when you\u2019re not dealing with securities. If you remember, Coinbase had a case a couple of years ago with the DOJ and what they found was that some employees used knowledge of forthcoming listings. I think it was some meme coins, they bought those meme coins because they knew that they were going to be listed and made a bunch of money. And of course, this was caught and tracked by surveillance and they got in a lot of trouble. I think generally the same principles apply. Sure, but how does that track with your sense that this is the new source of information? Because the information only enters the market if people have it and they begin trading on it. If you want to outlaw insider information, you have to prevent people who have that information from trading on it. How does that get into the prediction market? Yeah, basically individuals who have proprietary information shouldn\u2019t participate in the prediction markets, and all of the DCMs basically have rules against this. Because we know who\u2019s making the trades, everyone has to be KYC\u2019d (know your customer) at regulated DCM / FCM (futures commission merchant)-regulated prediction markets, we have the capabilities of identifying abuse. And of course all of these rules can evolve over time. If there\u2019s new vectors for abuse as the markets expand, there\u2019s mechanisms for those to be incorporated and to become new rulemaking. Hopefully the rules should evolve, as with any system. And if there\u2019s new vectors coming in, then we can evolve the rules to account for those. But I\u2019m actually not sure if there are new vectors that aren\u2019t accounted for by the existing rules. And I think this is one of those things where because the state regulatory regimes haven\u2019t really accounted for this, they may be less well positioned to oversee abuse than the federal level. Where does the information come from then? If I\u2019m looking at a prediction market on Robinhood and the line moves sharply, that\u2019s the information you\u2019re talking about. This is the new source of information. You\u2019re going to get it before the news gets it, or the traditional media gets it. You\u2019re going to watch that line move and you know something happened before everyone else knows it happened. How do you get from that second order effect \u2014 the line moved, people started moving their money against some new information \u2014 to the information itself? In the same way it happens in financial markets. You have sophisticated participants. Some of them are retail, many are institutional that actually make sense of all of the data that\u2019s coming in real time and actually crunch the numbers and see what it means. And a lot of this is happening using automated computing methods. They\u2019re crunching all of the data. But yeah, you can think of it as, let\u2019s say you\u2019re watching the news on election night and you\u2019re getting all of this polling data and all the early returns from the polls, and they\u2019re telling you Ohio results just came in, and there\u2019s this many voters in Ohio out of this many that are reported. There\u2019s a process by which you take that and actually price what the likely outcome of the election is. And so the people that are really good and fast at doing that have an opportunity for profit. That opportunity for profit isn\u2019t the information itself, though. That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. I\u2019ve heard you say the information line before. You said it to my friends, Casey Newton and Kevin Roose, on the podcast Hard Fork . You said you\u2019re going to get information before it happens. That prediction markets are not just the future of trading, but also information. What prediction markets are \u201cis the news faster.\u201d But here, you\u2019re saying prediction markets are reacting to the news, they\u2019re reacting to information. If you\u2019re a regular Robinhood investor and you\u2019re looking at the line move, how do you get back to, \u201cOkay, the smart money made some decisions. The smart money is watching Harry Enten say on CNN, \u2018Here are where the votes are,\u2019 and now I\u2019m repricing the contract? That\u2019s not the news, that\u2019s a derivative of the news. Yeah, I guess this is also an area where there\u2019s ambiguity in what we\u2019re saying. I think traditionally what I would say about the news, about the election, is when the news networks call. \u201cElection news\u201d is probably when CNN, MSNBC, NBC and all those networks say, \u201cOkay, Donald Trump\u2019s the winner of the election.\u201d That happened the next day in the vast majority of cases. The news of who won the election hit next day, but the prediction markets priced Trump at 95/5 within a few hours of the polls opening. I would call that knowing the news before it happened. If you were paying attention to the prediction markets, you knew what the outcome of the election was within some band of error. But I\u2019d say 95/5 is pretty good, right? At that point. Right. The difference for the media outlets is they can\u2019t be wrong. Or at least when they\u2019re wrong, there are consequences for them being wrong. They lose their credibility or they have to issue retractions or, I don\u2019t know, Trump sends them all to El Salvador or whatever he wants to do. There\u2019s not a consequence if you trust the prediction market and it gets it wrong. The consequence is you lose money. How do you think about that accountability? Well, I think that accountability is only part of the story. I think the other part is that there\u2019s an incentive to keep viewers glued and entertained. And you want them to watch for longer, so you don\u2019t want to just be like, \u201cOh, the election\u2019s over. Everyone can go back to what they\u2019re doing.\u201d They have an incentive to actually prolong it and say, \u201cHey, it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game. Anything can happen. Keep watching.\u201d And it\u2019s the same thing for sporting events, actually. I remember I was watching the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight. And that wasn\u2019t available in the U.S.-based prediction markets, but I opened up Polymarket to just view what was going on. I think by the second round, the prediction markets had it quite clear: it was 90/10 for Jake Paul. But if you listen to the announcers, it was, \u201cOh, all Mike needs is just one punch,\u201d or, \u201cHe just needs to hold out a little bit longer.\u201d It\u2019s like they made it sound like it was 50/50. You didn\u2019t know the outcome of that fight before it started? I knew the outcome of that fight before it started. I know why lots and lots of people that were betting on it did bet on Paul, and they knew why the fight was stretched out the way it was. And that\u2019s the danger. What you are describing is the danger. Here\u2019s this totally synthetic event that we\u2019re going to make people pay for and then have people bet on, and then everyone will believe at the end that it was rigged. The announcers have nothing to do with it, it\u2019s the distorting factor of the gambling that occurred around it that made everyone think, \u201cOh, this is totally rigged.\u201d Both Mike Tyson and Jake Paul got a lot of money for participating in this thing that most people believe was a sham, and they had a lot of incentive for the outcome to be made a little bit longer, right? Make it feel like this isn\u2019t totally a joke. Everyone knows that that\u2019s what happened. Or at least they perceive that they know. And that\u2019s the distortion that I worry about. I don\u2019t have any details about that, but my point really was, I think to your question, I don\u2019t think the only incentive is for the media to get it right, I think the incentive is actually to have people watching longer, which sometimes conflicts with giving you the information as quickly as possible. I think you have to agree that that\u2019s the incentive. I think platonically, yes, the media is held to a very high standard; you have to get it right. We\u2019d like to think that everyone is working with that in mind, but there\u2019s also a strong incentive to maximize viewership, to maximize time spent versus other networks. Because if you don\u2019t do that as a media enterprise, eventually you\u2019re drained of resources and you die. And I think sometimes that incentive actually can contradict with getting you the absolute truthful information as quickly as possible. Yeah, I work in the media, I would say there\u2019s an equal incentive to be first. That is equally damaging. As somebody who runs this race every day, that\u2019s equally distorting. But then on the flip side, I would say it\u2019s also not working, right? The media is losing jobs and it is dying and it is falling in relevance. There\u2019s a lot of reasons for that that I don\u2019t think have anything to do with stretching out the information. But what I just keep coming back to is the incentive to change the outcome by allowing people to have a financial stake in it seems very, very distorting, and there might be some rules against it. The NFL does injury reports because getting access to injury reports early was helping gamblers , and the NFL wanted to tamp down on that, and that\u2019s the history of the injury report. I get it. We\u2019re doing transparency. We\u2019re doing regulation around this stuff to try to control it. But here it seems like the regulatory regime is new where you\u2019re trying to fit a behavior into a regulatory regime that wasn\u2019t built for it from the start and you\u2019ve got a lot of young people taking part in this behavior who believe now that everything is rigged, that the world is a casino of this kind. This is what I was going to ask about. That seems like that\u2019s where you have to make the turn from startup founder with a disruptive idea to, \u201cI am the CEO of a bank.\u201d The responsibility rests with you. And I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re shouldering that burden. Because once you have the bank accounts and you can move it into the highest risk category, that\u2019s a big deal. Yeah, I think that is a criticism for sure. I think in a more precise form, it\u2019s basically do you want your betting in the same app as your bank account? Can these things coexist under the same platform? I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the highest order criticism because if you think about it, all these things are on your phone, and so it\u2019s fairly straightforward. And now everything can link to your bank account anyway. If you had a DraftKings account, you could link your DraftKings to your bank account pretty easily and move money back and forth. We get into this, well, but should they be separate apps? Should they be separate brands? Do we want the same thing? But the reality of it is everything\u2019s on your phone. It\u2019s all your phone. It\u2019s pretty easy to just go to the home screen, tap a button, and go from one service to the other. I actually don\u2019t think that criticism is higher order. Basically, it\u2019s just a completely meaningless decision. It\u2019s a business decision. It\u2019s like where do customers want it most? Because if they want it in the same app, functionally there\u2019s no difference between it being in the same app and being in a completely different brand elsewhere on your phone. Because the difference between going from one to the other is three seconds instead of two. There have been some good reasons in the past to separate these at the corporate level. And I hear you that it\u2019s pretty easy to just move money into FanDuel. But there was the Great Depression, and then we did Glass-Steagall , and we said the investments and the banks have to be farther apart. Then we allowed them to get closer together, and we had the 2008 financial crisis, and then we moved them slightly farther apart. And now you\u2019re saying, \u201cLook, because of phones, this distinction is meaningless,\u201d but history suggests that bad things happen when you let investments in banking get closer together. Well, that\u2019s for safety and soundness reasons. You don\u2019t want the same organization to be over leveraged and to take proprietary risk with their capital when they\u2019re also supposed to be safeguarding that capital. But we\u2019re not taking proprietary risks because we\u2019re just a broker routing orders to a marketplace where buyers and sellers interact, so the safety and soundness concerns that you\u2019d want to separate proprietary trading from retail banking don\u2019t apply in this case. Don\u2019t the concerns apply to the individual consumer, though, who is less sophisticated than banks, which often get themselves in trouble? Well, again, that\u2019s the point of the individual has money. They have a bank account. They\u2019re moving things to different accounts. It\u2019s the same thing from their perspective. It doesn\u2019t affect them whether those accounts are at different entities or one, barring safety and soundness concerns that are entity concentration, which don\u2019t apply in this case. Would you accept a regulation that said when you open the Robinhood banking app that you were prohibited from advertising or marketing the derivatives products in the Robinhood app themselves? Possibly, yeah. I haven\u2019t thought about that. I don\u2019t think we should accept new regulations lightly in any sense, but I\u2019m certainly a believer in regulation. I run many highly regulated businesses. Yeah, I don\u2019t want to just be glib about it and say, \u201cOh, that sounds like a good one.\u201d You\u2019d have to look at the pros versus the cons deeply. I generally think that we get into trouble by having lots of regulations. We don\u2019t have mechanisms to remove them. Once it\u2019s added, you just keep building this giant, thick underbrush of regulations and nobody ever wants to remove them. And then now we\u2019re in a situation where, as a country, we\u2019re looking around and saying, \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d We can\u2019t do anything anymore. You can\u2019t build a bridge. You can\u2019t trade crypto. And yeah, I think that\u2019s a problem. I think I generally agree with some variant of for every one you add, you should probably remove one because things change and the regulations, to a large extent, don\u2019t make sense. I\u2019ll give you another example: accredited investors. This is probably one that maybe you\u2019d agree with even because it\u2019s less controversial. But accredited investor rules basically stipulate that you can\u2019t be investing in OpenAI or SpaceX unless you\u2019re accredited because of some variant of \u201cthey\u2019re too risky.\u201d And why are they too risky? Back in the day when these regulations were created, it was hard to get information. There were no prediction markets, there wasn\u2019t the internet. There was a lot of murkiness. And maybe the wealthy folks had access to information and enhanced due diligence, normal people didn\u2019t so we have accredited investor rules. Now we\u2019re in a situation where meme coins are fine. You can put all of your money, anything you want in meme coins, sports betting, whatever have you, but OpenAI or SpaceX, companies like that are too risky. I think those cannot stand. As you can probably tell from our conversation, I don\u2019t think we should ban trading in meme coins and sports betting; people should generally be allowed to do what they want with their money. And so I think the accredited investor rules need a complete reboot and probably something closer to self-certification and some requirements for brokers and platforms like ourselves to put these things into buckets based on how much disclosure they have. Maybe if you\u2019re an early stage startup and there\u2019s no disclosure, we have to put a skull and crossbones in red and tell you, \u201cThis is an incredibly risky thing. You could lose 100 percent of your money.\u201d But yeah, I think the status quo needs a serious reboot. I just had the idea of Sam Altman doing a meme coin to fund OpenAI\u2019s expansion. It seems more likely than not. Let me ask you about crypto, just to wrap up here. I have another 850 pages of questions about crypto, for sure. Let\u2019s do it. Why should anybody sell a bitcoin? My general philosophy for myself is I\u2019ve only ever had regrets selling investments, pretty much. I think I tell people all the time when I was in college, I bought Nvidia stock. And I thought Nvidia was a great company. They made amazing GPUs for playing computer games. Doom 3 at the time was my favorite computer game, and so I bought it for that reason. And I think I got it at 20 and sold it at 30. And I felt really, really good about myself. I think everyone has those stories of something like that where they exited a little bit early. I think people should sell. My own philosophy, I\u2019ll sell if I have to. But generally speaking, I\u2019m more of an accumulator. I like to accumulate things and hold onto them for a very, very long time. But people have different needs. Sometimes you need to buy something; you have an expense, and you don\u2019t have that luxury. In that case, the fact that these markets are liquid and you can sell and get a good price is very, very important. And imagine you\u2019re someone who bought Bitcoin in 2011 when you got it at, what was it, $1 or $2 a coin? I think it\u2019s not unreasonable for someone like that to sell at some point along the way. I asked that question because my thesis is people only care about Bitcoin because of dollars. It\u2019s the value of Bitcoin as expressed in dollars that makes everybody care about it. And if there\u2019s no reason to get rid of one unless you need the money in dollars, then you will never transact in Bitcoin. It will never stabilize to the point where buying an Nvidia GPU in Bitcoin is a better idea than buying it in dollars. And if you can\u2019t get there, then we really do just have a store of value. We just have another thing. We have digital gold. And you run the platform, and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s your view as well. Yeah, I think the properties of Bitcoin right now are much more conducive to it being a store of value than an actual mechanism for transacting and buying things. I think the fees are really high. And it\u2019s very, very easy, including using platforms like Robinhood to take your crypto or any other asset and convert them back to dollars for when you need to transact. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unique to Bitcoin. I think stocks can essentially be thought of as a store of value from the retail investor standpoint. Nobody\u2019s sending little bits of stock between each other to pay for things. But when you buy a stock, you have a thing. You own some insignificant part of a company. You have voting rights. You could fire the CEO, maybe. There\u2019s a tangible value to owning the stock besides the stock itself. Yeah, yeah, I do, yeah. But what I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t think that it not being used for payments really puts a ceiling on its value. I think that actually it being a medium, I think the medium of exchange use case is becoming less and less important over time. Pretty much anything can be a medium of exchange. Imagine if everyone had Robinhood accounts. Basically if you wanted to pay someone, you\u2019d only need to convert it to dollars at the moment of paying them, and then the recipient can convert it into an asset that appreciates more. And you would obviously have probably a small portion of your portfolio in actual dollars. I think medium of exchange was more important when fungibility was much more difficult like it was back in the day. But now fungibility has never been easier, and so the store value use case probably dominates. It\u2019s weird that I have one vision of the economy that\u2019s like everything\u2019s a casino and another one where everything is Disney bucks, and I don\u2019t know how to reconcile those two things. Well, Disney owns ESPN, so there you go. We\u2019re all going to be gambling on Disney bucks, it\u2019s going to be great, on ESPN Bet. In order to keep the value of Bitcoin or any of these store value coins high, you need a constant buyer. Do you think that the Trump crypto reserve is a good idea? Because that\u2019s the purpose it seems to be serving. Well, I\u2019m not sure. We get the question ourselves about should Robinhood as an entity should have some of its balance sheet in Bitcoin. Every other company is doing that. Why aren\u2019t we doing it? And again, I come back to we only follow the crowd when they\u2019re right. We obviously haven\u2019t jumped into crypto on the balance sheet yet, and I think part of the reason why is that it\u2019s not critical to our purpose as an organization. Of course, if we incidentally had some crypto as part of serving our customers with various activities, we can and do do that, but we also don\u2019t want to become some vehicle for people that just want exposure to Bitcoin to buy our company. I think generally speaking, with the U.S. government, I think you can make the argument that the U.S. spends money on a lot of things that are worse than Bitcoin, and I think that\u2019s true. There\u2019s just blatant waste out there in things like that. Boy, do I disagree with you on that. Also, buying Bitcoin is not a service, right? Yeah. The government mostly spends on services for the citizens. Do you think the Reserve as announced is the right mix of holdings? I\u2019ve heard it called a \u201cShitcoin Reserve\u201d because it has Solana in it. You trade on all these coins, the platform enables all these coins. Is it the right mix of holdings in the Trump Reserve? I think that generally what they announced was not selling the coins that they seize through various mechanisms. I think that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s probably the most I would\u2019ve done if this decision was up to me. And I think there\u2019s reasonable arguments to be made for that. Selling something is also a conscious, affirmative decision. You\u2019re moving a market; you\u2019re doing something by selling it. And again, my personal philosophy, I\u2019ve only had regrets when I\u2019ve sold stuff. I actually think what they outlined was reasonable. Now, it depends on the details of what budget-neutral acquisition of Bitcoin could be. I think that\u2019s a fairly high bar for it to be budget-neutral. I think we\u2019ll see. But yeah, probably I think it\u2019s reasonable. It\u2019s a sensible approach. If it was my decision, I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve gone further. Probably not. Part of your new banking service is that you can get physical cash delivered on demand to your doorstop, because you don\u2019t have locations obviously. How on earth does that work? Are you mailing cash to people? No. We are using on-demand delivery logistics. We haven\u2019t announced our partnerships yet, but we\u2019re not actually doing everything ourselves. Yeah, it\u2019s basically combining the power of on-demand delivery logistics with financial services to bring the retail bank to you. If you look at digital banking before Robinhood, there was always a sacrifice. You had a nice convenience of the digital app, but there were no branches. And so, if you wanted to get cash or even deposit cash, but most likely withdraw, you\u2019d have to go to a 7-Eleven or a CVS or something. And nothing against going to 7-Eleven. I love 7-Eleven, but it\u2019s not quite the private banking experience. In fact, with my private banking experience, I was a FRB client, First Republic Bank, and they had this amazing feature where they would deliver cash to you. It is a high net worth feature, but of course it would be slow, it would be super expensive, it would be for a lot of cash and it would come in an armored vehicle. We asked ourselves, \u201cHow can we make that experience for everyone?\u201d And this is what we came up with. I think we\u2019re excited to roll it out. Wait, are you going to roll up an armored truck to people\u2019s houses? Well, probably not for a small amount, but if you think about it people already get iPhones delivered, and an iPhone is an expensive item \u2014 $1,000, give or take. It\u2019s a small, expensive item, and a high-ticket charge. My estimate is the average ticket charge for a cash delivery order offered by Robinhood is probably going to be in the low hundreds of dollars. Similar dollar value to a delivery order. Maybe a little bit higher, but probably not quite as high as delivering Apple products. I think if you wanted to get a quarter million dollars delivered, you would need an armored truck, and we\u2019d like to facilitate that as well. But for your typical ATM-like transaction, the idea is that that would be a smaller amount, it would get delivered to your house. And we\u2019d like to figure out how to do it outside of your house too, if you\u2019re out at a place that\u2019s in a service area. But that\u2019s a little bit more complicated. But yeah, if it could come to you in 10 or 15 minutes and at low cost, I think there\u2019s real value there. Sixteen percent of payments in the US are still cash payments. Even though we\u2019d all like cash to go away, cash is still very much a giant part of the economy here. Well, I think you can tell I could talk to you for hours and hours about a wide variety of things. We\u2019re going to have to have you back just to talk about the logistics of locating cash around farmers markets throughout the country, because that\u2019s very exciting for me.

Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 10:00am EDT Share Save Comment Alternatives to tariffs in the tech sector could mean taxing the outsourcing of talent. getty When the Trump administration announced the tariffs recently, it was clear that the tech industry would be impacted by what is really a tax on tech goods. PCs, smartphones, and chips from China would have a 154% tariff. And tech products from Taiwan, S. Korea, and Vietnam had a 25% tariff. Late last week, we got some clarification that is good news for many tech companies as PCs, smartphones, and some semiconductors coming out of China and other countries are exempted from this high tax burden. However, U.S. Commerce Secretary Lutnick states these electronic product tariff exemptions are temporary. According to Paul Krugman, if a U.S. company used a Chinese battery, it would still incur a 145% tariff. And if a Chinese battery was in a Chinese laptop the tariff would be 20%. Given that this tariff exemption is temporary, and there is still much uncertainty about the impact of tariffs on all industries, I began wondering if there might be a less painful way to achieve a similar goal, at least within the tech sector and other industries who outsource their work outside of the U.S. In college, I took an elective course on creative thinking. It was offered by either the philosophy department or the psychology department. I needed the credits and took this class more on a whim and less for any impact on my degree field of international marketing. The class focused on alternative and unconventional ways to solve problems.

In light of the recent developments that have introduced substantial tariffs affecting various sectors, notably the tech industry, which exceeds $1 trillion and is within my area of focus, I have started to explore innovative or alternative approaches to implementing tariffs that would minimize adverse effects, especially on the technology sector. In order to help me think through alternative ways to apply more reasonable tariffs on tech, I reached out to some of my trusted tech friends for their ideas and suggestions on this question. One idea suggested is both creative and potentially highly effective. There are six million outsourced software developers and engineers in India alone. Millions more are outsourced in Asia, Mexico, and South America. They work for Tesla, Meta, Google, Nvidia, etc. All this work is moving from the U.S. to India and other countries. There are no penalties, taxes, or tariffs for this outsourcing. If you follow the news about China's education system, you know that they emphasize math and science. I was in a meeting with a tech company in Beijing in 2015, where 8 out of the 10 people at the meeting had a PhD in math and science. India places a similar emphasis on math and science in its educational system. Tech developers and engineers in China and India are becoming increasingly proficient. However, a concerning issue is that the demand for skilled developers in the U.S. remains high. Still, the availability of qualified U.S. workers is limited. Many companies with sufficient resources are outsourcing without facing any repercussions. Imposing tariffs on barbecues manufactured in China is illogical. Instead, tariffs should be applied to software outsourcing, with the proceeds directed toward funding computer science and technology programs in schools. Moving a factory from China to the U.S. will take five years and probably never happen. Taxing software outsourcing can happen in one hour and raise a lot of money for schools and kids. That way, in one or two generations, we will have more computer scientists and technologists in the U.S. with extraordinary tech brainpower to drive even greater innovation from within the U.S. If managed correctly, it would help build America's technical skills base to allow U.S. companies to become more powerful by integrating technology more wisely and effectively. I found the idea of taxing outsourcing and applying those taxes to computer science technology and technologists fascinating. Creating a U.S. workforce that is fundamentally tech-savvy and prepared for a future where technology is at the center of all businesses and not just a benefit but an imperative. It appears there is no such creative thinking of this kind going on in Washington D.C, which is stuck on old-fashioned tariffs to achieve a long-term goal. However, if the U.S. plans to be a leader in the future where tech is driving innovation, jobs, and economic growth that impacts all, putting a tariff or tax on outsourcing and applying a large portion of those funds to drive more math and science into our education system, it could be a win/win for America's future.

I once argued that \u2018 Tesla Cybertruck is a mistake turned marketing tool \u2018, but that was more than a year ago \u2013 before we knew it was a total commercial flop with sales reaching about one-fifth of the production capacity. The argument is that Tesla\u2019s focus on the vehicle is creating this gap in the company\u2019s growth. Still, Tesla is using it as a marketing tool, bringing the Cybertruck to stores in countries where it\u2019s not even selling the vehicle. Tesla is basically using the Cybertruck to bring eyes and try to sell its other vehicles. Advertisement - scroll for more content Now, it\u2019s doing that quite directly by having the Cybertruck carry mobile billboards of its vehicles around. People have been spotting a Cybertruck carrying a mobile advertisement for the new Model Y, which consists of an actual Model Y in a glass trailer. Here\u2019s the ad spotted in Temple, Texas: Tesla Model Y on Display in Glass Cage | Spotted in Temple, TX by u/OshinOfficial in TeslaLounge We previously saw this contraception over a year ago, but it looked like Tesla had given up on the project as it was not spotted again until this weekend. Tesla appears to have used this mobile billboard as part of an owner-organized Cybertruck convoy, which is not a bad idea when you have about 2,400 Cybertrucks in inventory . Put them to work. Lately, we noted that Tesla appears to be ramping up its marketing efforts, including with some \u2018edgy\u2019 social media postings . The increased marketing effort comes amid Tesla being in a brand crisis brought to the company by its CEO\u2019s political meddling, which has angered a significant part of its market. Electrek\u2019s Take Top comment by George W Liked by 9 people You have a few thousand sitting out there waiting to be sold. Find some use for them to depreciate some of your investment. I get emails every couple days to upgrade my 6 year old M3. Price cuts, lower finance. 2 years ago rarely saw these. View all comments Tesla does appear to be ramping up its marketing efforts in the last few weeks in response to lower sales this year. Interestingly, it doesn\u2019t look like the automaker is returning to more traditional advertising, which it only started to do in 2023 and then briefly in 2024. That said, it doesn\u2019t look like Tesla is panicking just yet \u2013 even with the brand new Model Y already available for same-day deliveries in many parts of the US. Tesla investors should start worrying if Tesla starts offering 0% financing on the new Model Y this month in the US, which is already the case in China and wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it comes to America in the coming weeks.

It\u2019s genuinely terrifying, but I also don\u2019t feel like looking at any of these people with terror. They might kill us all (it\u2019s very likely), but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to cower in fear. Mostly because these are some of the biggest f\u2013king losers on the planet. All of that money, all of that access, and Musk is just breaking the government because he hopes that people on the internet will laugh at his pathetic jokes. People within the Trump administration know Musk is a loser too, and they hate his ugly guts. From RS: Throughout the chaos and confusion of Trump\u2019s return to power, Musk also strove to cultivate the image he\u2019s long maintained as a workhorse, showman, and expert in varied fields. He reportedly told friends he was sleeping at DOGE offices, rehashing claims he previously made about sleeping on a Tesla factory floor. He\u2019s continually posted grandiose and often inaccurate estimates of how much money DOGE has saved. And he seemed to relish his role as an all-powerful agitator. Musk began regularly smearing his enemies as \u201cr\u2013ards\u201d on X and targeting judges who ruled against the administration or blocked DOGE\u2019s incursions. He grew bold enough to describe Social Security, long considered untouchable, as \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d At the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk waved around a chain saw he said would slice through \u201cbureaucracy\u201d \u2014 this on the same day that his former partner Grimes publicly begged him on X to respond to her about a medical crisis experienced by one of their three children. \u201cI am become meme,\u201d he said onstage. \u201cI\u2019m living the meme. You know, it\u2019s like, there\u2019s living the dream, and there\u2019s living the meme, and that\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s happening.\u201d The bizarre CPAC appearance prompted speculation about Musk\u2019s state of mind and recreational drug use, as he was wearing sunglasses inside and had difficulty stringing sentences together. People close to Musk have told The Wall Street Journal they have known him to use illegal drugs, including LSD, cocaine, Ecstasy, and mushrooms \u2014 a source of concern for some of the board members over\u00adseeing his companies. (Musk has denied using illegal drugs, though he has spoken about his use of prescription ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic.) Some senior Trump ad\u00administration officials and Cabinet members have found themselves deeply annoyed by Musk. Sec\u00adretary of State Marco Rubio, three people fa\u00admiliar with the matter say, hasn\u2019t hidden his \u00addisdain for Musk, with some State Department officials nicknaming the Tesla billionaire \u201cCrazy Uncle Elon,\u201d two of those sources tell Rolling Stone. \u201cI have been in the same room with Elon, and he always tries to be funny. And he\u2019s not funny. Like, at all,\u201d says a senior Trump administration official. \u201cHe makes these jokes and little asides and smiles and then looks almost hurt if you don\u2019t lap up his humor. I keep using the word \u2018annoying\u2019; a lot of people who have to deal with him do. But the word doesn\u2019t do the situation justice. Elon just thinks he\u2019s smarter than everyone else in the room and acts like it, even when it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d Musk has gnawed at the patience of an array of high-\u00adranking administration officials, to the point that \u2014 according to this official and two others \u2014 Trump lieutenants have walked out of meetings and earnestly asked one another if they thought Musk was high. Administration officials joked to one another about subjecting Musk to mandatory drug testing, which Musk himself has said would be a \u201cgreat idea\u201d for federal employees. (A lawyer for Musk has said he\u2019s \u201cregularly and randomly drug-tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test.\u201d) \u201cTalking to the guy is sometimes like listening to really rusty nails on a chalkboard,\u201d says the senior Trump administration official, who adds that Musk is not much of a team player, either. \u201cHe\u2019s just the most irritating person I\u2019ve ever had to deal with, and that is saying something.\u201d [From Rolling Stone] Earlier this month, Trump began telling people that Musk would be \u201cstepping back soon.\u201d But\u2026 Musk was in Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting last week, and Musk apparently addressed the Cabinet, sitting across from Trump. My vibe is that Musk is clinging to \u201cpower\u201d and Trump is trying to break it off gently. But who knows \u2013 I\u2019ve actually been surprised by Trump\u2019s tolerance for Musk in the past six months, because Musk truly is that profoundly gross and uncool. It also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Musk was just constantly getting high and Trump had no idea. Photos courtesy of Backgrid, Cover Images.

Reply It Really Is You, Not Me says: April 14, 2025 at 10:18 am I am currently halfway through Walter Isaacson\u2018s biography on musk, and I never fully appreciated before how much his work for DOGE is applying the principles he has applied to disrupting car manufacturing and space exploration in the business world to the government. He believes in challenging requirements and the way things have always been done. He believes in cutting and destroying first and then adding back where needed. there\u2019s a quote from Musk that once he cuts, if he doesn\u2019t add back in at least 10% of what he\u2019s cut that means The cuts weren\u2019t deep enough to begin with. The problem is, the government doesn\u2019t work the same way that tech businesses do and the stakes are much higher. People really get hurt when these cuts are not carefully planned and implemented. I think musk has finally met his Waterloo. He\u2019s not going to have the same power when the Repubs get done with him.

Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday with some clarifications. \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote, adding: \"Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\" Trump denied there were ever actually exemptions from tariffs because a previous tariff is still in place. \"There was no Tariff 'exception',\" Trump wrote. \"These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Trump's comments during an interview with ABC News on Sunday, saying that tech products would be subject to tariffs after an investigation into the effect importing vital tech components has on national security So, not quite an exemption \u2014 but exempt-ish. It was still welcome news for Big Tech. As chaotic as the messaging over the weekend was, certain tech products are no longer exposed to the 145% reciprocal tariff on China.

TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . The big picture: China has halted exports of critical rare earth metals and magnets essential to industries ranging from automotive manufacturing to aerospace and defense. The move, which has sent shockwaves through global supply chains, began earlier this month when China placed new export restrictions on these minerals. The suspension comes as Beijing drafts a new regulatory framework for issuing export licenses, a process expected to restrict access to these vital materials for specific companies, particularly American military contractors. Industry leaders fear the delay in establishing the licensing system could lead to shortages of rare earth components outside of China. Michael Silver, CEO of American Elements, told the New York Times that his company had been informed it would take at least 45 days before exports might resume. \"We anticipated this trade war and increased our inventory last winter,\" Silver said, adding that his firm could meet existing contracts in the interim. Rare earth metals are indispensable for modern technology. They are used in electric motors for vehicles, drones, robots, and missiles, as well as in jet engines, lasers, and computer chips powering artificial intelligence servers and smartphones. Among these metals, heavy rare earths are particularly crucial for producing magnets capable of maintaining their properties under high temperatures or electrical fields. Daniel Pickard, chairman of the critical minerals advisory committee for the US Trade Representative and Department of Commerce, warned of severe impacts on American industries if the export restrictions persist. \"A sustained disruption could hurt China's reputation as a reliable supplier,\" Pickard said. China's monopoly on rare earths is well-documented. Until 2023, it produced 99 percent of the world's heavy rare earth metals and continues to manufacture 90 percent of rare earth magnets globally. The remaining production comes from Japan and Germany, both reliant on Chinese raw materials. // Related Stories Whistleblower tells Congress Facebook worked with China on censorship and data access New restrictions on China's rare earths will likely disrupt tech and defense industries The Mountain Pass mine in California, owned by MP Materials, is the sole US-based source of rare earths but cannot meet domestic demand. James Litinsky, MP Materials' CEO, expressed concern over the implications for military contractors. \"Drones and robotics are widely considered the future of warfare,\" Litinsky said. \"Based on everything we are seeing, the critical inputs for our future supply chain are shut down.\" The export restrictions have not been uniformly enforced across Chinese ports. Some customs officials permit shipments containing minimal traces of heavy rare earth metals if they are destined for non-US markets. Others demand rigorous testing to ensure compliance with the new rules before allowing the exports to proceed. Meanwhile, Chinese officials have barred domestic companies from engaging with an expanding list of American firms, further complicating international trade. China's dominance in rare earth production is rooted in its rich deposits near Longnan in Jiangxi Province. The region hosts mines that extract heavy rare earths through chemical-intensive processes known to cause severe pollution \u2013 a practice temporarily halted but seemingly resumed recently. Refineries near Longnan process these ores before sending them to magnet factories in Ganzhou, including JL Mag Rare-Earth Company, which supplies leading electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla and BYD. The geopolitical implications of this development are significant. Xi Jinping's visit to JL Mag's factory in 2019 was widely interpreted as a signal that China could leverage its control over rare earths during trade disputes \u2013 a tactic it is now employing against the backdrop of heightened tensions with Washington following President Trump's tariff hikes earlier this month. 48 comments 288 likes and shares Share this article: Featured on TechSpot Sony stops making 8K TVs, but UHD cameras remain key Trump's tariffs could prove to be a \"nuclear bomb\" on international trade and tech imports, experts warn Most Popular Atari 2600: The Atlantis of Game Consoles 22 comments Trump's tariffs force laptop makers like Dell and Lenovo to halt US shipments 44 comments Sony stops making 8K TVs, but ultra high-def cameras remain key to future 10 comments Biotech firm creates weight loss pill that mimics the effects of gastric bypass surgery 51 comments Ubisoft argues players don't own their games in wake of The Crew lawsuit Load Comments 48 ...

Written after the death of his wife of 43 years, it\u2019s about the unending nature of grief, the strange ways that people suffer, and what constitutes the truth in a world of endless, meaningless possibilities. In \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d (in theaters April 18), an entrepreneur named Karsh ( Vincent Cassel ) has designed a high-tech burial shroud, equipped with cameras, that allows the bereaved to watch the bodies of their loved ones decomposing in real time. Karsh was moved to create this technology, which he calls GraveTech, by the loss of his wife, Becca ( Diane Kruger ), after a debilitating illness. That he can\u2019t bring himself to move on is a frequent topic of conversation with Becca\u2019s twin sister, Terry (also Kruger), with Terry\u2019s ex-husband, Maury ( Guy Pearce ), and with the AI assistant (voiced by Kruger) upon which he\u2019s become increasingly dependent. After one of the cemeteries is vandalized, with Becca\u2019s grave among those desecrated, Karsh attempts to investigate, though tracking down those responsible\u2014with Icelandic eco-terrorists, Chinese corporations, and nefarious doctors in the mix, there\u2019s no shortage of suspects\u2014turns out to be more difficult than expected. At the same time, he\u2019s trying to date again, embarking on a relationship with a blind woman (Sandrine Holt) whose terminally ill husband stands to invest in GraveTech. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a career out of bodies,\u201d a character tells Karsh at one point, and it\u2019s separately fascinating to read \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d as Cronenberg reflecting on his career-long interest in both matters of the flesh and his characters\u2019 amorphous insides. With a shock of white hair and a European accent that\u2019s amusingly askew in the film\u2019s Toronto setting (shot in mournfully mundane shades of gray by cinematographer Douglas Koch, who also lensed \u201c Crimes of the Future \u201d), Cassel makes for a particularly intriguing director stand-in. Even as it explores burial rites and mourning phases, there\u2019s a metastatic quality to \u201cThe Shrouds,\u201d in that it starts out as a meditation on grief but gradually spreads from there into a more unsettling, peculiar, and morbidly funny vision of dystopia. From his central concept of burial shrouds that perhaps misleadingly intimate the same closeness their digital connectivity only allows from a distance, Cronenberg extrapolates a near-future in which his characters\u2019 confusion and paranoia is sustained and often justified by artificially simulated images and the multitude of untrustworthy screens they\u2019re presented through. At last fall\u2019s New York Film Festival, where \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d screened as a Main Slate selection, Cronenberg spoke with RogerEbert.com about why art is not therapy, how the body is reality, and what conspiratorial thinking has to offer for those in search of comfort and closure. This interview has been edited and condensed. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today. I saw \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d for the first time at Cannes, and I had an opportunity to do so again at the NYFF screening. I mention that because, with this audience more than the Cannes audience, people were laughing throughout. This is a moving film, but it\u2019s also a very funny one. Thank you. As you know, in Cannes, there weren\u2019t so many laughs. There were probably more laughs here than in Cannes, because of the language barrier. I think people are afraid to laugh at Cannes sometimes, as well. It\u2019s so powerful; the venue has this glitz and glamor. They laughed more at the Toronto International Film Festival, for example, and I\u2019m sure they did here as well. They get the jokes better. \u201cCrimes of the Future\u201d ends with this extraordinary shot, impossibly close to Viggo Mortensen\u2019s face, that evokes \u201cThe Passion of Joan of Arc,\u201d by Carl Theodor Dreyer: gaze cast upward, eyes far away, a single tear rolling down his cheek. One of the first shots in \u201cThe Shrouds,\u201d of Vincent Cassel in the grave with his wife\u2019s corpse, bearing witness to her body\u2019s deterioration, reminded me just as directly of the out-of-body experience of the coffin viewing in \u201cVampyr,\u201d the film Dreyer made next. I can see why you connect those moments. I can\u2019t say it was inspired by \u201cVampyr,\u201d or anything like that, in this case, but that moment was the first one I wrote. What inspired me was this sense of the Jewish philosophy of the soul and the body. I can\u2019t tell you what else inspired me, other than that it came to me that he would be dreaming, and he would be seeing that, and that he would be under a dentist\u2019s anesthetic. I don\u2019t know where it came from beyond that; I can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s a powerful moment: this intimate but still essentially abstract access that Karsh has gained, through the shrouds, brings him no catharsis. It only prolongs pain. It\u2019s the same for me and my film. I wouldn\u2019t say that it prolongs the pain; it just acknowledges it. To me, art is not therapy, and there\u2019s no catharsis. It\u2019s not cathartic to do something like this film, for me. I can tell you an anecdote: an Italian psychiatrist came to my house in Toronto to talk to me because he liked to write about films from the psychiatric point of view. And one of the things he said was, \u201cHow are you dealing with your loss?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m suffering. That\u2019s how I\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d And he said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think you need any therapy.\u201d [ laughs ] Because that\u2019s the reality: you will suffer, and it won\u2019t go away. Doing the movie was more because, as an artist, you tend to shape your experience of life into some kind of art, and that\u2019s your impulse to do that. But, as I say, it\u2019s not for catharsis, and it\u2019s not for therapy. I mean, listen, if there\u2019s some sculptor or painter who said, \u201cNo, what I do is therapy,\u201d fine. I\u2019m not going to argue. But for me, I don\u2019t see art as being that; it\u2019s something else. I\u2019m the same as Karsh. You\u2019re looking at it, but that doesn\u2019t make it less painful. You come from a secular Jewish background, but Karsh does not. In that first scene, with his date, Karsh refers to himself as a \u201cnon-observant atheist\u201d and even suggests that the shroud of Turin might be a fake. \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d is a film most concerned with burial rites and customs, so I\u2019m curious about positioning Karsh outside of a chosen faith despite the nature of his work. It was interesting for me to open with that. As he discusses with his date, it\u2019s all from the point of view of someone who would be religious: not him but, he\u2019s saying, in the Jewish religion, this is what matters. I normally don\u2019t have characters who are driven by religion; it doesn\u2019t really interest me, in general, but in terms of the emotion and situation of the film, it felt right to do that in this film. This was a pretty Jewish film, on many levels. Down to the Matzoh ball soup and pastrami. Yes, with corned-beef sandwiches, even. There\u2019s an absurdity to mourning rituals, as well, in that a certain distance can open up for the observant. This series of cultural and religious expectations can sometimes supplant a more direct, personal, emotional reckoning with grief\u2014as if it\u2019s a screen they\u2019re looking through, which you get at in this film. But they go together, you know? A lot of the ritual around grief has been developed in order to shape the grief and bring to it a communal understanding, so there\u2019s not just a private grief. Through ritual, you share the grief. And I understand that, from a human point of view. In terms of actually believing in a soul after life? Well, I don\u2019t. But I understand the metaphorical use of that idea. And it\u2019s not just metaphorical; there\u2019s an emotional and a communal understanding that goes with it. For Karsh, given the commercial potential he seems to see in GraveTech, I found it intriguing to see his grief being shaped by capitalism, outside of other cultures or religions. Being a capitalist and an entrepreneur is his art. It\u2019s his mode of expression, his way of dealing with the world and engaging with it. For him, it\u2019s a natural thing to do something like GraveTech. It\u2019s not perverse. It\u2019s not dishonorable. It might make money or might not; we don\u2019t get into that. As Maury, his brother-in-law, says, \u201cI\u2019m going to bring down the whole empire.\u201d And Terry says, \u201cThere is no empire!\u201d He wants one, maybe, but he hasn\u2019t created it yet. And it\u2019s his version of making the movie. For me, it\u2019s making the movie; for him, it\u2019s making the GraveTech cemetery. One could say, \u201cyou making this movie is you making money from your grief.\u201d If you want to get moralistic about it\u2014although I think it would be rather strange\u2014you could say this film is exploitative, that you\u2019re exploiting the death of your wife. But if you do that, then you have dismantled the whole human enterprise of art. You\u2019ve made art impossible, basically. You\u2019re saying all art is immoral, because it\u2019s always exploitative. And I can see some people being happy to do that\u2014not to get into it, but if you agree with the whole idea in identity politics that you can only create characters who are like you, then there\u2019s no art. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s over. The shrouds allow people to watch their loved ones decompose\u2014in 8K resolution, even, with the most recent upgrades. This is a film full of screens \u2026 There are a lot of screens, yes, including in the Tesla. And the reality of what anybody\u2019s being shown\u2014versus what they\u2019re seeing\u2014through screens is in question; the screen is not necessarily bringing you closer to anything other than its own display. Because it\u2019s a creation. There\u2019s a lot of technology and a lot of creativity on every screen\u2014on those screens, on your phone\u2019s home screen. That leaves a lot of room for other kinds of things to be there between you and what you want to see. A lot of it is great and exciting, and some of it is sinister. Karsh is alerted, at one point, that Hunny\u2014his animated AI assistant, who resembles both Becca and her sister\u2014is not trustworthy, because she\u2019s not independent and is instead being controlled by somebody hiding behind the image. What you\u2019re saying is that there\u2019s this ideal of a completely independent AI creature responding to you in a completely independent way, like another human might, and that\u2019s said to be a good thing. That\u2019s the goal. But is it really the goal? And is it really possible? The film\u2019s about all these things. Many of your films have explored the relationship between the body and the spirit. In following the body after death\u2014through disease and decay\u2014how did you think about the relative presence or absence of the soul in this particular film? It\u2019s very straightforward, and it\u2019s very existentialist. You\u2019re basically saying that body is reality, taken from \u201cCrimes of the Future.\u201d Body is human reality. It\u2019s the way we understand the Earth, as being all about our neurology and neurological structure. And when the body ends, you end, and that\u2019s it. You\u2019re back to oblivion, where you came from; therefore, there is no afterlife, and there is no point in killing people because of your views of Heaven or some afterlife, though people still do that. That\u2019s basically it. Karsh is accepting that reality. He\u2019s not going with the dream that you see him in, at first, that there\u2019s a soul fluttering around, and it\u2019s separate from the body. That\u2019s him thinking about the way some people that he knows might think about it, but in his reality, there is nothing, and that\u2019s a fantasy or a delusion, depending on how you look at it. That\u2019s my feeling as an atheist. I\u2019m not a militant atheist, although, honestly, I think the world would be better off if everybody was an atheist\u2014but maybe I\u2019m wrong about that. It certainly didn\u2019t work very well for the Soviet Union, so whatever. There have been, and still are, some experiments in atheism, and it always ends up being that the state then becomes the religion, and then the martyrs of the state end up being the saints, so you\u2019re really constructing another religion\u2014as in North Korea, for example, or the religion of high tech, where we also have our martyrs. If the body is reality, can there be anything real in disembodied, digital spaces? There\u2019s a swirl of confusion created by the online interactions in this film, and \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d is at its funniest in turning this search for truth and meaning into a full-on conspiracy. That search is itself a conspiracy, I\u2019m saying. Even if it\u2019s a political conspiracy, it\u2019s empowering you, because you know what\u2019s really going on, so you\u2019re very special. But it\u2019s also giving meaning to some things that are meaningless. And so, in a sense, death is meaningless, and the death of someone young is especially meaningless. Could it really just be the rampages of a single cell that becomes tumors, that becomes cancerous? Is that really what it\u2019s all about? That seems meaningless. It doesn\u2019t make sense. This entire human being who\u2019s had an entire, complex life is suddenly dead because of that one thing? That can\u2019t be possible. It must be something else. It must be the doctors. It must be the priest. Maybe she was taking some drugs that I didn\u2019t know about. Maybe she was having an affair with some crazy person. It\u2019s all to find a way to deal with the grief, and that\u2019s just one possibility. One conspiracy theory I\u2019m fond of is dead-internet theory: that bots and algorithms generate most internet content, and organic human interaction is disappearing online. That it\u2019s all bots talking to bots? Yes: that\u2019s possible. I think humans will still want to interact with other humans, and they\u2019ll find ways to make sure that they\u2019re really doing that, but it\u2019s absolutely the case right now, with deepfakes everywhere. It\u2019s compelling and full of all kinds of possibilities, most of them sort of stupid but some of them quite sinister. With every form of communication, there have always been people trying to control us through it, with propaganda. What is propaganda? Well, it\u2019s bot stuff, really\u2014a relatively, technologically primitive version of bots. If you look at the history of propaganda, it\u2019s been around forever, and it\u2019s usually sophisticated for whatever time it comes from. Right now, there are more people on Earth, and there\u2019s more ways to reach them than ever before, so it\u2019s kind of working together. I\u2019d asked about Dreyer earlier, but I was curious as well to ask about Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s place among your influences, given what I saw reflected of \u201cVertigo\u201d in Karsh\u2019s relationship with Becca\u2019s twin sister, really with all three of Diane Kruger\u2019s characters. I mean, I love Hitchcock, and I enjoy his presence as a character as well as a filmmaker. And he made many wonderful films, and he was a really entertaining guy. And I think the way he talked about filmmaking, he was being a little bit naughty in what he was saying, because I think that it was a lot more art, spontaneity, and personality at play, in that he wasn\u2019t just the puppet master manipulating the audience, which is the way he liked to play it. I think there was a lot of himself in that. For me, it\u2019s not like De Palma, who really specifically worshipped him and modeled himself around his structures. I don\u2019t say this as a matter of humble bragging, but I really took my creative inspiration from literature more than movies, even though I loved movies and saw everything, from cowboy movies to you name it, being a kid. I don\u2019t really have a specific guiding spirit when it comes to movies as such. Obviously, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve taken tons of stuff from everybody. I don\u2019t normally think of myself as taking anything from Hitchcock, but there\u2019s a moment in \u201cVertigo\u201d where I remember thinking, \u201cThis makes no psychological sense, whatsoever.\u201d James Stewart is dressing Kim Novak as his wife, and he says, \u201cSurely, it can\u2019t matter to you.\u201d [ laughs ] And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any woman who it wouldn\u2019t matter to,\u201d you know? You\u2019re dressing me up to look like your dead wife. I mean, really. I thought that was a bit of structural manipulation but not very realistic; even as a kid, when I saw the movie, I didn\u2019t buy that. I thought, \u201cShe\u2019s gotta say no!\u201d [ laughs ] This reminds me of the catastrophic date Karsh takes this woman on, to the restaurant that adjoins the cemetery where his wife is buried. There\u2019s this projection of his complex of grief over all the other characters on screen. It feels like we\u2019re inside his headspace, looking out. Although I do like Maury, because Maury has some things going on. And, honestly, if you asked Diane Kruger, she would say it\u2019s Terry, because she had a lot of fun playing with Terry, who was sort of outrageous. But it is a Karsh-focused story; it is, in that sense, a first-person movie. But I don\u2019t think about that, honestly. I let the characters wrestle with each other as they can. I\u2019ve had a couple of movies with women as protagonists, like \u201ceXistenZ,\u201d for example, and that just seemed like a natural choice for that movie. I distinctly remember not being able to get it to work until I changed the protagonist to a woman. Why that was the case, I have no idea, but I went with it, so it became her first-person story. Once it starts to come alive, I don\u2019t worry about what it is, in that sense, or what its structure is. It tells you when it\u2019s coming alive, and when it\u2019s fighting you and it\u2019s not coming alive. Is it always easy to see which direction an idea\u2019s going in? Once the momentum is there, I don\u2019t recall really wrestling in that way, where it\u2019s fighting me to the death. You get past a certain point, and it just starts to flow. You go back and forth. It\u2019s never completely linear. But I haven\u2019t had that problem. How did you end up with Vincent Cassel in the lead role, and what do you make of those who\u2019ve said that he looks like you\u2014or that he was styled to resemble you? As I have jokingly\u2014but honestly\u2014said, I didn\u2019t cast him for his hair. I\u2019ve always said that casting is a black art, and there\u2019s a lot that goes into it\u2014including whose passport is involved, because it\u2019s an international co-production, and that you can\u2019t have everybody you want, for obvious reasons. They might not want to do it, they might be too expensive, and they might not be available. I considered a lot of people before I ended up with Vincent. It wasn\u2019t really, \u201cLet\u2019s find somebody who looks like me,\u201d because I frankly do not think that Vincent looks at all like me, right? Well\u2026 The hair, maybe, a little bit. Unbelievable as it might seem to some people, it never occurred to me that he was looking anything like me, frankly. It creates this inability to fully grip the character, I think, because there\u2019s that slight resonance of resemblance. That\u2019s true. And that\u2019s, first of all, because I wrote it that way, though I\u2019m not an entrepreneur, and I don\u2019t own a restaurant or a cemetery, and I would not be very good at it if I did. But I did say to Vincent\u2014although I knew he would have an accent\u2014to basically use me as a model for speaking, because this is a Toronto movie, and these people are from midtown Toronto. That\u2019s where I\u2019m from, and that\u2019s where my accent comes from. \u201cAs you try to dampen your French accent a little bit and make it a little more Canadian,\u201d I told him, \u201cuse me as a model.\u201d I said the same to Diane, actually, and she was very good at it. And one of the things that he did was slow down his speech, because he\u2019s usually very rapid-fire in French, and his French movies are very quick and staccato. He wanted to be \u201cmore chill,\u201d as he said that\u2019s what he thinks I am. He should only know. He would chill it down and be a little more relaxed in his speech. It wasn\u2019t just the accent, but it\u2019s the rhythm of speech, and I can see why that would make people think even more that he was my surrogate. And that\u2019s okay. The fact that some of the dialogue in the movie has come from my life right to the screen, and that its initiation was because of my wife\u2019s death, doesn\u2019t make it a good movie automatically, just because it\u2019s based on real life. That\u2019s just the beginning. In a way, it\u2019s irrelevant. I know it\u2019s of interest to people who read about it, but for people who have no idea who I am, have never met me, and don\u2019t know what I look like, the movie has to work. The characters have to be alive on their own. They can\u2019t take anything from me into it, so it\u2019s not really an added value. \u201cThe Shrouds\u201d opens in U.S. theaters April 18, via Janus and Sideshow.

The memo also mentioned that Trump stands 75 inches tall and weighs 224 pounds, indicating a notable weight loss since his first term. The report stated Trump's frequent victories in golf as one of the reasons for his active lifestyle. PTI The summary noted that Trump previously had cataract surgery on both eyes, but gave no date or dates President Donald Trump is \"fully fit\" to perform the duties of the presidency, the White House physician said in a memorandum released Sunday. The White House released Trump's annual physical examination results that cited his \u201cfrequent victories\u201d in golf tournaments as evidence of his robust health. The doctor said Trump\u2019s days are filled with meetings, public appearances, media availabilities and \u201cfrequent victories in golf events.\u201d Trump is an avid golfer who said he recently won tournaments played at clubs he owns in Florida. \u2014 PressSec (@PressSec) In the first annual physical of his second presidential term at a Washington DC-area hospital, Trump was also found to have scarring \"on the right ear from a gunshot wound\", after an assassination attempt last July. The note, which included details of laboratory work, physical examinations and a cognitive test, concluded that Trump remains in \u201cexcellent health.\u201d ALSO READ: Blue-Origin rocket launch: Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez ready for space flight with all-female crew Live Events Report shows improvement in Trump's health Trump, who is 78 years old, weighs 224 pounds and is 75 inches tall, the note reports. His resting heart rate is 62 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 128/74 mmHg, which is considered elevated. His weight is down 20 pounds from his final presidential physical in 2020, when he came in at 244 pounds. His cholesterol levels have also improved since he last released details of his physical health. His physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, cited an \u201cactive lifestyle\u201d that \u201dcontinues to contribute significantly\u201d to the Republican president\u2019s well-being. Trump turns 79 on June 14. The summary noted that Trump previously had cataract surgery on both eyes, but gave no date or dates. \"President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,\" his doctor, Captain Sean Barbabella, said in a memo.

Trump was also given the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and scored 30 out of 30, said Dr Barbabella. The test is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia and has tasks such as naming animals, drawing a clock and repeating words back five minutes later. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he \"got every answer right\" on the cognitive test. \"Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,\" Trump said. \"A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.\" He added that doctors had given him \"a little bit\" of advice on lifestyle changes to improve his health, though he did not provide details.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . The US tech elite are down sharply in wealth this year while their Chinese rivals are up strongly. Elon Musk's net worth has tanked by $121 billion, while Bytedance's CEO is up nearly $14 billion. Their contrasting fortunes are one result of the global trade turmoil sparked by President Donald Trump. America's tech titans have lost billions this year while their Chinese rivals have racked up large wealth gains amid President Donald Trump 's tariff-induced trade war. The tariffs have reignited fears of inflation and recession in the US, spurring investors to dump high-flying tech stocks in favor of safer holdings such as gold and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway . The sell-off has hammered the net worths of most of the richest Americans, whose stakes in tech companies make up the vast majority of their wealth. Trump has aimed some of the highest duties at imports from China, putting the world's second-largest economy under more pressure. Nevertheless, Chinese tech stocks have rallied strongly this year at the prospect of friendlier regulation and fresh government stimulus, boosting the fortunes of China's tech elite. As of Friday's close, the 20 biggest gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index have grown their combined wealth by $139 billion this year \u2014 more than BlackRock is worth. Meanwhile, the 20 largest wealth losers have seen $450 billion vaporized , a figure greater than Exxon Mobil's market value. It's striking that nine of the top 20 gainers are Chinese and only four are American, while 15 of the 20 biggest losers are American and none are Chinese. That trend may speak to how their companies' outlooks have changed , at least in the eyes of the global investment community, and how the US and China are expected to fare in the trade war. The Chinese executives racking up wealth this year include Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming , Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, and BYD founder Wang Chuanfu. They've jointly added a combined $26 billion, with Zhang gaining $13.6 billion, or 31%, to $57 billion \u2014 putting him in 24th place on the rich list. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun is worth $37 billion. Luna Lin/AFP/Getty Images The US bosses hit hardest are Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison , and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . They've lost a collective $193 billion, with Musk shedding $121 billion or 28%. The richest Americans have lost far more than the Chinese elite have gained for a few reasons. Their fortunes are larger, so a 10% swing in their net worth is a bigger move in dollar terms. US stocks as a whole are more richly valued than Chinese equities, making them more vulnerable to steeper declines. It's also worth underscoring the greater role of the Chinese government in shoring up its markets and supporting domestic champions, which can help to limit declines in Chinese stocks . Vladimir Popov, a principal researcher at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute in Moscow, told Business Insider that China's more equal income and wealth distribution and more collectivist culture than the US were key to its global competitiveness \u2014 and thus the wealth of its richest executives. The economic development scholar added that China having fewer billionaires than the US, who wield less political influence than their American counterparts, help it to weather trade wars, probably because it's easier to maintain a united front. Trouble for Tesla Chinese billionaires' wealth gains also reflect their companies' strong progress. For example, BYD 's sales of electric and hybrid vehicles surged by 40% to a record $107 billion last year, surpassing Tesla's revenues of $98 billion, as the Chinese EV maker made inroads into foreign markets . Meanwhile, Tesla stock is under pressure not only because of Musk's proximity to Trump and leading role in cutting government spending and workers, but also because of concerns about tariffs and competition. Politics aside, Tesla has \"struggled with an ageing line up, recalls of its much-vaunted Cybertruck and increased competition, especially from Chinese players like BYD,\" said Danni Hewson of AJ Bell in a recent note. If Chinese executives scale the global wealth ladder while American titans slide down the rungs, it could signal a sea change in market sentiment \u2014 and an upheaval of the global economic order .

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter (now X) and original founder of the Bluesky project, believes that the US should \u201cdelete all IP law,\u201d a statement supported by Elon Musk, current owner of X. More people joined the conversation, including dissenting voices. Intellectual property seems to be the eternal topic of debate in the artificial intelligence sector. The nature of AI systems requires collecting as much data as possible from the internet, but content creators (such as publishers and artists) want compensation for this. Now, Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk are advocating for deleting the current IP or copyright law to set more permissive conditions. Copyright and artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence companies operate in a gray area when it comes to copyright. They argue that training AI models falls under the fair use doctrine. This is because, ultimately, these platforms don\u2019t just replicate the original content per se. Fair use allows for copyrighted content if used \u201ctransformatively.\u201d In other words, the output must be something new and not a simple carbon copy of the source material. On the other hand, content creators claim that there is no fair use and that current copyright laws should apply. There is still no clear legislation on the matter, with artists hoping for a resounding victory in court that could serve as a precedent for future lawsuits against AI companies. However, that has not yet happened. \u201c Delete all IP law ,\u201d says Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk supports Amid this situation, the controversial figure of Jack Dorsey emerges . Dorsey was a co-founder of Twitter and started the Bluesky project. However, he left the board of directors of the latter, disliking the direction it was taking. In a recent post on X/Twitter , he stated, \u201c Delete all IP law ,\u201d to which Elon Musk, current owner of X, responded, \u201c I agree .\u201d Some prominent figures in the tech industry have made similar suggestions in the recent past. Until now, the idea has come primarily from the artificial intelligence industry. In March, OpenAI proposed to the US government a deregulation that would allow AI companies to freely use content available on the internet to train their models. Elon Musk has also been vocal in the past about his stance on copyright. He once told Jay Leno that \u201c patents are for the weak .\u201d He also gave the example of one of his companies, Tesla. Musk allowed competitors to freely use his electric car patents \u201c in good faith .\u201d Meanwhile, Dorsey has supported open-source initiatives for decentralized social platforms. More industry figures joined the conversation, such as tech investor Chris Messina, who said that Dorsey \u201c has a point ,\u201d because \u201c Automated IP fines/3-strike rules for AI infringement may become the substitute for putting poor people in jail for cannabis possession .\u201d Returning to Dorsey, he added that there are \u201c much greater models to pay creators \u201d and that \u201c the current ones take way too much from them and only rent-seek .\u201d Some voices against There were also voices against this position. Attorney Nicole Shanahan first responded \u201c NO ,\u201d adding that the \u201c IP law is the only thing separating human creations from AI creations .\u201d To this, Dorsey responded, \u201c creativity is what currently separates us, and the current system is limiting that, and putting the payments disbursement into the hands of gatekeepers who aren\u2019t paying out fairly .\u201d Ed Newton-Rex of the NGO Fairly Trained said, \u201c Tech execs declaring all-out war on creators who don\u2019t want their life\u2019s work pillaged for profit .\u201d Writer Lincoln Michel stated , \u201c none of Jack or Elon\u2019s companies would exist without IP law. \u201d \u201c They just hate artists ,\u201d he added.

Even as Tesla\u2019s fortunes continue to decline , EV sales shot up more than 35% year over year \u2013 now approaching 17% of the market, and that\u2019s WITHOUT government incentives! Spanish media outlet Motorpasi\u00f3n is reporting that Germany\u2019s Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (or KBA; sort of like the American National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, NHTSA) says electric cars already make up 17% of all new vehicle registrations in the European country. And that EV market share is accelerating, despite the cancelation of government EV subsidies in late 2023 . At the same time, Tesla \u2013 whose Model Y electric crossover was, at one point, the best-selling car in the world \u2013 is watching its sales tank globally. That\u2019s especially true in Germany, where the American EV brand saw a 70% drop in sales through the first two months of the year , YOY, and some 94% of survey respondents (allegedly) said they wouldn\u2019t buy a Tesla . All of which begs the question: what gives ? Advertisement - scroll for more content Pull-ahead EV sales + Elon\u2019s Musk New Tesla Model Y; via Tesla. The first part of this two-part answer involves German EV subsidies. The nation\u2019s government issued a \u20ac4,500 subsidy for the purchase of a new EV with a sub-\u20ac40,000 list price (\u20ac3,000 for \u20ac40-65,000 cars). That often-criticized program was always intended to be temporary, however, and after EV sales reached one million units the subsidy was canceled for business customers in September in 2023 and private individuals the end of December . The result of that cancellation was a significant drop in new EV sales in 2024 vs. \u201923 \u2013 but that\u2019s easily explained by \u201cpull-ahead\u201d sales driven by the knowledge that the government subsidy would be ending soon. And, sure, you don\u2019t see the sort of spikes you see in the US when people who don\u2019t understand basic economic concepts or what tariffs are suddenly gain political power, but that has as much to do with the way cars are sold in Europe as anything else. In Europe, car buyers typically visit dealers to look at options and features and work with their salespeople to place an order for a new car. The car is built to their customized specifications, and the customer waits anywhere 3-4 months for delivery. There is no, \u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna take for you to drive one of these home, today?\u201d in other words. That\u2019s part one. The second part is the overwhelming stink of Elon Musk (see what I did there?). The Tesla CEO\u2019s passionate embrace of the alt-right and even far-right political movement combined with not one but two \u201cRoman\u201d salutes at Trump\u2019s inauguration (wink-wink, nudge-nudge) have turned the brand\u2019s electric cars into political statements , whether their owners wanted that or not \u2013 and many are trading out of their Teslas much earlier than they\u2019d originally planned in favor of a vehicle that\u2019s less politically charged. Top comment by fromEurope Liked by 10 people True story here is that BEV seems to compete rather well to ICE without incentives! VW group must be happy : 6 top positions and 7 in top 10.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Korok Ray is a PhD economist/professor who researches/teaches Bitcoin. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 09:00am EDT Share Save Comment Return vs Strike Price for MSTR Put Option Korok Ray MSTR has been on a general downtrend since November 20, 2024. Has it been profitable to short? MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, has been buying bitcoin for years. It reached its highest closing price on November 20 at $473.83 per share. A natural question arises: Why not short MSTR? How would a short strategy have performed since that time? To explore this, I\u2019ll use put options rather than shorting the stock directly. One reason is that calculating the cost of shorting is more complex, as it depends on the interest rates used in equity lending. Additionally, put options are easier to track over time since their prices are reported daily. Finally, I find put options to be a more effective instrument because the potential loss is limited and known in advance, unlike shorting, where the loss can, in theory, be unlimited. As a baseline, note that the price of MSTR on November 20 was $473.83, while on March 12, 2025, it had fallen to $262.55\u2014a decline of 44.59%. So, surely a put option would offer a high return, right? Let\u2019s start by considering a long-term put. Suppose a short seller was uncertain when MSTR would decline and purchased a put option with a $500 strike price on November 20, 2024, expiring 13 months later on December 19, 2025. This option yielded a return of 4%. That\u2019s because it had an ask price of $249.80 on November 20 and a bid price of $259.90 on March 12. Despite the significant decline in MSTR\u2019s stock price over that period, the long-term put returned little. You might think the low return is due to the long expiration period. And you\u2019d be right\u2014options with shorter expirations offer higher returns if the underlying stock moves in the right direction, making the option more in the money. But what expiration date should we choose to maximize returns? MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 - Patch 8 Is Big, Beautiful And Sad Northern Lights Alert For 17 States After \u2018Double Eruption\u2019 On Sun Let\u2019s fix the expiration date at March 21, 2025. Our goal is to find the return from buying a put option on November 20, 2024, when MSTR closed at its peak. But which strike price should we select? There are many, even for the March 21 expiration. To answer this, I downloaded the bid and ask prices for all MSTR put options with a buy date of November 20, 2024, a sell date of March 12, 2025, and an expiration date of March 21, 2025. I then calculated the return for each option, assuming a purchase at the ask price and a sale at the bid price. This produced a graph of returns by strike price, shown at the start of this article. The maximum return came from the put option with a $520 strike price, yielding a 27% return. While that may seem high, it\u2019s surprisingly low considering the stock itself declined by 44.59% over the same period. Comparison with Tesla To understand why the return from shorting MSTR is relatively low, let\u2019s compare it to Tesla. Tesla closed at $428.22 on January 15, 2025, and three weeks later, it closed at $328.50 on February 11, 2025\u2014a decline of 23.29%. A Tesla put option with a strike price of $370 and an expiration date of February 14, 2025, would have returned 300%. Tesla declined even further to $281.95 on February 27, 2025. A Tesla put option with a strike price of $325 and an expiration date of February 28, 2025\u2014purchased on January 15 and sold on February 27\u2014would have generated a 779% return. Another put option, with a strike price of $260 and expiring on March 21, 2025, could have been bought for $1.89 on January 15, when Tesla closed at $428.22, and sold for $40.80 on March 10, when Tesla traded at $222.15, yielding a return of 2,059%. Granted, this scenario involves perfectly timing both the high and low. However, the point remains: Even with perfect timing on MSTR, you wouldn\u2019t come close to achieving the kinds of returns seen from shorting Tesla. So, what\u2019s going on? Ultimately, option prices depend on many factors, but most importantly, the stock price and its volatility. When MSTR reached its global maximum on November 20, 2024, its volatility was at an all-time high\u2014alongside its price. That elevated volatility drove up the price of the options. This makes sense, as option pricing reflects risk; it's essentially the cost of insurance. Market makers must account for the risk of large payouts if options end up deep in the money. While Tesla also hit an all-time high in January, it reached that level more gradually than MSTR, resulting in lower relative volatility. The key takeaway is that volatility plays a crucial role, not just the stock price itself. Because bitcoin is highly volatile, and MSTR even more so, that volatility impacts option returns in subtle but significant ways, setting them apart from other securities and assets.

Hugging Face plans to sell the robot and will also allow developers to download, modify, and suggest improvements to its code. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for robotics to be as open source as possible,\u201d says Cl\u00e9ment Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face. \u201cWhen you think about physical objects doing physical things at work and at home, the level of trust and transparency I need is much higher than for something I chat with on my laptop.\u201d Simon Alibert and R\u00e9mi Cadene are research engineers in AI and robotics at Hugging Face. Courtesy of Hugging Face In videos shared by Pollen Robotics, Reachy 2 can be seen performing tricks like tidying coffee mugs and picking up fruit . Matthieu Lapeyre, cofounder and CEO of Pollen Robotics, says several leading AI companies are using Reachy 2 to research robotic manipulation, although he says he can\u2019t name them due to confidentiality agreements. The ultimate goal is for people to use descendants of Reachy 2 in their homes. Courtesy of Hugging Face Lapeyre says selling humanoid robots remains challenging, because the use cases are unclear and the systems are still unreliable\u2014though some companies are starting to find success. Today, the technology is mostly developed by a few well-financed companies, including Tesla, Figure, and Agility Robotics. \u201cWith Hugging Face, we hope to democratize that,\u201d he says. Many AI models, software frameworks, and tools that researchers and engineers rely on to build AI models and applications are already open source. This means the models are shared free of charge, with licenses that allow the code to be modified and reused. Making hardware open source typically means releasing designs, component details, and 3D models that allow pieces to be manufactured more easily. The availability of powerful open-weight AI models (meaning downloadable but not necessarily fully open source) has made it easier for researchers and startups to experiment with cutting-edge AI, as they can see how models work and modify the code. Delangue says that Hugging Face believes something similar is needed in robotics. \u201cHopefully open source can unleash a wide and diverse range of [new robot] capabilities,\u201d he says. Lapeyre adds that open-sourcing hardware has a similar effect. Robot developers \u201ccan [3D] print a part if something is broken,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cif something is not perfect, they can make it a bit better by adding a new part.\u201d The current AI boom has coincided with renewed interest in robotics, as the latest models help enable new advances in the capabilities of hardware systems. Some prominent researchers argue that AI will need a physical presence in order to match or surpass human intelligence, because that advancement may require a direct understanding of the physical world. The hype surrounding humanoid robots has led to some dubious claims. Some of the companies racing to build humanoid robots have posted demo videos on social media that seem to promise incredible abilities. But experts warn that such videos could be misleading. A system that seems extraordinary online could in fact be tele-operated by a person off camera. It could also fail if conditions change even slightly or be unable to complete a task reliably. Delangue says the open source approach should make progress more transparent. \u201cYou can\u2019t cheat; you can\u2019t hide with open source,\u201d he says. Hugging Face already hosts some open source robotics code. Delangue says that use of this code has spiked over the past year, reflecting growing interest in robotics generally. Some robotics researchers, especially those in academia, favor the open approach. \u201cMaking robotics more accessible increases the velocity with which technology advances,\u201d says Sergey Levine, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley and cofounder of Physical Intelligence, a startup working to develop vastly more capable and general purpose robotic models . Physical Intelligence made the first of its robot foundation models, Pi0, available on Hugging Face in February. The model allows a range of different robots to learn to do a variety of physical tasks. Levine says that researchers in academia and industry have already contributed valuable ideas and tweaks to his product. He adds there is potential for outsiders to contribute to the development of new hardware as well. \u201cThere's a lot more creativity people can apply to how they build the actual physical hardware,\u201d he says. The open approach appears to be gaining momentum across the AI industry. Meta was the first major AI company to offer a cutting edge open weight model when it released Llama in 2023. Several other cutting edge open-weight models have followed. In January, a relatively unknown Chinese startup called DeepSeek shocked the tech industry and the stock market by releasing a powerful AI model that was reportedly developed at less cost than those made by US firms. Even OpenAI , the company at the center of the current boom, which has kept its most powerful models a closely guarded secret, said in March that it would change its approach and release a free, open-weight model this summer.

China has 4 main players with robotaxi service, dominated by Baidu (the Chinese Google.) A recent session at last week\u2019s Ride AI conference in Los Angeles revealed some details about the different regulatory regime in China, and featured a report from a Chinese-American Youtuber who has taken on a mission to ride in the different vehicles. Zion Maffeo, deputy general counsel for Pony.AI, provided some details on regulations in China. While Pony began with U.S. operations, its public operations are entirely in China, and it does only testing in the USA. Famously it was one of the few companies to get a California \u201cno safety driver\u201d test permit, but then lost it after a crash, and later regained it. Chinese authorities at many levels keep a close watch over Chinese robotaxi companies. They must get approval for all levels of operation which control where they can test and operate, and how much supervision is needed. Operation begins with testing with a safety driver behind the wheel (as almost everywhere in the world,) with eventual graduation to having the safety driver in the passenger seat but with an emergency stop. Then they move to having a supervisor in the back seat before they can test with nobody in the vehicle, usually limited to an area with simpler streets. Panel at Ride AI conference discusses Chinese robotaxis, including Sophia Tung and Zion Maffeo on ... More the right, and moderator Sophie Schmidt and Helen Pan of Baidu Apollo on left. Brad Templeton MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 - Patch 8 Is Big, Beautiful And Sad Northern Lights Alert For 17 States After \u2018Double Eruption\u2019 On Sun The big jump can then come to allow testing with nobody in the vehicle, but with full time monitoring by a remote employee who can stop the vehicle. From there they can graduate to taking passengers, and then expanding the service to more complex areas. Later they can go further, and not have full time remote monitoring, though there do need to be remote employees able to monitor and assist part time. Pony has a permit allowing it to have 3 vehicles per remote operator, and has one for 15 vehicles in process, but they declined comment on just how many vehicles they actually have per operator. Baidu also did not respond to queries on this. No U.S. regulation is that strict, though US companies have followed similar paths, though most have not bothered with having employees in the vehicle but not behind the wheel, as that\u2019s more of a gimmick that something that improves safety. (Some companies which have vehicles with no steering wheel have had, or still have, operations with an employee on board who can stop the vehicle but is unable to grab a wheel.) U.S. permits in California have far fewer stages, with permits for testing, testing with no safety driver, and carrying passengers with or without a safety driver. Some states, like Arizona and Texas have almost no specific regulations. While Waymo and Cruise never made any explicit statements, it is widely believed that when they did their first operations with no employee aboard, they used full time remote monitoring. This is a the prudent thing to do, and is the plan for companies like Aurora and Waabi which have both declared they will operate trucks with no safety driver aboard this year. It is unknown when Waymo stopped having full time remote monitoring, and in fact they have not officially declared it, though based on operational incidents, they obviously don\u2019t, and nor did Cruise (or their dragging incident would be unlikely to have happened.) In addition, Chinese jurisdictions require that the system in a car independently log any \u201cinterventions\u201d by safety drivers in a sort of \u201cblack box\u201d system. These reports are regularly given to regulators, though they are not made public. In California, companies must file an annual disengagement report, but they have considerable leeway on what they consider a disengagement so the numbers can\u2019t be readily compared. Chinese companies have no discretion on what is reported, and they may notify authorities of a specific objection if they wish to declare that an intervention logged in their black box should not be counted. There are strong arguments against such strict reporting. Safety drivers are told to intervene when they have any doubt, which means they will frequently intervene when not necessary. Because companies with mandatory reporting of all interventions want to keep their number down, they may, even unconsciously, discourage interventions. They also don\u2019t want to have to count things like bathroom breaks which have no bearing on safety, leading to the wrong incentive. On the other hand, giving companies full leeway on what counts led to essentially useless reports in California. The right answer is hard. This more strict regulation reportedly also has its own Chinese \u201cflavour\u201d and personal relationships are also important to get permits and deploy. Even so, it\u2019s not slowing things down much, if at all. User Experience Sophia Tung is a YouTuber who is fluent in English and Mandarin and has traveled to China to try the Chinese robotaxis, and has also used them in the USA. Only a modest number of experienced users have had the chance to do this, so it\u2019s good that Ms. Tung has made videos of her experiences. Her first Chinese trip involved a Baidu 5th generation car. Her overall impression was that vehicle, and the service around it were unacceptably poor. However, a return trip involved using Baidu\u2019s newer 6th generation vehicle which she reports is much better; the best of all the Chinese players, and closer to Waymo in quality, though not quite at its level. Her first trip involved limited service, very long wait times, and poor ride quality, but the 6th generation vehicle, in Wuhan, did much better. Oddly, she also rode 5th generation vehicles in Wuhan on her 2nd trip, and they were still of low quality in her view. They have fewer LIDARs and quite probably less compute resources. It\u2019s possible they also haven\u2019t received the newest software because of their old hardware. Baidu did not respond to queries for this story. Tung also got a chance to ride with other players. She found a WeRide Robobus to nearly match the Baidu Apollo ride, though WeRide\u2019s robotaxi wasn\u2019t quite as good. It was at a similar level to the Pony.AI robotaxi in her estimation. The Waymo ride ranks ahead of all of these, and the Baidu Apollo 5th generation vehicle well below. While Cruise is gone, she rode it during its day and felt it was a little worse than the Pony and WeRide robotaxis, but better than the 5th generation Baidu. She has not ridden with AutoX, which has been operating in the Pingshan area of Shenzhen. There has been only limited news recently about AutoX. Of course, it\u2019s important to remember that single experiences and videos tell us only a very limited amount about the quality of a robotaxi. If anything serious goes wrong, you can conclude the vehicle is still very immature. A mature vehicle will drive flawlessly when it comes to major issues like safety and getting stuck or blocking traffic. While all vehicles still make errors, in mature vehicles the errors should be so rare that the odds of an individual encountering one should be quite low. Only bulk statistics can help measure the quality of these vehicles, and none of the Chinese companies release them. (Waymo and Cruise do/did release them, though Tesla, May and Motional do not.) It\u2019s also worth noting that Tung waxed enthusiastically about other elements in the Baidu vehicle not related to the ride quality, such as built in massage chairs, and their use of battery swap (which is much more common in China than elsewhere.) This is impressive considering that Baidu reports their robotaxi only costs around $28,000 to make. Forbes Baidu Launches New $28,000 Robotaxi In Wuhan By Brad Templeton Her enthusiasm raises the question of how much \u201ccomfort features\u201d of Robotaxis will matter when the market gets competitive. She said she would definitely prefer a vehicle with massage, though it\u2019s less clear if that would be preferred with a longer wait time or higher cost. Zoox has bet big on designing its own custom vehicle in order to deliver the best experience they can compared to traditional car forms. Waymo also planned to use a more spacious vehicle from China\u2019s Zeekr, but has apparently scaled back those plans after 100% tariffs were put on Chinese EVs by President Biden, and now have been made higher by President Trump.

The protest sign humorously captured the attention of Elon Musk, highlighting the irony of the demand. Tesla CEO, facing massive criticism due to his controversial role in the Trump administration, instead of taking offence, Musk did what he does best, and joined the meme-fest. Elon Musk did not stop there and went forward with the 'Go to Mars' joke. Elon Musk shared another related post on Twitter. The protests against Elon Musk and his electric vehicle company Tesla have been facing massive protests in US, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world. This Saturday too, hundreds of people protested outside Tesla stores in these countries, \"World Day Against Elon Musk\", denouncing the billionaire entrepreneur. The Tesla boss has now responded to the same. An X, formerly known as Twitter, user named DogeDesigner, who recently shares posts on the tech mogul shared one of the quite common posters from Tesla protests. The poster reads ' SEND MUSK TO MARS '. \u2014 cb_doge (@cb_doge) Sharing the image, DogeDesigner wrote on Twitter: \"Who exactly are they yelling at to send Musk to Mars?

Musk did not stop there and went forward with the 'Go to Mars' joke. Elon Musk shared another related post on Twitter. He shared a Ghibli photo of himself and son X. In the photo, X is wearing a T-shair with 'Occupy Mars' written on it. DogeDesigner shared another post that said: Mars will be called the \u201cNew World\u201d. To this, Elon Musk replied in affirmation, writing 'Yes'.

The firm has licensed four promising obesity therapies from China, which is emerging as a pharmaceutical research and development powerhouse. And having ready-made drugs should enable Kailera to move fast in an increasingly competitive market. Global sales of weight loss drugs swelled 50% last year and could more than triple again by 2028, research shows. \u201cWe have probably the most advanced, diverse, late-stage pipeline that is focused exclusively on weight management, outside of Big Pharma,\u201d says Ron Renaud, the all-star former biotech stock analyst hired to run the company. FIRST UP Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (2nd R) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick look on as President Donald Trump speaks after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025 in Washington, D.C. SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images After the Trump Administration\u2019s trade policy for electronics shifted multiple times over the weekend, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping criticized Trump\u2019s tariffs and called for the protection of \u201cthe multilateral trading system\u201d in an op-ed as the Chinese leader seeks allies. Xi met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez Friday and urged the EU to \u201coppose unilateral bullying practices,\u201d and is wrapping up a diplomatic visit in Vietnam where he made a similar case. Investors are turning to safe havens as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs shake up the global markets, but their preferences are shifting . Gold prices hit a new record Friday, but the U.S. dollar fell to its lowest level since April 2022. \u201cWhat is potentially being compromised is the post-World War II order of international finance where the dollar has been the central pillar\u201d of the global economy, said Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank\u2019s chief strategist.

BUSINESS + FINANCE Consumer sentiment has taken a hit from the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariffs, falling to its lowest level in nearly three years this month, according to a recent University of Michigan survey. The survey shows consumer sentiment down 30% in April compared to where it stood at the end of the Biden Administration in January. Trump\u2019s trade war could have an impact on the president\u2019s constellation of foreign properties , as the tourism industry, which is already showing cracks, could slow down worldwide. But as he paused his latest levies, all 13 countries where Trump does business have signaled at least some willingness to negotiate with the U.S. WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP ANDREJS ZAVADSKIS FOR FORBES Dutch billionaire Remon Vos, a newcomer to Forbes\u2019 2025 World\u2019s Billionaires List, has grown his firm CTP into the second-largest industrial and logistics real estate developer in Europe, earning him a fortune worth an estimated $5.9 billion . And the company is likely to benefit from tariffs in the long term, as companies who want to sell to Europe will have to build their factories there to avoid higher import duties. TECH + INNOVATION \u200b\u200b The fintech industry\u2019s adoption of AI has been slow as a result of regulatory and compliance hurdles, but a new trend is emerging: using AI for deep investment research . It\u2019s still hard to tell which early-stage startup will live up to the hype, but they\u2019re all addressing labor-intensive tasks where improvements are long overdue. Tesla appeared to remove a feature on its website in China allowing customers to purchase two car models the company imports from the U.S. as the trade war between the two countries escalates.

DAILY COVER STORY Elon Musk Wants To Raise The Birth Rate. He\u2019s Cutting Medical Care For Mothers And Babies. ANDREW HARNIK/GETTY IMAGES When Sevonna Brown learned that Elon Musk\u2019s quasi-governmental agency DOGE had ordered payment stopped on her more than $2 million NIH grant for maternal community healthcare, she started hitting the phones. The network of services for mothers and children that Brown had spent more than a decade building was coming to a screeching halt. Given Musk\u2019s endless warnings that falling birthrates pose an existential threat to civilization, DOGE\u2019s abrupt gutting of maternal health services is simultaneously ironic, and exactly what you\u2019d expect from an effort whose blunders far exceed its claimed, but typically unverifiable, achievements. Musk has donated millions of dollars to fund research on fertility. But at this point, he has taken much more from pregnant women and new mothers than he has given. In February, DOGE threatened a seven-year, $168 million NIH initiative to improve maternal health across the state of Michigan. It suspended more than $27 million in grants to women\u2019s health centers, laid off federal workers running programs for expecting mothers on Medicaid, and cancelled $1.6 million in funding for maternal and postpartum care at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. \u201cWe can\u2019t claim to care about birthrates while defunding the very systems that make pregnancy, birth and parenting safe,\u201d says Emilie Rodriguez. A medical anthropologist, doula, and co-founder of The Bridge Directory, a group of perinatal maternal healthcare providers, Rodriguez worked with Sevonna Brown on the CHAMP Center of Excellence grant. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cThe Department of Government Efficiency is supposed to be about cutting fat from the federal budget,\u201d says Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White. \u201cHere, it\u2019s cutting out vital organs : medical interventions that save lives and help pregnant women have children safely.\u201d MORE Elon Musk Is A Billionaire Federal Welfare Vampire FACTS + COMMENTS It\u2019s been a volatile time for investors since President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d as the S&P 500 netted a more than 5% loss from April 2 through Friday. But some stocks have performed better than others: 90%: The share of stocks on the S&P 500 that declined during that period 50: The number of above-water stocks in that time, dominated by healthcare stocks as well as bargain retailers and defense contractors 34%: The drop in pharmaceutical developer Charles River Laboratories\u2019 stock, making it the worst performing on the S&P since April 2 STRATEGY + SUCCESS Investors are reeling from the fallout over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs , and while it\u2019s typical to take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach, proactively navigating the uncertainty is possible for those who are patient and forward-thinking. Leaders should absorb that anxiety without passing it on. A manager\u2019s ability to guide their team through turbulence and provide support for employees can help improve overall well-being.

Sign up to get it in your inbox. getty M uch of the news on climate has been discouraging of late. Europe had its warmest-ever March. President Trump is pushing to ramp up mining and use of coal, the most carbon-intense energy source. His administration is also gutting environmental rules, curbing climate research and trying to stop state programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas pollution. But there\u2019s promising news on efforts to cut down on harmful methane emissions generated by cows and other livestock. Globally, cattle are the single largest source of agricultural methane emissions, and efforts are underway to reduce that problem with new types of feeds and improved management of their manure. But the Bezos Earth Fund and Global Methane Hub kicked off a $27.4 million program that\u2019s aimed at breeding cattle and other farm animals that are naturally less gassy. The initiative will provide grants in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Oceania to identify and prioritize the breeding of animals with biological traits that cause them to produce less methane. Within every herd, some animals produce up to 30% less methane than others and selecting and breeding for these traits could lead to substantial cuts in emissions. This means farmers won\u2019t have to change how they feed and raise their animals, making it an easy, no-cost pathway to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cReducing methane from cattle is one of the most elegant solutions we have to slow climate change,\u201d Andy Jarvis, director of the Bezos Earth Fund\u2019s Future of Food program, said in a statement. The Big Read AFP via Getty Images Tesla Cybertruck Sales See A Sharp Dive Tesla\u2019s stock has slid steadily this year, hurt by declining sales and widespread protests over CEO Elon Musk\u2019s leadership of President Trump\u2019s DOGE initiative, which is making haphazard staffing and budget cuts to federal agencies. The electric vehicle maker\u2019s sharp-edged Cybertruck is also sliding, posting sharply lower sales in the year\u2019s first quarter. The Austin-based company delivered just 6,406 Cybertrucks this year through March, according to Cox Automotive. That\u2019s more than double its volume in the year-earlier period, when it was slowly starting to make the hard-to-build model. But the quarterly figure was less than half of what it sold in either the third or fourth quarter of 2024\u201314,416 and 12,991 units, respectively\u2013as its production ramped up. Musk had previously forecast that annual sales of the electric pickup might average 250,000 a year, though it delivered only about 39,000 last year. A combination of multiple recalls\u2013including one last month to fix stainless steel body panels that fell off due to faulty glue\u2013and the likelihood of sharply higher costs for steel, aluminum and imported auto parts due to Trump\u2019s tariffs, suggest Tesla will struggle to boost sales of a model that can sell for about $100,000. Weak demand has also led to an inventory of about 2,400 unsold new Cybertrucks, according to auto news site Jalopnik. Read more here Hot Topic World Economic Forum/Mattias Nutt Tania Strauss, head food and water at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Centre for Nature and Climate, on water scarcity challenges It\u2019s easy to recognize water scarcity in times of drought, but how can we manage rising demand for it from things like data centers and manufacturing as well as population growth? It\u2019s often invisible, but water is vital for industry and society in terms of our health and running our economies and our cities. Just starting to think about the wider water or hydrological cycle being off-kilter, which science is showing us that it is, has a far-reaching impact in ways I think people haven't properly understood. When you're thinking about trends in the consumption of water, you have to look at the bigger picture and say we're experiencing the water cycle being off-kilter\u2013through too much due to flooding and unpredictable weather patterns, extreme weather, or too little water, both in the form of scarcity and in the changing ways in which we can access it. And then, too, polluted water, which in developing countries can be in the form of wastewater that's going untreated and in developed countries can be in the form of contamination of drinking water. It's really touching on literally every industry, every community, every country. Having that wider narrative on the issues around water is important. When you start to get into the consumption trends, 70% plus of water consumption is going into producing our food. The rest is being pushed around for industrial use, and that has challenges. The third is really around cities. If you go industry by industry and start to look at what that means, there is the kind of classic competition for almost every basin on earth from industries like mining and agriculture and manufacturing. Then you have some of these emerging industries that are starting to both operate in water-stressed regions and use water within the ingredients of their business model, like fast fashion, AI and data centers. There\u2019s growing pressure, and we know now that in the next five years, by 2030, we're going to exceed our supply of water with an increased 40% in demand. So how do we reconcile the kinds of solutions that help us reinvent water management and also use much more circular thinking in the way we are approaching some of those problems? What\u2019s the answer? Companies have been more and more cognizant of their footprint, not only in terms of the water they're using within their supply chains but the fact that the communities and the basins where they now need to go and operate are so under stress that they're just not going to have that access. So even though [government] policy may or may not be addressing some of that, you are starting to see it on the industry side, whether it's concrete, whether it's energy or manufacturing, I think they have a little bit more of a real understanding of the cost of water and maybe in a better version of this in the future, the value of water. We need to look at this both around the governance of water, around the fit for purpose finance needed for water, the basin level or sort of waterway specific partnerships that need to happen, at least on the industry side in a pre-competitive way. Then also looking at the tools and the technologies, the policy nexus that can help enable new early-stage tech, but also innovation more broadly toward those outcomes. In terms of sparks of hope, where we're seeing good innovation, I think it's on a number of fronts. One is less sexy, which is that we need cooperation to happen. It isn't some breakthrough, deep-tech solution. We just need people to recognize that they have skin in the game, and they need to come around the table and solve for this.

This \"omnigenius\" fallacy overlooks the crucial role of context in success. Leaders often struggle when switching industries, as seen with John Sculley at Apple and Ron Johnson at JCPenney, proving that skills are often context-specific, and transferring them is not always successful. Reuters Elon Musk Elon Musk \u2019s misadventures with DOGE might be the ultimate example of a powerful flaw in how we think about leaders. That\u2019s our tendency to believe skills and accomplishments are portable, that someone who excels in one venue will be just as impressive in others. I call this exceptional \u2014 if imaginary \u2014 superpower \u201comnigenius.\u201d In reality, though, success doesn\u2019t exist without context. While there\u2019s no pleasure in watching Musk make a mess of the US government, maybe it will help clarify the crucial link between the two. Musk and DOGE show how a leader can be empowered by the omnigenius fantasy. Musk has surely done remarkable things. For all Tesla Inc.\u2019s current struggles, it transformed the automotive sector. And it\u2019s almost impossible to overstate SpaceX\u2019s revolutionary impact on the space industry. Once he joined the government, though, the story changed. In just one notable example, DOGE fired hundreds of employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for the production and security of nuclear weapons and management of nuclear waste sites. But the Trump administration reversed many of the cuts less than 48 hours later, when it became clear what these workers did and how important their roles are. \u201cThe DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\u201d said Arms Control Association Executive Director Daryl Kimball at the time. Similarly, cuts to programs providing healthcare for 9/11 responders and survivors were later reversed, as were those to Social Security offices. Even DOGE\u2019s website had to delete all five of its biggest claims to savings after media organizations pointed out they were wrong. Live Events Whatever you think of DOGE, we should all agree that accidentally damaging the agency in charge of American nuclear weapons is incompetent execution. And Musk isn\u2019t alone. It\u2019s become routine to see people with private sector successes deferred to as they regurgitate Russian propaganda on Ukraine or spread debunked anti-vaccine theories. This isn\u2019t just about business \u2014 the omnigenius myth runs deep in our culture. In Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Comics Universe, Bruce Banner remarks that he has seven PhDs, an (absurd) shorthand for his multifold genius. (Having personally done just one, the prospect of earning a second could turn me into a giant green rage-monster, too.) On TV, how many times have you watched a character who\u2019s an expert in \u201cscience,\u201d do everything from sequence DNA to hack a computer? And don\u2019t forget the celebrities many of us trust to sell us everything from snacks to cars to prescription drugs. But outside of the arenas that brought them success, why do we listen to these people? And why should they get positions of power in areas where they have little knowledge or experience? The explanation lies in a cognitive bias known as \u201cthe Halo Effect ,\u201d a phenomenon where having one major positive quality tends to skew our perception of someone\u2019s other characteristics. That\u2019s because we often correlate unrelated characteristics, such as intelligence, attractiveness, social skills and loyalty. So if someone is, for instance, particularly attractive, there\u2019s a tendency to rate them as more intelligent, even with no evidence to suggest that\u2019s the case. The halo effect makes us attribute success solely to the person, rather than to the combination of that person and the context he or she inhabits. But context is, virtually always, overwhelmingly important. This is why leaders who switch industries usually struggle. John Sculley sold soda brilliantly at PepsiCo Inc. but nearly derailed Apple Inc. Ron Johnson revolutionized retail at Apple, then tanked JCPenney. In both cases, the CEOs\u2019 latter companies lost more than half their market value during their leadership . Harvard Business School Professors Boris Groysberg and Nitin Nohria looked at people recruited from GE (at the time the pinnacle of American management) to be CEOs of other companies. They found that the leaders succeeded only when the challenges facing their new employer were similar to those they\u2019d encountered at GE. Context is so important that it has a huge effect even when people move within an industry. Other research by Groysberg showed that when most star equity research analysts change banks, their performance drops because the skills that allowed them to excel were actually bank-specific. And my own research shows that leaders who come from outside of a company (as opposed to being promoted from within) tend to produce high-variance outcomes: Sometimes they succeed brilliantly, but more often, they are disastrous failures. Because of the importance of context, success in one area provides almost no information about someone\u2019s ability to succeed in a different one. It is possible to change fields successfully. (Deion Sanders, after all, played in both the Super Bowl and the World Series.) But the odds aren\u2019t good. So, stop seeing haloes. Being a great investor or CEO doesn\u2019t make someone an expert in foreign policy, biomedicine or tax rates. Success is important \u2014 but so is understanding that the limits of any one person\u2019s abilities are usually much narrower than we think.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The new week is off to a silent start as bitcoin looks to establish a foothold above the trendline, characterizing the downtrend line from record highs, with $86K emerging as resistance over the weekend. FLR, TRX and SOL beat the broader market, while the RWA protocol Mantra's OM token tanked during the Asian hours. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

Mantra blamed the 90% crash to 70 cents on forced liquidations on crypto exchanges, while blockchain sleuth Spot On Chain pointed to a significant movement of coins to crypto exchange OKX three days before the crash. Meanwhile, OKX's CEO Star Xu calle d the OM token collapse a major scandal for the entire crypto industry, stressing that all on-chain data is publicly available for scrutiny across major exchanges. In other news, data tracked by IntoTheBlock showed a renewed uptick in transaction volumes on Virtuals Protocol, a blockchain project enabling the creation, ownership, and deployment of AI agents. Data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence said that Mechanism's Capital Andrew Kang doubled his bullish bet on BTC, now holding a long worth $200 million. New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) discussed the relative stability of the crypto market and its orderly behavior during last week's carnage in the traditional markets, saying it could become a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle. Still, some investors anticipate a range-bound trading pattern for bitcoin (BTC) due to concerns that the U.S.-China trade tensions will not be resolved quickly. This follows President Trump's late Friday decision to exempt certain products from Chinese tariffs, a gesture perceived as a willingness to negotiate. \"BTC continues to consolidate within the $80k-$90k range and could continue trading sideways, adopting a \"wait and see\" approach to the tariff situation,' QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast, noting the weekend demand for the $100K calls. Per Bloomberg's Lisa Abramovicz, there is deep skepticism in cheering Trump's late Friday pivot. \"This is still a sell rallies environment. Tariff uncertainty, growth weakness, a Fed risking policy errors in both directions and fund outflows all suggest wider spreads ahead,\" Abramovic quoted Deutsche Bank's Credit Analyst Steve Caprio as saying. Some market participants expressed concerns about the dwindling demand for the spot bitcoin ETFs, which registered an outflow of over $700 million last week, according to data source Farside Investors. \"ETF demand is cooling. A sharp drop in bitcoin spot ETF assets signals institutional outflows. Watch this trend closely,\" blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant said on X. Lastly, major U.S. equity indexes, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, appeared headed for the death cross, a bearish technical pattern involving the 50-day simple moving average's (SMA) move below the 200-day SMA and the dollar index looked oversold as per the 14-day relative strength index. Both observations called for caution in risk assets. The key events and data to watch out for the week ahead are Monday's stock market reaction to Trump's tariff exclusions, Wednesday's U.S. retail sales and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech and earnings reports on Wall Street on Friday.

Since April 7, 2025, 17 wallets, including two linked to Laser Digital (a MANTRA investor), deposited 43.6M $OM tokens ($227M, 4.5% of circulating supply) into exchanges like OKX and Binance, just before a major price crash, raising suspicions of insider selling or manipulation. Who dropped the price of $OM ? Before the $OM crash(since Apr 7), at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6M $OM ($227M at the time) into exchanges, 4.5% of the circulating supply. According to Arkham\u2019s tag, 2 of these addresses are linked to Laser Digital. Laser Digital is a strategic\u2026 pic.twitter.com/zB8yAPRPSO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 14, 2025 The MANTRA team denied involvement, attributing the crash to \u201creckless liquidations\u201d by exchanges during low-liquidity hours, claiming their tokens remain locked and verifiable on-chain, though community trust is shaken. Investors expressed devastation on X, with users such as @Jeetburner, claiming to have lost over $3.5 million. Critics accused MANTRA and Binance of a \u201cliquidity exit\u201d and threatened legal action, while MANTRA\u2019s Telegram group closed to new users. The incident may impact credibility in the RWA sector as real-world bigwigs - such as UAE real estate giant DAMAC, in Mantra's case - keep wary of projects with volatile token prices. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates for more major tokens, excluding XRP, remain mildly positive below the annualized 10%, reflecting a moderately bullish positioning. BTC's rally has stalled near $85K in the past 24 hours. Futures open interest has dropped from $16.4 billion to $15 billion, a sign that traders are taking some risk off the table. XRP's recovery since April 7 has not been backed by an uptick in open interest, raising questions in the market about the sustainability of gains. On Deribit, the short-term BTC and ETH options skew remains negative, but the so-called put bias has weakened significantly since last Monday. The mid-term and longer-term skews have flipped back in favor of calls.

Police were notified of a suspicious man at Agua Caliente Casino after security guards were approached by a man traveling in a Tesla who said he\u2019d \u201cbe responsible for a bombing\u201d at the festival, according to police.

Investigators used Flock ALPR cameras to track the man\u2019s movements through the Coachella Valley and located his car in Palm Springs shortly after midnight. He was arrested in the city, and a subsequent search of his vehicle showed that no weapons, explosives, or bomb-making materials were in his possession. The man, who was identified as 40-year-old Davis Darvish of Santa Monica, was arrested and charged with making bomb threats. He is being held on $1 million bail.

The victims gathered at their mosque in Johns Creek on Monday to discuss the new developments. The Brief Lawyers for three Muslim women who were harassed by the ex-husband of the U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have reached a settlement with the lawmaker's former spouse over the incident. The incident, captured on the Muslim holiday of Eid ul Fitr, shows Greene shouting offensive remarks at a group of women wearing hijabs from a Tesla Cybertruck, sparking widespread outrage. Greene has previously publicly and privately apologized for his statements and said he hoped the women would forgive him. ALPHARETTA, Ga. - Three Muslim college students who were verbally harassed while praying outside the Avalon shopping center in Alpharetta have reached a $75,000 settlement with Perry Greene, the ex-husband of Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. During a news conference Monday in Johns Creek, attorneys for the women and representatives from CAIR Georgia revealed new details about the case and its resolution. The women said Greene contacted them through their attorneys after the video began circulating online. He later apologized to them privately and issued a public apology earlier this month. RAW: Ex-husband of Marjorie Taylor Greene settles harassment complaint Attorneys representing the 3 women who were verbally attacked by the ex-husband of Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene held a press conference Monday to announce a settlement from Perry Greene. PREVIOUS: Ex-husband of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene apologizes to Muslim women In addition to the apology, Greene agreed to pay the women $75,000, which they have since donated to their local mosque. The women said they believe Greene was sincere in his apology and expressed hope that the incident could serve as a broader lesson in tolerance and respect. \"Today, I want to tell Mr. Greene that we accept his apology, and we hope that he will continue to treat others with fairness, respect, equality and dignity,\" one of the women said during the press conference. Settlement over verbal attack caught on video The ex-husband of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has reached a settlement with three Muslim women after he was caught on camera verbally harassing them while they were trying to pray in an Alpharetta parking garage. The backstory: The confrontation occurred in late March at the Avalon mall in Alpharetta. The three women, who were wearing hijabs, had pulled into a quiet area of the parking lot to pray when the altercation unfolded. \"We came here just to enjoy some desserts,\" Nesrine, one of the victims, said. \"It was time for one of the prayers to end, so we wanted to make sure we reached it. We set our carpet up, our prayer rug, right next to our car in an empty parking spot tucked away in the corner.\" Three Muslim women said they were verbally attacked by a stranger in Alpharetta while praying. (FOX 5) The video shows a man leaning out of a Tesla Cybertruck and directing hateful comments at a group of women, including telling them to \"go back to their country.\" The video prompted outrage from community members and civil rights organizations. PREVIOUS STORY: Caught on camera: Man hurls insults at Muslim women praying in Alpharetta Perry Greene settles harassment claim Perry Greene, ex-husband of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, has settled a harassment claim made by 3 Muslim women who were praying when they were verbally attacked by Greene. In early April, Perry Greene apologized at the women's place of worship in Johns Creek during Friday prayer services. Greene met privately with the women, who had requested a public apology after the incident drew widespread attention. What they're saying: \"I just wanted them to know I humbly apologize to them because nobody should be treated that way, and that\u2019s not the way to treat anyone with differences,\" Greene said. \"Hopefully they find it in their hearts to forgive me, and we shouldn\u2019t allow that in our society.\" Man who verbally attacked Muslim women apologizes A mea culpa from the man who verbally attacked three Muslim women earlier this week. The man in a now viral video verbally attacking three Muslim women says he is sorry. He apologized to the three women today at their house of worship and says he hopes they will forgive him. Attorney Ali Awad, who is working with the victims, said Greene has expressed interest in making a donation to a nonprofit combating Islamophobia. \"He has entertained the idea of issuing a donation to a nonprofit battling Islamophobia. Our goal here is education. We do not kick people while they are down,\" Awad said. \"We chose to take the high ground today. We chose peace. We chose to allow Mr. Greene to come to the community and issue an apology directly to the family.\" Greene did not answer questions from the media following the apology. The other side: Ali Awad, the group\u2019s attorney, said his clients chose reconciliation after what they felt was a sincere expression of remorse. \"In the Islamic tradition, when an enemy comes and apologizes and brings their head down and gives you what my clients believe was a sincere apology, we accept it and we move on,\" Awad said. \"In Islam we show grace even to our enemies,\" Nesrine said. \"Our hope is even those who hated us will begin to accept us as equals. Nothing more.\" Supporters say they are choosing peace but want the encounter to be a teaching moment. Azka Mahmood, executive director of the Georgia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the incident is part of a troubling trend. \"Since the genocide in Gaza began, CAIR Georgia has recorded a 250% increase in anti-Muslim incidents in Georgia alone,\" Mahmood said. She said the incident highlighted the urgent need for continued community education against harassment. What's next: The women plan to donate the entire settlement to their mosque. Alpharetta police are not filing charges against Greene for the incident, saying in a statement that \"in our community all speech is protected - even the speech we may not agree with.\" The Source: Information for this story came from a release by CAIR-Georgia and previous FOX 5 reporting.

First it was a lack of stock, then parts, then supply. All of this causes prices to shoot up. Along with rising prices also came the lack of quality. Featured Video With owners complaining about transmission issues and parts being purposely made to be replaced, not fixed, lots started to fill with overpriced new models. Now with tariffs expected to impact not only vehicles made outside the U.S., but the parts inside vehicles as well, car expert and dealer Robb the Car Guy (@robbthecarguy) shared his worry about the auto market on TikTok after visiting a Bank of America repo lot. At the Bank of America repo lot Robb begins his video by expressing his shock at the sheer amount of vehicles at the repo lot. Advertisement \u201cNever seen this many repos in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cCome to the auction every week. I always said the car economy is doing good, but now for the first time I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m in Bank of America\u2019s [repo]. Bank of America has good credit customers. This is franchise dealers making the sale.\u201d In the lot were a variety brand new vehicles ranging from a sports cars to sedans. Then Robb saw the perfect example of the type of cars he found at the repo lot: A brand new Chevy Tahoe with 27,000 miles on it. When he looked inside he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThe inside still smells new. It\u2019s mint!\u201d he said. Advertisement Afterwards he discovered a lot of brand new, mint condition vehicles, ranging from a 2025 Honda with 2,000 miles on it to a brand new Chevrolet Corvette with 6,000 miles on it. \u201cIn order to qualify for these cars you got to make six-figure income,\u201d Robb explained. \u201cThese people are getting their cars repossessed. This is people who care about their credit.\u201d According to Robb, the sheer amount of \u201chigh dollar earners\u201d getting their cars repossesed signaled a serious threat to the future of the car industry. \u201cCars have priced themselves out of the market,\u201d he said. Advertisement What did the viewers think? A lot of viewers in the comments had their own theories for the amount of new cars at a reputable credit lender\u2019s repo lot. The video has amassed over 183,000 views since April 9. \u201c70% are people living above their means,\u201d one said. \u201cGovernment employees getting fired,\u201d another remarked.

It\u2019s not that simple - Poynter Donate Fact-Checking SUVs sit on display at a Ford dealership Friday, April 4, 2025, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher) By: Amy Sherman April 14, 2025 President Donald Trump and his allies have offered a solution for avoiding price hikes because of his car tariffs: buy American. Trump told NBC News March 29 that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if foreign car manufacturers raise prices in response to tariffs. \u201cI hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have plenty.\u201d The administration\u2019s 25% tariff on imported cars took effect April 3, and an additional tariff on imported auto parts is set to take effect May 3. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their cost is often passed down to consumers through higher prices. Fox News\u2019 host Jesse Watters made a similar statement April 3: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried cars are going to cost more, buy American.\u201d Watters cited a clip of Ford Motor Co.\u2019s promotion to temporarily give customers its employee rate on cars. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who owned multiple car dealerships before taking office, echoed Trump in an April 2 CNN interview. Moreno said the \u201conly ones that are mostly hurt are the cars that are made overseas, exclusively, and are shipped into the United States. The ultra luxury cars.\u201d That is contradicted by an analysis by Cox Automotive, a research firm, which found that the \u201c25% tariff on imported vehicles will apply to nearly 80% of vehicles priced under $30,000,\u201d citing models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Trax and Trailblazer, Nissan Sentra and Honda HR-V. Moreno added, among \u201cmainstream cars, a Honda, a Toyota, a Subaru, a Ford, a Chevy, if one car goes up in price, because there\u2019s a tariff? That person will just buy the other one that doesn\u2019t have a tariff, which is your American-made automobile.\u201d Many car experts said it\u2019s not so simple to avoid price increases by buying American, because American autos assembled in the U.S. also use imported parts. \u201cThe concept of an American made car with all parts from the U.S. is a fictional tale,\u201d said Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey will tariff those parts.\u201d Car companies rely on imported parts to varying degrees. For example, the Tesla Model Y has 70% of the value of its parts made in the U.S. or Canada, while the Ford F-150 has 45%. The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists have said it\u2019s unlikely high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans. In response to PolitiFact\u2019s email asking about Moreno\u2019s statement on American-made cars, a Moreno spokesperson attacked PolitiFact and provided no answers to our questions about cars and tariffs. The White House, when contacted, said that some auto parts are exempted from tariffs. Many car manufacturers in the U.S. use imported parts Moreno said U.S. assembled cars that get parts from Mexico and Canada will be \u201ccompletely tariff free\u201d if they comply with the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement that Trump\u2019s administration negotiated in 2018. But many auto parts used in the U.S. come from countries other than Mexico and Canada. Jason Miller, a Michigan State University supply chain management professor, examined auto tariff data and told PolitiFact it showed Mexico \u201cclearly top of the list\u201d for car parts imported into the U.S., but China is No. 2 (because of lithium ion batteries), Japan is 4th, South Korea 5th, and Germany 6th. As of April 10, products imported from China have a 125% tariff . Miller said Trump\u2019s other tariffs on steel and aluminum mean that even if a car were 100% assembled from only domestic components, costs still would rise because steel and aluminum prices are increasing in the U.S. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t oversimplifying things, they are outright lying,\u201d Miller said about people saying car shoppers can purchase all American-made cars. Also, not all auto parts from Mexico comply with the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, so those are being tariffed, too, he said. Amy R. Broglin-Peterson, a Michigan State University expert on supply chain management, said, \u201cAll vehicles use at least some percentage of foreign parts, period. There is no vehicle model that uses 100% American-manufactured parts.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported April 4 that on first glance, Ford is best positioned to weather tariffs because 80% of its cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in America are manufactured domestically, and so are many of the parts. Many components of Ford\u2019s F-150s, such as alternators and wheels, come from other countries, and starting in May those parts could face a new 25% tax, the Journal wrote, \u201cso even though Ford\u2019s trucks are built in the American heartland, import tariffs could jack up the average price by thousands of dollars.\u201d The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publishes data about the U.S. and Canadian content by value of the parts used to assemble passenger motor vehicles in the U.S. and in foreign countries. The data showed that some Toyota car lines built in the U.S., such as Corolla, include at least 25% value of parts imported from Japan. A Toyota spokesperson told PolitiFact that 47% of vehicles the company sold in the U.S. in 2024 were built in the U.S. USA Today analyzed NHTSA data for multiple automakers and found that \u201cfor all models assembled and available for sale in the U.S., 47% of the parts (by value) originated from the U.S. or Canada.\u201d A Cox Automotive spokesperson said that the average American made vehicle has about 50% of its parts or components by value imported. Car prices could rise because of Trump tariffs The tariffs\u2019 long-term effect on the car industry is difficult to predict. Cox Automotive predicted strong sales until pre-tariff inventory declines. \u201cBut all roads lead to this fact: In the coming months and years, as new tariffs settle into place, vehicle prices in the U.S. are expected to increase,\u201d Cox wrote in an April 4 market insights report. Cox predicted that vehicles affected by these tariffs could see prices increase 10% to 15%, and at least a 5% increase for vehicles not subject to the full tariff. \u201cProduction disruptions and declines could be a reality this summer, especially as automakers and suppliers work to align practices with the new rules,\u201d Cox wrote. As prices of cars manufactured in foreign countries rise, producers of competing U.S. models with fewer imported parts will raise their prices, not dollar for dollar, but perhaps 40 cents per dollar, Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted. \u201cU.S. auto manufacturers are hurting, and they will raise prices where they can,\u201d Hufbauer said.

Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter By Red Painter \u2014 April 14, 2025 On the first night of Passover, one of the highest holidays for Jews, the Pennsylvania Governor's mansion was set on fire in a probable act of arson. Why does the first part of my sentence matter? Because the Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, is Jewish. And this crime was committed on Passover, a holiday that commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt and it begins on the first night with a meal called a \"Seder\", during which stories are read from a book called a \"Haggadah\". This meal has many parts and is often HOURS long (my family seders usually went 4-6 hours, depending on how many bottles of wine were consumed. Back to Governor Shapiro. He is Jewish and a Democrat, clearly 2 things that many Trump supporters dislike, so I do not personally believe the night chosen (out of 365) was without symbolism. Here is what the AP is reporting : \"Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement that, while the investigation was ongoing, they were \u201cprepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson.\u201d State police gave no other details about the cause of the fire at the riverfront mansion but said it caused a \u201csignificant amount of damage\u201d to a portion of the residence. Shapiro and his family had been in a different part of the residence, police said.\" The family was awakened by loud bangs on the door at 2am by police who were there to notify and evacuate them. Thankfully all the damage appears to property and no one was hurt. State police are offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Shapiro is a leading contender for the Democratic Party as it seeks out new leaders for the 2028 Presidential election. Will Pam Bondi treat this as seriously as a vandal who attacks a Tesla dealership? My guess is no, especially if it turns out a Trump supporter was to blame. UPDATE: A suspect has been arrested. Cody Balmer, 38 years old, of Harrisburg PA. He will be charged with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, and aggravated assault. Balmer allegedly jumped the fence, thereby avoiding security that was stationed outside, and used homemade incendiary devices. Motive is still unclear. Can you help us out?

Listen to more stories on the Noa app. As the stock markets crashed on Friday, April 4, Donald Trump left Washington, D.C. He did not go to New York to consult with Wall Street. He did not go to Dover, Delaware, to receive the bodies of four American servicemen, killed in an accident while serving in Lithuania. Instead, he went to Florida , where he visited his Doral golf resort, which was hosting the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament, and stayed at his Mar-a-Lago club, where many tournament fans and sponsors were staying too. His private businesses took precedence over the business of the nation. Many of his guests were also interested in boosting Trump\u2019s personal interests, as well as gaining the American president\u2019s favor. One of them was Yasir al-Rumayyan, who runs the $925 billion Saudi sovereign-wealth fund and is also the chair of the LIV tournament. Other sponsors of the tournament included Riyadh Air, a Saudi airline; Aramco, the Saudi state oil company; and, startlingly, TikTok, the Chinese-owned social-media platform whose fate Trump will personally be deciding, even as he profits from its sponsorship and support. Once upon a time (and not even that long ago), blatant conflicts of interest, especially involving foreign entities, were something presidents sought to avoid. No previous inhabitant of the White House would have wanted to be seen doing personal business with companies from countries that seek to influence American foreign policy. Such dealings risk violating the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting \u201cgifts, titles or emoluments from foreign governments.\u201d But during Trump\u2019s first term, the court system largely blew off his commercial entanglements. Now he not only does business with foreign as well as domestic companies that have a direct interest in his policies, he advertises and celebrates them. We know the identities of the golf-tournament sponsors not because investigative journalists burrowed deep into secret contracts, but because they appear on official websites and were displayed on a billboard, observed by The New York Times , at his golf course. Both the website and the billboard would have been scandals in any previous administration. If they are hardly remarked upon now, that\u2019s because Trump\u2019s behavior is a symptom of something much larger. We are living through a revolutionary change, a broad shift away from the transparency and accountability mandated by most modern democracies, and toward the opaque habits and corrupt practices of the autocratic world. For the past decade, American government and business alike have slowly begun to adopt the kleptocratic model pioneered by countries such as Russia and China, where the rulers\u2019 conflicts of interest are simply part of the fabric of the system. The change began during Trump\u2019s first term\u2014Vice President Mike Pence once made a 180-mile-plus detour on a trip to Ireland, in order to stay at a Trump hotel\u2014but Trump was constrained by his advisers and perhaps by what was then still his fear of legal consequences. This time around, he knows he got away with a series of crimes, including an attempt to overthrow an election. His advisers are supine; he feels no more constraints. New standards were already set in December, when the Trump Organization announced the construction of a Trump Tower in Saudi Arabia, an investment that posed a clear conflict of interest for the president-elect. Trump\u2019s family also created a cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, that could, in practice, serve as a vehicle for anyone to pay him indirect bribes. Nobody around him objected. After Trump\u2019s return to office, his administration, unbothered by appearances of impropriety, did indeed quickly suspend a civil investigation into Justin Sun, a Chinese entrepreneur and an adviser to World Liberty Financial, who had also invested at least $75 million in the company. More recently, The Wall Street Journal discovered that executives from Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange, met with Treasury officials to ask for looser oversight, even while they were at the same time negotiating a private business deal with World Liberty Financial. In the past, Binance has been fined $4.3 billion, a record , for letting terrorists, drug traffickers, and people under sanction use its exchange, so the company\u2019s interest in looser oversight is not theoretical. In keeping with the new atmosphere, the inauguration itself became an ostentatious display of the new administration\u2019s kleptocratic values. American tech CEOs were the most prominent guests and got the most attention, but several foreign business partners of the Trump Organization also attended inauguration-related events, posed for photos with Trump, and referenced their connections to his presidency in promotional materials. Several lesser-known companies involved in regulatory and other negotiations with the U.S. government quietly donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Soon afterward, in a late-night purge, Trump fired 17 inspectors general, all people who were responsible for monitoring corruption and ethical violations inside the government. Trump isn\u2019t just disregarding old norms for his own sake. He\u2019s making it easier for others to cut corners too. From the beginning of his career, Trump participated enthusiastically in the opaque, offshore world of shell companies and anonymous bank accounts, a milieu that has always attracted autocrats, criminals, and anyone else who seeks to hide their money. As of 2018, more than one out of every five condos in Trump-branded buildings had been purchased by shell companies whose true owner was unknown, and anonymous owners continued to buy into his businesses during his first term as president. Now his administration is helping other businesses that operate in the shadows to stay there. Trump\u2019s Treasury Department announced last month that it would no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act, hampering recent congressional efforts to end money laundering, tax dodging, and other lawbreaking by anonymous investors. In an executive order, Trump suspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which prohibits American and foreign companies from paying bribes to do business. The Department of Justice is also disbanding a task force set up to administer sanctions on Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. Oversight will be removed from many domestic financial and government institutions too. Trump ordered a full work stoppage at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which had been created to protect consumers from manipulation by banks and other financial institutions He has fired top officials overseeing ethics, whistleblower protections, and labor rights, including the heads of the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Merit Systems Protection Board. Meanwhile, Justice Department officials are drafting plans to reduce investigations of fraud and public corruption , which means that prosecuting crooked officials will be more difficult. Cuts to the IRS mean that tax fraud will also be harder to identify and prosecute. Just last week, the Justice Department announced that it would curtail investigations of cryptocurrency fraud and disband its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. From the June 2024 issue: The new propaganda war One particular Trump backer has already profited from this new world in which conflicts of interest just don\u2019t matter. Elon Musk, who has no mandate other than the personal blessing of the president, now has enormous influence over the very same government institutions that have long subsidized and regulated his companies. Musk slashed jobs at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal agency that oversees auto safety and crash investigations, including those involving his own electric-vehicle company, Tesla. Musk oversaw mass firings at other regulatory agencies that had launched more than 30 investigations into his companies, which include SpaceX and Neuralink. Kayla Bartkowski / Getty At the same time, major government agencies, including the General Services Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, are using or were considering the use of Starlink , a product of SpaceX. The State Department planned to buy armored Teslas. One Commerce Department official, Evan Feinman, resigned last month because of an administration push to use Starlink to provide rural broadband services. \u201cStranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world\u2019s richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,\u201d he said. Musk isn\u2019t breaking the law, and he doesn\u2019t have to say or do anything to encourage these changes. His new role as America\u2019s premier oligarch means that all kinds of people and agencies will kowtow to him anyway. Musk has also had real influence over American foreign policy. If they are upheld by courts, DOGE\u2019s cuts to USAID, to the U.S. Institute of Peace, and to U.S.-backed foreign broadcasters, including Voice of America, will all deliver deep blows to American diplomacy and soft power, in addition to the damage they will do to international health care and humanitarian aid. The end of American-funded broadcasting by itself will particularly benefit China, which competes with the U.S. in the realm of narratives and ideas as well as economics. It\u2019s curious that Musk was in a position to make these decisions, all so favorable to Chinese soft power, even though he has important ongoing business relationships in China. His \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Shanghai, opened with hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese loans, has become Tesla\u2019s largest production site . But in Trump\u2019s administration, outside interests are no big deal. To take one of many examples, FBI Director Kash Patel, during his Senate hearings, revealed that he has accepted $1 million to $5 million in stock as payment from the corporate parent of Shein, a Chinese e-commerce company that has been accused of using forced labor in its supply chain ; he told senators that he would not divest. Patel has also consulted for the Czechoslovak Group, a foreign arms conglomerate that J. D. Vance, when he was still a senator, said had \u201cties to the inner circle of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d Although Patel, in his new role, will be responsible for countering Russian and Chinese influence and espionage operations, 51 Senate Republicans nevertheless confirmed him. But these are only the conflicts of interest we know about. How many people benefited last week from advance knowledge that Trump would reverse his position on tariffs? How many others are making other stock-market bets based on their access to government information? We don\u2019t know the answers, and Trump\u2019s Department of Justice is unlikely to want to find out. We are living in the dark, just as people do in other kleptocracies, and this changes everything. E arlier this year , I published a book, Autocracy, Inc. , which argues that many modern dictatorships are best analyzed not through the prism of ideology but through the political and financial interests of the people who run them. The presence in the American government of so many people, most notably the president, whose financial interests can be directly and immediately affected by their political decisions means that we now need a different way of analyzing American policy too. To understand Trump\u2019s policies toward Russia and Ukraine, for example, one should ask not merely How will they end the war? and How will they shape America\u2019s relationship to Europe? but Who in Trump\u2019s immediate circle will benefit from the lifting of sanctions? and Have the Russians made explicit financial offers already, and to whom? The rare-minerals deal now being negotiated with Ukraine deserves especially close scrutiny. We need to establish which Americans, exactly, will benefit, and how. The right question to ask about Trump\u2019s tariff policy is also financial: How will this enormous change to American trade policy benefit Trump? One answer is already clear. The countries and large companies damaged by these tariffs, some of which could face huge losses or even bankruptcy, will have an enormous incentive to play up to the president, to offer him political donations, and maybe even to offer business deals to him, his family, or his friends in order to get some kind of exception made for themselves or their industry. In a law-abiding administration, personal finances wouldn\u2019t be an important part of the public debate. But this administration\u2019s leaders have decided that laws and norms of behavior that have held for a century or more don\u2019t apply to them. The Republican-led Congress has so far decided not to enforce them either. It\u2019s now up to the media, to outside organizations, and to whistleblowers to keep reporting the slide into kleptocracy to the public and to the courts, to make sure that remaining laws are enforced. It\u2019s up to the Democratic Party to follow the lead of opposition movements in other kleptocracies and to put corruption at the center of their arguments. Before it\u2019s too late, everyone who can do so must communicate what is happening: American government, American foreign policy, and American trade policy are slowly being transformed, not to benefit Americans but to benefit the president, his family, and his friends. Only voters can stop them.

Musk called Navarro 'moron' and 'dumber than a sack of bricks'. But now, the top White House trade adviser has denied any rift with the tech billionaire and even praised his DOGE work. Agencies Days after the spat, Navarro addressed the public spat with Elon Musk in an interview about the state of the economy and stock market Days after Elon Musk called US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro a \"moron\", the latter reportedly brushed off public humiliation from Tesla CEO. The trade adviser denied Sunday there are tensions between him and President Donald Trump's 'first buddy' and DOGE chief, NBC News reported. In an interview with NBC News, Peter Navarro said \"everything is fine with Elon\". \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse,\" he said with a laugh. Elon Musk, who is seemingly not happy with Trump Tariffs , publicly criticised Navarro last week. It started after responding to a post on him on Twitter, Elon Musk posted, and then deleted, a comment saying Navarro\u2019s PhD from Harvard is a \u201cbad thing,\u201d and that he hasn\u2019t \u201cbuilt sh*t.\u201d ALSO READ: 'Have you ever paid a tariff?': When Trump press secretary had a heated back-and-forth with reporter Elon Musk vs Peter Navarro Earlier this month, a verbal spat broke out between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, calling him a \"moron\" on social media as the SpaceX CEO split from the White House\u2019s tariffs plan. Musk's remarks were in response with Navarro during which the White House trade adviser discussed how Tesla\u2019s position as a \u201ccar assembler\u201d rather than a car manufacturer could be at odds with Trump\u2019s tariff policies. The comments come as Trump had announced widespread tariffs on a swath of countries. \u201cIn many cases, if you go to his Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets, which in the EV case are the batteries, come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan,\u201d Navarro had said. Live Events \u201cThe difference is, in our thinking and Elon\u2019s on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here.\u201d ALSO READ: 'Your presence making Trump, Elon very nervous': At Coachella, Bernie Sanders' big message to crowd In response to this, Musk said Navarro \u201cis truly a moron\u201d in an X post replying to a video of the comments being shared on the social media platform. \u201cWhat he says here is demonstrably false,\u201d he wrote, before calling Navarro \u201cPeter Retarrdo\u201d in another derogatory comment. Musk claimed \u201cTesla has the most American-made cars,\u201d in another series of X posts, adding that \u201cNavarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Peter Navarro denies rift with Elon Days after the spat, Navarro addressed the public spat with Elon Musk in an interview about the state of the economy and stock market. On Sunday, Navarro laughed off reports of tensions between the two men, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker: \u201cElon and I are agreeing. It\u2019s not an issue.\u201d He also praised Musk\u2019s work with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative that has led the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to lay off thousands of workers in the federal government as part of broader stated goal of targeting \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d ALSO READ: 'Most irritating person': Trump officials raise alarm over Elon Musk behaviour amid claims he is 'high' \u201cElon is doing a very good job with his team with waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Navarro said, echoing what he told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a tremendous contribution to America.\u201d Since Trump announced details of his tariffs at the start of April, Musk has broken with the administration, saying last weekend that he\u2019d like to see a \u201czero tariff situation\u201d between the United States and Europe. The White House, for its part, ignored Musk\u2019s comments. \u201cThese are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing.

By Allison Pecorin and Katherine Faulders April 14, 2025, 5:04 AM 7:48 President Donald Trump attends the Ultimate Fighting Championship with Elon Musk, April 12, 2025 in Miami. Nathan Howard/Reuters A new legislative push led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., is seeking to bar special government employees like tech billionaire and senior Trump adviser Elon Musk from communicating with government agencies that interface with their companies, and would require federal employees like Musk to meet new ethics requirements. Warren and Stansbury introduced a bill this week in the Senate and House, respectively, that would prevent special government employees (SGEs) like Musk \u2013 who lead companies worth $1 billion or more \u2013 from interacting with federal agencies that interface with his companies. SpaceX and Tesla together have received billions of dollars in government contracts over the past ten years. While the legislation introduced by Warren and Stansbury does not mention Musk or his companies by name, Musk\u2019s proximity to Trump in the early days of Trump\u2019s second term has made him a clear target of Democrats who have been outspoken about their opposition to Musk\u2019s key role in orchestrating massive cuts to the federal government, with little input from lawmakers. President Donald Trump attends the Ultimate Fighting Championship with Elon Musk, April 12, 2025 in Miami. Nathan Howard/Reuters The bill, titled the SGE Ethics Enforcement & Reform (SEER) Act of 2025, would create what the lawmakers are calling a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d that makes new provisions explicitly applicable to owners of a \u201clarge company,\u201d which the bill defines as any for-profit company making over $1 billion. Democrats, including Warren, have also raised concerns that Musk\u2019s companies could be unfairly benefitting from Musk\u2019s influence over Trump\u2019s policies. Since 2015, Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla have been awarded at least $24 billion in federal contracts , according to government spending data and public announcements. SpaceX has won nearly $23 million worth of contracts, which includes nearly $6 million that the Space Force recently awarded SpaceX for launch missions.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks with ABC News while appearing on 'This Week' April 13, 2025. ABC News The new bill would also implement a new requirement for government employees designated as \u201cspecial government employees\u201d to resolve conflicts of interest between their private-sector and governmental work during their service. Unlike other cabinet and high-level positions that are subject to congressional scrutiny via the Senate confirmation process, Musk, in his advisory role, is designated a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d a status Congress created in 1962 for temporary executive branch hires to perform limited duties for no more than 130 days. \u201cUnelected billionaire Elon Musk should not be acting as co-president of the United States and making $8 million a day from government contracts while he\u2019s at it. My new bill would crack down on conflicts of interest and create stronger ethics rules for Elon Musk and all Special Government Employees. Government should work for the American people, not billionaires lining their own pockets,\u201d Sen. Warren said in a statement provided to ABC News. Those working for the government as special government employees are not paid by the federal government and can continue to collect payment from outside entities while performing their work for the government, which Warren and Stansbury say runs the risk of creating possible conflicts of interest. The legislation aims to address those concerns by applying the same standard ethics rules that apply to regular federal employees to special government employees after they render 60 days of government service. These rules guide federal employees to avoid using their office for personal gain, to steer clear of conflicting financial interest, to maintain impartiality, to avoid outside activity or employment that could raise conflict of interest questions, and more.

Musk has appeared alongside Trump as recently as Thursday, when he was present at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. ABC News has previously reported that Musk could be taking a step back from his current role in the administration. His term would be up around the end of May but it had been widely rumored that the White House could take steps to keep him on or extend his employment status in some way.

I don't need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him,\u201d Trump told reporters during the meeting. Trump has acknowledged that Musk will eventually need to return to Tesla to run the company. However, when reports that Musk could depart the White House in May surfaced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refuted them. Elon Musk attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House, April 10, 2025 in Washington. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images \u201cElon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at [the Department of Government Efficiency] is complete,\" Leavitt said earlier this month. The bill introduced by Warren and Stansbury faces an uncertain future on Capitol Hill. It does not currently have a Republican co-sponsor and it\u2019s unlikely to get the GOP support it would need to move through either chamber of the Republican-controlled Congress. Many Republicans have praised Musk\u2019s efforts to slash federal spending and have remained hesitant to criticize Musk\u2019s work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, the bill comes as Democrats are looking to demonstrate that they are fighting against the Trump agenda on all fronts. Warren has been particularly focused on the Musk-led effort to dismantle federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that she was instrumental in creating.

New advance in artificial intelligence manufacturing could set the stage for robot factories on front lines. Patrick Tucker , Brookings | April 14, 2025 05:06 AM ET Robots Technology China By Patrick Tucker Science & Technology Editor April 14, 2025 05:06 AM ET Robots Technology China A new way to train factory robots could revolutionize how militaries make drones and other weapons, enabling high-volume manufacturing close to front lines. And beyond the battlefield, it shows a possible path forward in the next era of manufacturing, a topic central to the competition between the United States and China, which the National Defense Strategy calls the \u201cpacing challenge.\u201d The paper , published in the January issue of the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, lays out a transformative vision of AI-driven additive manufacturing, or AAM. Today\u2019s factory robots only are capable of a set number of rigid movements, are difficult to adapt to new tasks, and require highly specialized places on production floors. They can\u2019t see when they are lined up incorrectly, or when they make mistakes. The new system\u2014developed by an international team of researchers from California State University, Northridge; the National University of Singapore; NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2014uses highly-skilled engineers to train robots in a much fuller range of human-like movements, enabling them to perceive and (on a basic level) understand what they are doing. When combined with 3D printing technology, the framework opens up the possibility of complete end-to-end manufacturing of electronics, like the small drones re-shaping the battlefield in Ukraine. But it also addresses a key question at the root of the overarching power struggle between the United States and China: how to increase the manufacturing strength of the U.S. Related articles \u2018All hands on deck' moment in the US-China AI race: Pentagon's former digital chief Robot reality check: Crewed warplanes will remain vital for years, USAF general says Before President Donald Trump made re-shoring manufacturing a core focus of his presidency , the Biden White House undertook a series of different policy moves with the same goal\u2014including the use of smaller and more gradual tariffs accompanied by grants and other incentives . The Pentagon has launched several initiatives to reshore production of things like microelectronics, citing China's dominance in those sectors as a strategic liability. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which allocates over $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, reflects bipartisan recognition that industrial capability underpins military and economic strength. Without secure, domestic access to critical technologies, the U.S. risks operational delays, compromised weapons systems, and diminished deterrence capacity in future conflicts. But the United States suffers from a critical lack of skilled workers to meet those goals. And institutes like NIST, as well as industry heads, forecast that even with government investment, building that workforce would take at least seven years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik said this month that robotics and automation could play a key role in a U.S.-led manufacturing renaissance. And several American robotics companies are pushing for a national strategy to promote manufacturing automation. However, the current state of factory robotics lags behind hopes for a quick transition to factory automation. A 2019 report from Boston Consulting Group points out the obvious: manufacturing robots lack the adaptiveness and dexterity of human workers, and robots lack the problem-solving abilities that are still key to actually producing things. That\u2019s changed little since 2019, as revealed by the controversies and embarrassing public demonstrations of the Optimus robot developed by Tesla. Questions about whether Optimus is indeed autonomous or just an elaborate human-controlled puppet point to larger uncertainties about exactly how to make truly humanistic robots. That\u2019s why this new paper is so significant. Traditional manufacturing methods, even robots, \u201cneed a lot of well-trained engineers,\u201d said co-author Bingbing Li of California State University, Northridge. And even the most advanced 3D printers often require manual steps for design input, process selection, or post-processing. The paper\u2019s AAM vision includes end-to-end autonomy: from computer-assisted design model preparation and nesting to scheduling, process optimization, and post-print machining\u2014all managed by a fleet of collaborating robots or drones. This integration will be particularly important for manufacturing in outer space, hence the interest and support from NASA. Li said he\u2019s also been in contact with military contractors and the Defense Department\u2019s office of Operational Testing and Evaluation for a defense-related project that could begin in May, if final approvals are granted. AAM relies heavily on what the authors call sensor-integrated design: the use of many sensors of visible light, heat, and other phenomena to create a sort of perception in a software \u201cbrain.\u201d That brain, which differentiates tomorrow\u2019s factory robots from today\u2019s, will have four layers: a \u201cknowledge layer\u201d at the base of the model collects data from sensors, simulations, and past operations. A \u201cgenerative solution layer\u201d uses AI tools like large language models and knowledge graphs to model decision-making. An \u201coperational layer\u201d implements decisions on hardware, software, and robotic systems; and a \u201ccognitive layer\u201d empowers machines with agency , allowing them to reason, act, and even reflect. \u201cWithin this [cognitive] layer, AI agents act as high-level controllers, assessing the skill pool in the operational layer to select appropriate skills for task execution based on the current state,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThese agents are responsible for planning and executing optimal actions, engaging in a lifelong learning process that enhances their expertise through continuous reflection and learning.\u201d That process of learning is similar to the way humans interact with large language models. At first, the results are generic and error-prone, but over time, the relationship between the trainer and the machine produces a type of human-like intelligence that can be replicated across multiple robots. \u201cWe hope to minimize the human operation down to or close to zero, because the whole process itself, we want to automate,\u201d Li said. The degree to which some manufacturing processes can be automated will depend greatly on the complexity of the thing that is being produced and how quickly AI systems can learn to adapt to new, unexpected events. Li said human experts will still play a crucial role in that process, but more akin to supervisors than operators. Instead of doing the manual tasks beyond a robot\u2019s ken, the human will help the robots develop, improve, and validate ways to deal with the unexpected. Ideally, the AI would become smart enough to actually consider how to improve on human designs, via what the authors call \u201cgenerative design tools,\u201d including diffusion models , 3D reconstruction, and neural radiance fields . NeRFs extrapolate depth and volume from pictures, the same way the brain does, to automate the design and creation of 3D objects from mere sketches or photos. \u201cThese advancements pave the way for 3D content creation, potentially bringing us closer to the realization of \u2018What you think is what you get,\u2019\u201d the authors write\u200b. \u201cBy exploring vast design spaces, these tools generate innovative solutions that traditional methods might overlook.\u201d In a military context, this means a soldier in the field could scan a broken part and an AI-enhanced system could redesign and print a replacement with minimal oversight\u2014a power that could vastly reduce manning and logistics needs at the front. The Defense Department, including DARPA, have increasingly emphasized secure, scalable, and on-demand manufacturing for contested logistics environments. The AAM method of closed-loop manufacturing using multiple sensors, feeding data to a layered intelligence, offering a roadmap for not only smarter production but resilient, adaptive manufacturing capabilities that could redefine the industrial front lines. But beyond bases, the framework shows a path forward for moving manufacturing back to the United States. That has implications for the broader race with China, which wields its industrial capacity not only for economic dominance but to produce vast weapons stockpiles. Then-Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Bill LaPlante noted this challenge in October 2023: \u201cToday, the U.S. is in a technological and economic race to maintain its manufacturing edge, particularly as it concerns critical defense systems, such as satellites, advanced munitions and communications technologies.\u201d But the advancement also highlights other serious challenges standing in the way of a more automated manufacturing future, namely that China is the market-share leader in key components that robots need, such as sensors and actuators. Additionally, China has much more access to the materials that would be required to print and build products\u2014including weapons\u2014in robot-run factories.

Credit: BEYOND EXPO Tesla has de-facto suspended sales and marketing of its imported Model S and Model X electric vehicles in China, which have faced retaliatory 125% import levies imposed by the Chinese government amid an escalating trade war with the US. New orders for the two Tesla flagship models are no longer accepted on its Chinese website by the US automaker, according to a Reuters report. This comes two days after the Trump administration upped the levies on China on top of an existing 20% tariff related to the drug fentanyl. China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024, which accounted for less than 0.3% of Tesla\u2019s total deliveries of 657,102 units in China last year, according to figures revealed by Li Yanwei, an analyst with the China Auto Dealers Association.

That\u2019s not the whole story By Chris Isidore , CNN 7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Mon April 14, 2025 Link Copied! Follow: Auto industry See your latest updates Employees install parts on a door at the Mercedes-Benz factory in Vance, Alabama. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Much of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff rhetoric has been about restoring factory jobs \u2014 particularly auto jobs \u2014 that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cAmerican steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen \u2026 they really suffered gravely,\u201d Trump said during his April 2 rollout of new tariffs. \u201cForeign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.\u201d Trump promises that his 25% tariffs on all imported cars will raise costs enough to bring a flood of new auto plant construction, and thus auto jobs, back to US shores. But the loss of auto jobs in the US, especially across the upper Midwest, is a complex story beyond trade deals and shifting production to low-wage countries. There was also the fact that American car buyers abandoned the three Detroit automakers for foreign competitors following years of questionable quality and value. And most importantly, the introduction of automation, which drastically reduced the hours needed to assemble a car . \u201cWhat you see is that the real story in the auto sector is automation,\u201d said Jason Miller, a business professor at Michigan State University and an auto industry expert. One of the reasons the production shift to Mexico gets so much attention from those angry about assembly plants and auto parts factories closing, Miller says, is due to timing. The introduction of more robots, and the resulting job loss, \u201cwas especially severe during the exact time period that trade liberalization took place.\u201d And the situation is not nearly as dire as Trump makes it out to be. In fact, there are more workers building cars in US assembly plants today than when NAFTA took effect in 1994, according to the US Labor Department data. They also built roughly twice as many cars as Mexico and Canada combined last year, according to S&P Global Mobility. Experts widely agree that the trade deals are a distant third cause of auto factory closings, behind automation and market share losses. Tariffs are not going to reverse those factors. Big Three lose market share Automation revolutionized car manufacturing. It cut the time it took to build a car from about 50 hours of labor in 1988 down to about 18-20 hours by 2005, said Laurie Harbour, partner at auto industry consultant Wipfli, which studies auto plant efficiency. \u201cAt the same time, (the Detroit automakers) were dramatically losing market share,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cSo those two things combined \u2013 I\u2019m not making as many vehicles, and I\u2019m making them in like half the time \u2013 is what led to the plant closings.\u201d Up through the early 1970s, more than 80% of US car sales went to the traditional Big Three American carmakers \u2014 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which is today owned by Stellantis, according to Wards Automotive, which reports on the auto industry. That market dominance started to decline in the face of Japanese imports. By 2007, the Big Three lost a majority of US sales for the first time, and in 2024, they made up only 38% of the US market combined. That loss of market share was greatly self-inflicted, said Patrick Anderson, president of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan think tank. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that deficient quality, uninspired design and bad labor relations of 20 to 30 years ago caused lasting wounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US automakers have recovered from much of that. But before it got there, it did end up bankrupting GM and Chrysler.\u201d And despite building better quality cars in recent years, those American brands haven\u2019t been able to win back many of the buyers it lost to import brands, he said. Foreign brands make many cars here While foreign automakers were winning market share, they were also building their own US plants. But not all auto jobs are made equal. Most of those new plants were nonunion factories built in lower-wage \u201cright-to-work\u201d states in the South. Currently, the only exception is a Chattanooga, Tennessee, Volkswagen plant that voted to join the United Auto Workers union just a year ago. Last year, Asian and European brands built 4.9 million vehicles at US plants, edging out the 4.6 million built by Ford, GM and Stellantis, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Tesla built an additional 648,000 at its two US plants. That is why even with automation and market share losses, there are more US auto plant assembly jobs today as there were 30 years ago. While assembly jobs are slightly above their 1994 levels there has been a decline in auto parts jobs. That\u2019s significant \u2014 nearly twice as many auto workers build parts as perform the final assembly. Many of those parts jobs disappeared due to production shifts to Mexico or automation in American plants. And new US auto parts jobs followed the new assembly plants to nonunion states in the South: Michigan has lost half of its 220,000 auto parts jobs since the 1990s, while auto parts jobs in Alabama have more than doubled, according to Miller, the business professor at Michigan State University. Even so, there is no doubt that NAFTA led to a boom in assembly plants and auto parts factories in Mexico. Today, virtually every major global automaker has a plant in Mexico to serve the US market. Last year, Mexican plants built 4 million vehicles and shipped 2.5 million of them to American customers, according to S&P Global Mobility. An employee transports test parts for a Volkswagen Tiguan inside the company's plant in Puebla, Mexico, on October 13, 2016. Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg/Getty Images Under NAFTA, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump negotiated in his first term to take NAFTA\u2019s place, automakers operated as if the three countries were a single market. They built cars and trucks by moving parts and vehicles freely across the borders. But more cars have also been imported from Asia and Europe. Today, South Korea is the second-largest source of car imports behind Mexico, sending 1.4 million cars to US dealers. Japan is right behind with 1.3 million followed by Canada with 1 million and Germany a distant fifth with 430,000 exports, according to S&P Global Mobility. US auto industry still strong Despite its problems, US auto plants still dominate the North American market and are major players globally, unlike other sectors such as textiles and semiconductors. Last year, 10.2 millions cars \u2014 or two-thirds of the North American output \u2014 were assembled at US plants, according to S&P Global Mobility. That\u2019s enough to account for 55% of the cars purchased in the United States, with 1 million exported to other countries, including Canada and Mexico. US car production is currently down only 14% since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, according to Wards Automotive. That\u2019s even as car production in Mexico has soared 272% since then. Despite the arguments made by the Trump administration, tariffs won\u2019t relocate auto plants in foreign countries to America anytime soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a minimum of a two-year exercise to pull a plant out of Mexico and move it here,\u201d said Harbour. US assembly plants with excess capacity can\u2019t necessarily start producing the additional models now being built elsewhere. And reopening a plant that has been closed can take years. Even if new auto plants are built, they would need to be highly automated to compete with lower-wage Mexican plants. \u201cYou will not see US manufacturing employment numbers go back to the 1990 level due to automation,\u201d said Miller. Even members of the Trump administration are talking about automation in new plants, which would mean fewer jobs in any returning plants than the factories of the past. \u201cHere\u2019s the key. Factories now can use robotics,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a recent interview on CNBC . \u201cSo American workers can be much more efficient with robotics. You\u2019re going to see the greatest surge in \u2026 teaching people how to be robotics mechanics \u2026 it\u2019s a great paying job and it requires a high school education.\u201d It\u2019s more likely that parts plants will shift back to America than assembly plants, said Harbour. But that doesn\u2019t mean there will be significantly more jobs at those factories. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see some job growth. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a jobs boom,\u201d said Harbour. \u201cIt\u2019s being portrayed to be much larger than I think it will be.\u201d Related Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback CNN Business Videos Comedy Central Video Jon Stewart mocks Trump\u2019s \u2018Pinterest vibe\u2019 Oval Office aesthetic 1:30 Apr 15, 2025 Andrew Harnik/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Video Former FTC chair explains how to prove if a company is a monopoly 1:30 Apr 15, 2025 CNN Video \u2018I\u2019m very optimistic\u2019: Steel company owner tells CNN tariffs will help them 3:28 Apr 15, 2025 CNN Video Top economist predicts a recession in weeks if Trump\u2019s trade war continues 1:18 Apr 14, 2025 Ad Feedback Ad Feedback", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/14/business/us-auto-jobs-history-free-trade-automation/index.html", "source": "CNN", "published_at": "2025-04-14T09:00:36"}, {"id": 370, "title": "Unlock YouTube on Apple CarPlay: The No-Jailbreak Method You Need to Know", "content": "Unlock YouTube on Apple CarPlay - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer Have you ever wanted to watch YouTube or access streaming apps like Netflix directly on your car\u2019s infotainment system without modifying its original setup? The solution lies in external devices that unlock advanced features such as YouTube, Netflix, and app access through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto\u2014all without requiring a jailbreak. These devices offer a seamless way to enhance your in-car entertainment system while preserving your vehicle\u2019s original functionality. The video below from HotshotTek explores how these devices work, their features, and why they are a practical choice for upgrading your driving experience. Watch this video on YouTube . Understanding External Devices for In-Car Entertainment External devices designed for in-car entertainment come in two primary categories, each offering unique benefits: Android-based devices: These devices provide full Android functionality, allowing access to apps like YouTube, Netflix, and the Google Play Store directly on your car\u2019s infotainment screen. They essentially transform your car\u2019s system into a smart device. Wireless CarPlay adapters: These adapters are designed to convert wired CarPlay systems into wireless ones. In addition to eliminating the need for cables, they often include features like streaming capabilities and enhanced audio performance. Both types of devices are compatible with vehicles that support wired CarPlay, making them an accessible and cost-effective solution for drivers looking to expand their car\u2019s multimedia capabilities without replacing the head unit. Features and Benefits of External Devices These devices bring a wealth of functionality to your car\u2019s infotainment system, transforming it into a versatile multimedia hub. Key features include: Streaming access: Enjoy popular platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Apple Music directly from your car\u2019s display. App downloads: With Google Play Store support, you can install additional apps to suit your preferences. Connectivity options: Many devices offer built-in LTE connectivity via a SIM card or mobile hotspot, making sure uninterrupted streaming on the go. Cross-platform compatibility: These devices work seamlessly with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay systems, catering to a wide range of users. Mobile gaming support: While console streaming isn\u2019t available, some devices allow for casual gaming, adding another layer of entertainment. Whether you\u2019re embarking on a long road trip or navigating your daily commute, these features can significantly enhance your driving experience by providing entertainment and convenience. Preserving Your OEM System One of the standout advantages of these external devices is their ability to retain your car\u2019s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) system. Unlike aftermarket head units, which can be costly and may disrupt your car\u2019s settings, these devices integrate seamlessly with your existing setup. By keeping the OEM system intact, you benefit from: Preserved car settings: Features like climate controls, ambient lighting, and other factory settings remain unaffected. High-quality displays and audio: OEM systems often offer superior resolution and sound quality compared to aftermarket alternatives. Full compatibility: These devices work harmoniously with your car\u2019s built-in features, making sure a smooth user experience. This makes them particularly appealing for older vehicles, where replacing the head unit might not be practical or cost-effective. By opting for an external device, you can enjoy modern entertainment features without compromising your car\u2019s original design. Considerations and Limitations While these devices offer numerous advantages, it\u2019s important to be aware of their limitations to make an informed decision: Vehicle compatibility: These devices are only compatible with cars that support wired CarPlay, limiting their use in some models. Variable audio quality: The sound performance may differ depending on the specific device you choose, so research is essential. Data usage: Streaming relies on cellular data, which could lead to increased costs if not monitored carefully. Despite these challenges, the benefits of these devices often outweigh the drawbacks, especially for drivers seeking a cost-effective way to upgrade their car\u2019s entertainment system. Who Benefits the Most? These devices are particularly advantageous for specific groups of drivers, including: Owners of older vehicles: Drivers with older models, such as those equipped with Ford Sync 3 or earlier Kia systems, can modernize their infotainment experience without replacing the head unit. Road trip enthusiasts: Long journeys become more enjoyable with access to streaming platforms and other entertainment options. Audio-focused users: Those who prioritize sound quality can benefit from devices designed to enhance audio performance. If you fall into any of these categories, these devices can provide a significant upgrade to your in-car experience, making every drive more enjoyable and engaging. The Future of In-Car Entertainment The landscape of in-car entertainment is evolving rapidly. There is growing speculation that Apple and Google may eventually integrate streaming platforms like YouTube directly into CarPlay and Android Auto. Some automakers, including BMW, Tesla, and Mercedes, have already introduced built-in YouTube functionality in their infotainment systems. However, until these features become standard across all vehicles, external devices remain the most practical and accessible option for enhancing your car\u2019s entertainment capabilities without altering its original design. External devices offer a straightforward and effective way to unlock advanced features like YouTube and streaming apps on your car\u2019s infotainment system. By retaining your OEM setup, they provide a seamless and cost-efficient solution for improving in-car entertainment, particularly for older vehicles. Whether you\u2019re planning a road trip or simply looking to make your daily commute more enjoyable, these devices can transform your driving experience into something far more engaging and convenient.

Our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are critical to our success.\u201d That\u2019s an extract from the obligatory risks section of a recent annual report from Block, the fintech firm founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Who has sparked a big debate this weekend by tweeting \u201cdelete all IP law\u201d on X . \u201cI agree,\u201d replied X owner Elon Musk . The most recent annual report from one of his other companies, Tesla, notes that it seeks \u201cto protect the underlying intellectual property rights\u201d of its technology innovations and designs through patents, trademarks, copyrights and other measures. Unlike another Musk venture, SpaceX \u2013 202 patents at the time of writing since you ask \u2013 it isn\u2019t rocket science to point quizzically at tech moguls calling for the system of IP protections that helped them make their billions to be thrown in the bin. But still, it\u2019s a bit on the nose. Dorsey\u2019s response to a number of replies to his tweet suggests that his view is partly because he thinks that \u201cexecution and speed matters more\u201d; partly about the approach in China (\u201cdo you want to have a chance at competing with them?\u201d; and partly a distrust of rightsholders. \u201cCreativity is what currently separates us, and the current system is limiting that, and putting the payments disbursement into the hands of gatekeepers who aren\u2019t paying out fairly,\u201d went one reply on the latter point. We\u2019d normally say \u2018well, this\u2019ll be awkward the next time Block subsidiary Tidal is negotiating licensing deals with music rightsholders, who have some quite different views on IP law eh?\u2019 at this point. But Dorsey and his company\u2019s interest in the music-streaming business seems to have dwindled away already . The serious point: this is a snapshot of an ever-louder public discussion, where some (not all) powerful people in the tech industry want to frame copyright as a barrier to innovation and growth. It\u2019s at the heart of consultations on how AI training should be regulated, for example. Music rightsholders certainly don\u2019t have a spotless record when it comes to fair payouts, but sweeping away copyright protection would benefit musicians far less than it would benefit, well, tech moguls. But the challenge for the music industry is to push back on the zero-sum analysis that copyright and IP laws can\u2019t co-exist with innovation. In fact, they should drive it. Dorsey is clearly thinking about technological innovation: he doesn\u2019t seem to care much about innovation in art and culture. But a world where IP laws are deleted en masse feels a bleak prospect for both.

[Mike Blake/Reuters] By Amy Sherman | PolitiFact Published On 14 Apr 2025 14 Apr 2025 United States President Donald Trump and his allies have offered a solution to avoiding price hikes because of his car tariffs : buy American. Trump told NBC News on March 29 that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if foreign car manufacturers raised prices in response to tariffs. \u201cI hope they raise their prices because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have plenty.\u201d The administration\u2019s 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect on April 3, and an additional tariff on imported auto parts is set to take effect on May 3. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their costs are often passed down to consumers through higher prices. Fox News host Jesse Watters made a similar statement to Trump on April 3: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried cars are going to cost more, buy American.\u201d Watters cited a clip of Ford Motor Co\u2019s promotion to temporarily give customers its employee rate on cars. Bernie Moreno, a Republican senator from Ohio who owned multiple car dealerships before taking office, echoed Trump in an April 2 CNN interview. Advertisement Moreno said the \u201conly ones that are mostly hurt are the cars that are made overseas, exclusively, and are shipped into the United States. The ultra-luxury cars.\u201d However, this is contradicted by an analysis by Cox Automotive, a research firm, which found that the \u201c25 percent tariff on imported vehicles will apply to nearly 80 percent of vehicles priced under $30,000\u201d. The analysis cited models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Trax and Trailblazer, Nissan Sentra and Honda HR-V. Senator Moreno added that among \u201cmainstream cars \u2013 a Honda, a Toyota, a Subaru, a Ford, a Chevy \u2013 if one car goes up in price, because there\u2019s a tariff, that person will just buy the other one that doesn\u2019t have a tariff, which is your American-made automobile\u201d. Many car experts said it is not so simple to avoid price increases by buying US cars, because those assembled in the US also use imported parts. \u201cThe concept of an American-made car with all parts from the US is a fictional tale,\u201d said Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey will tariff those parts.\u201d Car companies rely on imported parts to varying degrees. For example, the Tesla Model Y has 70 percent of the value of its parts made in the US or Canada. For the Ford F-150, it is 45 percent. The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists have said it is unlikely that high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans. Advertisement In response to a PolitiFact email asking about Moreno\u2019s statement on US-made cars, a spokesperson for the senator attacked the publication and provided no answers to its questions about cars and tariffs. The White House, when contacted, said that some auto parts are exempted from tariffs. Many US car manufacturers use imported parts Moreno said that US-assembled cars that get parts from Mexico and Canada will be \u201ccompletely tariff-free\u201d if they comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump\u2019s administration negotiated in 2018. But many auto parts used in the US come from countries other than Mexico and Canada. Jason Miller, a Michigan State University supply chain management professor, examined auto tariff data and told PolitiFact that it showed Mexico \u201cclearly top of the list\u201d for car parts imported into the US. China is second (because of lithium-ion batteries), Japan is fourth, South Korea is fifth and Germany is sixth. Miller said Trump\u2019s other tariffs on steel and aluminium mean that even if a car were 100 percent assembled from only domestic components, costs would still rise because steel and aluminium prices are increasing in the US. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t oversimplifying things, they are outright lying,\u201d Miller said about people saying car shoppers can buy all US-made cars. Also, not all auto parts from Mexico comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, so those are being tariffed, too, he said. Amy R Broglin-Peterson, a Michigan State University expert on supply chain management, said, \u201cAll vehicles use at least some percentage of foreign parts \u2013 period. There is no vehicle model that uses 100 percent American-manufactured parts.\u201d Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported on April 4 that, at first glance, Ford is best positioned to weather tariffs because 80 percent of its cars, pick-up trucks and SUVs sold in the US are manufactured domestically, and so are many of the parts. Many components of Ford\u2019s F-150s, such as alternators and wheels, come from other countries and, starting in May, those parts could face a new 25 percent tax. The Wall Street Journal wrote, \u201cSo even though Ford\u2019s trucks are built in the American heartland, import tariffs could jack up the average price by thousands of dollars\u201d. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) publishes data about the US and Canadian content by value of the parts used to assemble passenger motor vehicles in the US and foreign countries. The data shows that some Toyota car lines built in the US, such as Corolla, include at least 25 percent value of parts imported from Japan. A Toyota spokesperson said that 47 percent of vehicles the company sold in the US in 2024 were built in the US. USA Today analysed NHTSA data for multiple automakers and found that \u201cfor all models assembled and available for sale in the US, 47 percent of the parts (by value) originated from the US or Canada\u201d. A Cox Automotive spokesperson said that the average US-made vehicle has about 50 percent of its parts or components by value imported. Car prices could rise because of Trump\u2019s tariffs The long-term effect of the tariffs on the car industry us difficult to predict. Cox Automotive predicted strong sales until the pre-tariff inventory declines. Advertisement \u201cBut all roads lead to this fact: In the coming months and years, as new tariffs settle into place, vehicle prices in the US are expected to increase,\u201d Cox wrote in an April 4 market insights report. Cox predicted that vehicles affected by these tariffs could see prices increase by 10 percent to 15 percent, and at least a 5 percent increase for vehicles not subject to the full tariff. \u201cProduction disruptions and declines could be a reality this summer, especially as automakers and suppliers work to align practices with the new rules,\u201d Cox wrote. As the price of cars manufactured in foreign countries rises, producers of competing US models with fewer imported parts will raise their prices, not dollar for dollar, but perhaps 40 cents per dollar, Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted. \u201cUS auto manufacturers are hurting, and they will raise prices where they can,\u201d Hufbauer said.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

(Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Getty Images Trefis Tesla stock appears relatively expensive , making it a costly option at its current price of around $250. The company faces several risks. The U.S.\u2019s imposition of tariffs on all imports threatens to trigger a recession, while growing tensions between the U.S. and China, along with potential brand damage due to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s political involvement, could further impact Tesla. The stock remains nearly 47% below its December 2024 peak, and more downside could follow, as Tesla has historically underperformed the broader market in downturns. For instance, during the 2022 inflation shock, Tesla stock plunged 73.6% compared to a 25.4% drop in the S&P 500. This suggests further downside is possible. Separately, want exposure to AI? Should you Buy MSFT Stock At $400? Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries have declined, with the company reporting 336,681 deliveries in Q1 2025, down 13% year-over-year. The situation could deteriorate further. The U.S.-China trade war is intensifying, with President Trump raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, while China responded with an 84% duty on American imports. Although Tesla manufactures in China at its Shanghai plant, potential anti-American sentiment and Elon Musk\u2019s perceived alignment with Trump may affect sales. China accounted for 21% of Tesla\u2019s revenue in the past year. The Shanghai facility, with a capacity of over 950,000 vehicles annually, produced over half of Tesla\u2019s 2024 shipments. Reduced sales and underutilization may squeeze margins, especially as competition from Chinese automakers surges with high-tech, competitively priced vehicles. The U.S. market outlook is more mixed. Tesla may benefit from its upcoming Robotaxi launch in Austin and a refreshed Model Y. However, Elon Musk\u2019s political involvement, particularly his role in the Trump administration, is alienating progressive consumers. While the new tariffs give Tesla a cost edge over competitors reliant on Mexican production, Tesla also sources many components from China and Mexico, potentially increasing its own costs. In Europe, the situation is grim. Tesla's Q1 market share in 15 European countries dropped to 9.3% from 17.9% a year ago, following Musk\u2019s support of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party during February elections. Fundamentally, Tesla\u2019s metrics don't justify its high valuation. Despite strong operating performance and financial stability, as outlined below, investors seeking lower volatility might consider the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio , which has outpaced the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception.

In the US-China trade war, Beijing needs to stay ahead of the competition. This surprising move threatens to disrupt international manufacturing and security operations as countries scramble to find alternative suppliers. Rare Earths: The Backbone of Modern Technology US-China Trade War: Beijing Halts Rare Earth Exports, Affecting Global According to The New York Times , China dominates the global rare earth market, producing nearly 90% of the world's supply of these 17 essential elements. Rare earths are critical to the development of electric vehicles, smartphones, renewable energy technologies, advanced robotics, and military hardware such as missiles and drones. Among the rare earths now restricted are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium-related compounds. These elements are particularly hard to source and refine, making China's export halt a direct threat to global production capabilities. Export Crackdown Hits US and Allied Industries The new export controls come in response to a sharp tariff hike imposed by former US President Donald Trump, which took effect on April 2. In retaliation, Beijing introduced sweeping export restrictions on key minerals, magnets, and advanced materials. The measures target both raw materials and finished products, making it even harder for companies to find quick replacements. Many Chinese ports have already halted shipments of these materials, as Beijing crafts a long-term regulatory framework. Once finalized, this new system could permanently block exports to certain foreign companies, including US military contractors and tech manufacturers. Supply Chain Disruption Looms for Auto and Semiconductor Giants From Tesla to Boeing, and from chipmakers to renewable energy developers, a wide array of industries could feel the pressure. Permanent magnets, in particular, are indispensable for electric vehicle motors, aircraft systems, and industrial automation. Analysts warn that the US and other Western nations lack sufficient domestic production to meet demand. America currently operates just one rare earth mine, with most of its supply still dependent on Chinese exports. DigiTimes reported that the rare earth export controls also threatened semiconductor manufacturers in South Korea . Originally published on Tech Times \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The Tesla CEO has spearheaded efforts to reduce the deficit by at least $1 trillion, held private meetings on Capitol Hill, and even attended cabinet meetings. However, Musk's growing influence in Washington may become a central factor in a Democratic resurgence in the 2026 midterms. In recent weeks, Musk's approval ratings have plummeted. A recent poll conducted by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies and Harris, which surveyed 2,746 registered voters between March 26 and 27, found that 49 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, compared to just 39 percent who view him favorably. This is a sharp decline from February, when 44 percent said they viewed Musk favorably, and an equal percentage viewed him unfavorably. Similarly, a YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between April 5-8 among 1,563 registered voters, showed a drop in Musk's favorability from 44 percent in January to 40 percent. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters view him unfavorably, an increase from 48 percent in January. Pollster Nate Silver 's tracker also shows Musk's approval rating deep underwater, with 54 percent of Americans viewing him unfavorably and 40 percent viewing him favorably.

Since joining the Trump administration, Musk has aggressively pushed for policies aimed at slashing government spending, rolling back regulations, and downsizing the federal workforce, all in his role as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These efforts have triggered a series of legal challenges and widespread public backlash. Just last week, thousands gathered in a series of global \"Hands Off!\" protests, expressing outrage over Musk's attempts to gut federal agencies and cut the federal workforce. Hundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations have also taken place, urging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and shares of the company's stock in protest of Musk. In March, its market value fell by 4 percent. Musk's political clout was also shaken this month by the defeat of Brad Schimel, the Trump-backed judicial candidate, who lost to Susan Crawford by a 9-point margin in Wisconsin, despite Musk pouring millions of dollars into backing the Republican candidate. Since then, political analysts and GOP strategists have pointed to Musk's increasingly polarizing image as a key factor in the loss.

Alishia Abodunde/Getty Images \"It was clear that his efforts to take a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are deeply unpopular with the majority of voters,\" Democratic strategist Doug Gordon told Newsweek . In response, a group of 77 House Democrats, led by Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Greg Casar, is launching a campaign to force Musk to resign from his position at DOGE by May 30, saying it is \"for the good of the country.\" Amid Musk's declining popularity, Democrats are starting to see a path to recovery in the 2026 midterms after the party faced a humiliating defeat in the 2024 election, with Trump improving his vote share in almost every state, and the Republicans taking the House and the Senate . Pollster Adam Carlson suggested that Democrats could adopt a strategy similar to the one Republicans used in 2010, when they targeted then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , whose low favorability ratings made her a more effective target than President Barack Obama , who was still relatively popular. Carlson argued that Musk, much like Pelosi at the time, could become a potent symbol for Democratic opposition, particularly if his favorability continues to decline while Trump's approval remains stable due to the loyalty of his base. However, recent polls have shown Trump's approval rating declining as well. \"Musk could serve as a powerful 'bonus bogeyman' for Democrats, particularly in tight races across the House, Senate, and state-level contests,\" Carlson said. \"As we saw in Wisconsin last week, Musk is so electorally toxic that just the idea of him might be enough.\" Carlson also noted that while Democrats should focus their attacks on Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms, \"having that bonus bogeyman who is loathed by swing voters could be pivotal in key House, Senate, governor, and downballot races.\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, agreed, telling Newsweek : \"Elon Musk will certainly have a political target on his back in the 2026 midterms. The fact that DOGE is waning in popularity, and many voters resent Musk trying to buy elections with his wealth, will serve as energizers for the Democratic base.\" \"Musk does offer the Democrats an advantage in campaigning in that he is increasingly unpopular and his wealth is very otherworldly to most Americans,\" G. Elliott Morris, former director of 538 for ABC News, said. Democratic strategist Christy Setzer pointed to recent protests and strong special election results as signs of rising Democratic momentum. Setzer sees Musk as a powerful symbol for Democrats to rally against, particularly if they tie him directly to Trump, framing both as a unified threat. \"There's a clear and obvious upside in going after Musk\u2014just ask the Wisconsin electorate, who showed him the door in dramatic fashion just last week,\" Setzer said. Indeed, in Wisconsin's recent Supreme Court election, the Democrats framed their victory as a repudiation of Musk. Following their success, DNC Chair Ken Martin issued a statement criticizing both Trump and Musk for undermining key social programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, all in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. He also blamed their economic policies\u2014especially the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u2014for eroding consumer confidence and fueling fears of a recession. On a recent episode of the Hacks On Tap podcast, former Obama-era adviser David Axelrod characterized the recent Wisconsin election as \"a referendum on Elon Musk,\" not Trump. \"Democrats see it as more fruitful to go after Musk,\" Axelrod explained.

Scott Olson/Getty Images However, Gift warned that while Musk and DOGE's declining popularity could energize the Democratic base, the party still needs a compelling, positive agenda to make significant inroads. \"Democrats still need a positive message about what they stand for. Like in November's election, simply running against Trump or against Musk won't be enough for Democrats to make the kind of gains in the House and Senate they hope for in 2026.\" Morris echoed this caution, noting that it is unlikely to repair the party's credibility on key issues such as crime, inflation, and trade, where voters still express skepticism. \"I do not think the backlash to him alone will be enough to repair the party's credibility where it was before [Joe] Biden took office,\" Morris told Newsweek . \"Americans tell pollsters they do not trust Democrats to handle crime, the economy, inflation, guns, trade, etc. Just fighting against Musk will not fix all of those problems for them.\" In order to retake the House and the Senate in the 2026 midterms, the Democrats face an uphill battle. Since Trump won against his opponent Kamala Harris , the Democratic Party has seen record-low approval ratings. According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990. There was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Some recent polls have also shown that Trump's approval rating among Democrats is actually rising, indicating that some voters may be less hostile to him than in the past. In a recent interview on Real Time with Bill Mahe r, California Governor Gavin Newsom described his party's brand as \"toxic.\" \"Democrats, we tend to be a little more judgmental than we should be,\" Newsom added. \"We need to own our mistakes. We need to own what's wrong with our party.\" But Setzer argued that her party's popularity has declined because it has been weak in the face of Trump\u2014something that has frustrated voters. \"Democrats aren't standing up strongly against the biggest threat to our economy and our democracy in history,\" she told Newsweek . Looking ahead to the 2026 midterms, Setzer argues that if Democrats want to use the unpopularity of figures like Musk as part of their campaign, they must connect that negative image directly to Trump. By doing so, they can use the public's dislike of Musk to also weaken the president's support. Setzer believes this strategy\u2014attacking both at the same time\u2014can help diminish Trump's power and mobilize voters against him. \"Democrats, r anyone who wishes to stop Trump, need to make sure they're tying Musk's toxicity to Trump and taking him down in the process,\" Setzer said. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

By Reuters | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:19 IST Photo Credit: Reuters Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015 Highlights Musk sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman last year He accused OpenAI of straying from its founding mission OpenAI was founded to develop AI for the good for humanity Advertisement A dozen former OpenAI employees filed a legal brief on Friday backing co-founder Elon Musk's lawsuit aimed at keeping the non-profit status of OpenAI, marking the latest development in the dispute over the future of the artificial intelligence firm. Corporate leaders want to give investors control, drawing a host of concerns and a lawsuit from Musk and others who say business interests must be subordinated to humanitarian goals. Last year, Musk , who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman , accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission - to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations. ChatGPT Can Now Remember and Reference Your Previous Conversations In their federal court filing on Friday, the former employees contended that stripping the nonprofit of its controlling role would \"fundamentally violate\" its mission, as it would lose oversight of the for-profit AI development entity. The former OpenAI employees, who said they held technical and leadership roles in the company, said the nonprofit's oversight was crucial to its overall strategy, and that while they worked at the firm, OpenAI executives had emphasised repeatedly the structure's importance in OpenAI's ability to execute on its mission. The structure also helped with recruitment, and many employees joined because they were inspired by the nonprofit's mission, they said. OpenAI has argued that it needs to remove the nonprofit's controlling role in order to raise funds from investors. The nonprofit will retain a stake in OpenAI that will become increasingly valuable as the company grows, enriching the nonprofit with deep resources to carry out its mission, the company argues. OpenAI Could Buy Jony Ive and Sam Altman\u2019s AI Devices Startup In a statement, OpenAI said the transition would not affect its mission: \u201cOur Board has been very clear: our nonprofit isn't going anywhere and our mission will remain the same.\u201d Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Musk's opposition to the change in structure led to the current suit, and the two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. Recently Musk also went on to create his own AI firm, xAI , in 2023, and Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor. OpenAI, meanwhile, faces pressure from investors to change its structure. In order for OpenAI to secure a $40 billion (roughly Rs. 3,44,386 crore) fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

(AFP via Getty Images, left, and AP file images) By Douglas Schoen PUBLISHED: April 14, 2025 at 3:17 AM EDT The very public \u2013 and often sophomoric\u2013 fights emerging within President Trump\u2019s inner circle have exposed the many different factions desperately competing for Trump\u2019s ear. The two spats \u2013 one between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro and the other between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2013 burst into the public\u2019s view this week as chaos over Trump\u2019s trade policy unnerved markets and business leaders. Ultimately, these fights have immense consequences for the future of Trump\u2019s term. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attempted to brush the issue aside, saying, \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d but the emerging fissures go deeper than mere disagreements over tariff policies. They are symbolic of a proxy war between the longtime MAGA loyalists and the more recent, often more practical \u2013 or less extreme \u2013 supporters. The former are represented by committed ideologues like Navarro, Lutnick and Steve Bannon, who have long pushed Trump to adopt more hardline policies. At the same time, the latter, represented by Musk and other tech and finance titans like Bill Ackman are less idealistic, having backed Trump hoping he would usher in economic prosperity and take a more centrist, common-sense approach to social and cultural issues. Of the two conflicts, the one between Musk and Navarro has been the most public, largely taking place on Musk\u2019s X platform. After Musk took to X to push back against heavy-handed tariffs, Navarro went on CNBC and derided Musk\u2019s Tesla as a simple \u201ccar assembler\u201d rather than an actual \u201ccar manufacturer.\u201d Navarro then insinuated that Tesla\u2019s manufacturing process undermines Trump\u2019s preference for American-made cars, clearly striking a nerve with the world\u2019s richest man and most visible Trump supporter. Musk responded by saying Navarro is \u201ctruly a moron,\u201d accused him of spreading false information, referred to Navarro as \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Plainly, opinions of Musk aside, his position on trade and tariffs is the correct one. Where he believes in truly free trade and understands the benefits of increased global trade, Navarro has been the administration\u2019s loudest champion of protectionist tariffs that would strangle American businesses, bring global trade to a halt, and likely cause a recession. Put another way, Trump would be wise to pay greater attention to the segment of Trump\u2019s coalition that Musk represents \u2013 practical, libertarian, and committed to American dominance of the future industries that will shape the global economy \u2013 than the more extreme, isolationist wing led by Navarro. The other fight within the administration, between Bessent and Lutnick, has not been nearly as public, but it may be even more important for the American economy. Indeed, Bessent has reportedly been advising Trump that tariffs must be a negotiating tactic, rather than a permanent policy, including flying to Florida to push the president to soften his tone. According to Politico , Bessent \u201ctold Trump that markets would remain in peril unless he started putting more emphasis\u201d on the endgame of tariffs \u2013 new trade deals \u2013 and stopped talk of the \u201cpain\u201d Americans would have to endure in a protracted trade war. Bessent\u2019s approach is in direct conflict with Lutnick, who has made regular media appearances stressing that high tariffs are permanent, including telling CNN , Trump is \u201cnot going to back off on tariffs.\u201d Lutnick\u2019s tenure has been marked by these sorts of gaffes. During a CNBC interview on Wednesday, he credited Trump\u2019s policies for the historic surge in the stock market, seemingly oblivious that it was entirely due to Trump doing the very thing Lutnick pledged he wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 backing off on tariffs. On the trade issue, it appears that the Bessent-Musk wing won out, for now at least. The 90-day pause Trump announced on Wednesday may not be a guarantee of no future trade war, but it does give time to negotiate the kind of deals Bessent has advocated for, while suspending the suffocating tariffs pushed by Navarro. Undoubtedly, that policy is the correct one. Had the initial tariffs remained in force for months, the U.S. almost inevitably would have entered a recession. To be sure, these divisions are not new. They have been simmering since even before the inauguration. Last December, the cracks in Trump\u2019s coalition first emerged over the issue of H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. Musk was again leading one side, arguing that these workers allowed American tech companies to maintain their global advantage. The other side, led by Bannon and Laura Loomer, fiercely pushed back, claiming that these migrants \u2013 mostly from India \u2013 were taking jobs away from Americans. Trump eventually came down on Musk\u2019s side, ending that fight, but not the overarching issue of courting a coalition with wildly different \u2013 and often contradictory \u2013 views. For example, Loomer is now apparently back in Trump\u2019s good graces, reportedly being behind the firing of multiple national security officials for supposed \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to the president. Nobody should be under any illusion that the infighting will stop anytime soon. It is a feature of Trump administrations, not an anomaly. Perhaps more than any other president, Trump thrives on playing off his advisor\u2019s diverging views. However, it is clear that if Trump wants to have a successful second term, help Republicans maintain both chambers of Congress, and safeguard his own political legacy, he should lean on the more reserved, professional, and less ideological wing of his coalition. Allowing the extreme, MAGA-loyalists to drive the administration\u2019s policies not only risks wrecking the American economy, but on a wider scale, it risks undermining the Republican Party for years to come.

Supplied The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in use in Cambodia is expected to rise significantly by the end of this year, with a BYD assembly plant scheduled to begin turning out new vehicles in late 2025. During an April 10 meeting between the leadership of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) and a delegation from BYD Auto Industry Co., Ltd., Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the CDC, expressed his appreciation to BYD\u2019s leadership for choosing Cambodia as the location for another assembly plant in the Southeast Asian region. The BYD delegation was led by Xiao Haiping, executive director of the BYD Group President\u2019s Office, who confirmed that the plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of next year. Chanthol explained that, as the Royal Government\u2019s one-stop service body, the CDC is always ready to facilitate and coordinate all private sector investment activities in Cambodia to ensure a favourable, flexible and beneficial investment climate. He also noted that the trend of using BYD cars in Cambodia is on the rise. \u201cOnce the electric vehicle assembly plant is completed and officially begins operations in the fourth quarter of 2025, the usage rate of BYD vehicles in Cambodia is expected to increase even further,\u201d he added. According to BYD executives, a groundbreaking ceremony for the assembly plant is scheduled for the end of April. The BYD assembly plant will be located in the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, which offers convenient transportation access for various components. The plant will involve an investment of over $30 million and is expected to have a production capacity of 10,000 vehicles per year. Recently, BYD also introduced new vehicle models into the Cambodian market, such as the BYD SEALION 5 and BYD ATTO 2, which it described as \u201cnot only high quality and equipped with advanced technology, but also highly fuel-efficient and affordably priced for the Cambodian market\u201d. In June 2024, Prime Minister Hun Manet declared BYD\u2019s establishment of an assembly plant in Cambodia as a major success for the Royal Government\u2019s efforts to attract international investors to the Kingdom. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport recently reported that the number of registered EVs in Cambodia has increased significantly. In 2024, a total of 2,253 EVs were registered \u2014 a 620% increase over 2023, when only 313 new EVs were registered. The report showed that the most popular EV brands in Cambodia are BYD, Toyota and Tesla. Currently, there are six car assembly plants operating in Cambodia, including those for Ford, SsangYong, Hyundai, Kia, GTV and Toyota. latest news Economist: No need for concern over Cambodia\u2019s 90% Chinese trade deficit Drug awareness campaign stepped up during New Year festivities BYD assembly plant to begin Cambodian operations by end of year Fire destroys two motorboats in Kampot province Marigolds bloom for New Year at Tbong Khmum provincial festival Wing Bank Eliminates Cash-Out Fees, Forgoes Millions to Advance Financial Inclusion Rubber exports down as domestic demand increases Gasoline, diesel prices drop by 150 riel Cambodia\u2019s international Q1 trade surged 15% year-on-year Record-setting bridge opens to public for KNY Must Watch More Videos \u276f Shots fired!

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Balmer meticulously planned the assault, using Molotov cocktails and a hammer, intending harm. The attack caused severe damage to the historic residence, symbolizing the erosion of democratic norms. Bipartisan backlash condemned the violence, though media double standards on political violence persist. The incident highlights a broader crisis where extremism replaces democratic discourse with brute force. In the predawn hours of April 13, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, his wife Lori, their four children, and guests were jolted awake by state troopers banging on their door. An arsonist had just firebombed their Harrisburg residence, hurling homemade explosives through shattered windows in what authorities called a \"targeted\" act of terrorism. The suspect, Cody Balmer, 38\u2014who later admitted to \"harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro\u2014turned himself in after confessing he would have assaulted the governor with a hammer if confronted. This brazen attack underscores a chilling trend: the erosion of democratic norms as political violence becomes alarmingly routine in America. A premeditated assault on democracy Balmer\u2019s meticulously planned attack reads like a domestic terrorism manual. According to Pennsylvania State Police affidavits, he siphoned gasoline from a lawnmower, filled Heineken bottles to create Molotov cocktails, and walked an hour to the governor\u2019s mansion. Surveillance footage captured him scaling a perimeter fence, smashing windows with a hammer, and igniting fires in the piano and dining rooms\u2014spaces where Shapiro\u2019s family had hosted a Passover Seder hours earlier. \"He was very methodical in his approach,\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens. Balmer\u2019s admission that he anticipated harming occupants reveals intent beyond property damage; this was an attempted political assassination. The damage was severe : ceilings collapsed, furniture was reduced to ash, and Passover decorations lay blackened beside shattered glass. Yet the greater devastation is symbolic. The governor\u2019s residence\u2014a historic building housing state art and eight gubernatorial families since 1968\u2014was violated not by a random criminal, but by a man weaponizing ideological rage. The backlash was swift and cross-partisan. Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman called the attack \"unacceptable,\" emphasizing, \"There is no place for violence in our society.\" Shapiro, a Democrat, echoed this: \"I don\u2019t give a damn if it\u2019s coming from one particular side or the other \u2026 It has to stop.\" Such solidarity is critical, yet it raises uncomfortable questions. Would national media devote equal coverage if a Republican governor were targeted? Recent history suggests not. When a left-wing activist shot GOP Congressman Steve Scalise in 2017 or when Trump supporters faced violent riots in 2020, many outlets downplayed the ideological motives. This double standard fuels division. As Shapiro noted, violent rhetoric\u2014whether from fringe online forums or mainstream commentators\u2014creates a permission structure for extremists. Balmer\u2019s actions didn\u2019t emerge in a vacuum. They reflect a culture where dehumanizing political opponents has become routine. The broader crisis: Violence as political language The Shapiro attack joins a grim roster: with the 2017 shooting of Rep. Scalise joined by last year\u2019s assassination attempts against Donald Trump and the ongoing burning and firebombing of Tesla vehicles. The common thread? A rejection of democratic resolution in favor of brute force. Balmer\u2019s use of improvised explosives mirrors tactics seen in extremist playbooks, yet his profile\u2014a Harrisburg local with prior theft charges\u2014defies easy categorization. This unpredictability makes such threats harder to combat. Critically, Balmer\u2019s hatred wasn\u2019t abstract. He told police he knew Shapiro might be home, accepting the risk of casualties. This distinguishes the act from mere vandalism; it was terrorism designed to intimidate a sitting official and his constituents. Authorities charged Balmer with eight felonies, including terrorism and attempted murder. Yet legal consequences alone won\u2019t remedy the societal sickness enabling such violence. Shapiro\u2019s refusal to be \"deterred\" is commendable, but his call for unity must be matched by systemic action: bolstering security for officials, de-escalating incendiary rhetoric, and rejecting partisan hypocrisy in condemning attacks. The fire at the governor\u2019s mansion is a flare illuminating America\u2019s crisis of civility. When ideology justifies arson against elected leaders, democracy itself burns. As Shapiro said amidst the ashes: \"We have to be better than this.\" Sources for this article include: 100PercentFedUp.com Fox43.com CNN.com FoxNews.com Related Topics antifa arson bias chaos Dangerous domestic terrorism insanity Josh Shapiro left cult political violence rioting Latest News 04/14/2025 / By Willow Tohi DOJ launches Second Amendment Task Force amid federal rollback of gun control measures 04/14/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Housing market panic escalates: A perfect storm of tariff fears, inflation, high interest rates, and historic unaffordability 04/14/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Father speaks out: Challenging the mainstream narrative of his daughter\u2019s \u201cunvaccinated measles death\u201d 04/14/2025 / By Willow Tohi Convenience culture\u2019s hidden toll: Study links ultra-processed foods to reduced lifespan and environmental harm 04/14/2025 / By Laura Harris Trump administration proposes $998 daily fines on migrants defying deportation orders 04/14/2025 / By Ava Grace RFK Jr. launches federal probe into autism surge, vows answers by 2025 Related News 03/24/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Bernie Sanders, \u201canti-oligarchy rally\u201d exposed as staged spectacle with bussed-in activists tied to antifa, pro-hamas networks 03/24/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Tesla, Elon Musk targeted by same useful idiot domestic terrorists that burned and pillaged American cities in 2020 03/23/2025 / By Willow Tohi EXPOSED: Antifa and IRS collude to shield radical funding from taxation 03/10/2025 / By S.D.

His top baby gear picks so far are Cradlewise's crib and lots of burp cloths. At $1,999, Cradlewise is pricer than the Snoo \u2014 but it can be used for longer. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, is deep in new-dad life \u2014 and he's already sharing strong opinions on baby gear. \"We bought a lot of silly baby things that we haven't needed,\" he posted on X on Sunday night. \"But definitely I recommend a Cradlewise crib and a lot more burp rags than you think you could possibly need.\" Cradlewise hasn't made as many headlines as its older and bigger competitor, the Snoo \u2014 the sleek, motorized bassinet that's basically the Tesla of baby tech . The Snoo , designed by celebrity pediatrician Harvey Karp, has been the go-to setup for sleep-deprived parents for nearly a decade. It uses motion, white noise, and a built-in swaddle to gently rock babies back to sleep. Retailing at $1,695, or $159 a month to rent, the Snoo has amassed a devoted fan base, including celebrity parents like Justin Timberlake and Zoe Salda\u00f1a , who invested in the company. Altman's pick, Cradlewise, works a little differently \u2014 and at nearly $2,000, it's the pricier option. Instead of waiting for cries, it bounces the baby gently up and down to preempt fussing. It also skips the built-in swaddle, one of Snoo's signature features, and includes a built-in baby monitor and music features. Parents can use Cradlewise's crib for longer with a growing baby. The Snoo tops out at around six months old. Cradlewise converts from bassinet to crib, so it can be used until the baby turns two years old or meets other milestones, like weight. \"We're so grateful to Sam Altman for choosing Cradlewise for their baby,\" Radhika Patil, the CEO and cofounder of Cradlewise, told Business Insider. \"It means a lot coming from someone who truly understands the power of good tech.\" Snoo did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. 'Having a kid changed a lot of things' Altman and his husband, software engineer Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their baby boy in February . The newborn came early and spent some time in the neonatal intensive care unit.

It still feels a little paranoid to say it out loud: that the United States might be drifting toward something that looks a lot like Russia. Or Hungary. Or some unholy blend of theocratic nostalgia and corporate feudalism. But that gut feeling\u2014the one that says something\u2019s not right\u2014is getting harder to shake. The signs aren\u2019t exactly subtle, either. To anyone paying attention, they\u2019re plenty loud. But they\u2019re also easy to tune out, easy to dismiss as noise, as politics as usual. What\u2019s harder to ignore are the rituals. The reverence. The worship. The way power starts to look like something owed. We don\u2019t usually start naming highways after sitting presidents\u2014especially ones under multiple indictments, most especially ones wildly obsessed with power and openly musing about a third term. But here we are. A bill in Texas proposes to rename a stretch of I-35 the \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump Highway.\u201d It may not even pass, but that almost doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s one of a growing list of gestures aimed at deifying a man who, by any rational standard, should be facing serious consequences for his role in the January 6th insurrection\u2014an attack on the peaceful transfer of power that many legal scholars argue should disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment , if not result in criminal charges for inciting sedition. Instead, we get a slow-motion canonization. Lawmakers have floated putting Trump\u2019s face on currency, making his birthday a federal holiday, and renaming airports in his honor . Some supporters even want to carve his likeness into Mount Rushmore. Religious leaders compare him to biblical kings \u2014chosen vessels, sent by God. This isn\u2019t politics anymore. It\u2019s mythology. It\u2019s the construction of a parallel reality where Trump isn\u2019t just a man, but a savior figure. The kind of figure who can do no wrong, whose followers speak of him in reverent tones, who must be protected at all costs. This is how democratic values rot\u2014not all at once, but through the slow normalization of idolatry disguised as patriotism. But mythology only works if it can crowd out reality. Repression needs scaffolding\u2014and no tool is more effective than confusion. The Trump administration doesn\u2019t just clash with the press; it undermines the very concept of truth. \u201cFake news\u201d isn\u2019t a throwaway insult anymore\u2014it\u2019s a strategy. A sustained campaign to flood the information space and make facts feel optional. Reporters who challenge the administration are smeared as traitors or \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives. Trump still calls mainstream journalists \u201c the enemy of the people, \u201d echoing the language of the dictators and strongmen he seems to admire so much. Investigations are dismissed as partisan attacks. Whistleblowers are discredited before they speak. Independent newsrooms face lawsuits, threats, and coordinated disinformation campaigns designed to corrode public trust. And it works. The more chaotic the noise, the easier it is to tune out the signal. Truth becomes something to argue about, not act on. And once reality gets slippery, everything else is easier to break. Books get banned. Curricula get sanitized. Judges face harassment for upholding the law. Ordinary people start second-guessing what they post, what they share, what they say out loud. It doesn\u2019t take long for folks to forget what used to be obvious: opposition to authoritarianism is essential to a free society. *** I live in Austin, Texas, a city that prides itself on being an outlier inside a state that loves to talk about freedom while quietly legislating the opposite. This is a state where \u201csmall government\u201d somehow includes sweeping preemption laws, micromanaging what books kids can read, and controlling uteruses. The message is clear: freedom is fine\u2014as long as it\u2019s defined by those in power. Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country \u2014providers can face life in prison, and even individuals assisting in abortion access risk legal consequences, even in cases of rape or incest. In public schools, Bible-based curricula are slipping into classrooms under the name of \u201cvalues\u201d or \u201cpatriotism,\u201d incentivized by lawmakers. It\u2019s not freedom\u2014it\u2019s state-mandated morality dressed up as tradition. There\u2019s a reflex in this country\u2014maybe in every country\u2014to label dissent as disloyalty. Criticize the government, and suddenly you\u2019re \u201canti-American.\u201d I don\u2019t buy that. I love this country and the ideals it\u2019s supposed to stand for. When I enlisted in the Army and volunteered for the infantry, I swore an oath. I\u2019ve seen firsthand what it means to put your body on the line for a set of principles. Sure, my war was Iraq. And in hindsight, it\u2019s clear we weren\u2019t exactly defending American freedoms by invading a nation that had nothing to do with 9/11. But the men I served with\u2014some of whom never came home\u2014weren\u2019t there for oil or politics. They were there because they believed in service. Many had volunteered in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, willing to risk their lives to protect something bigger than themselves. They believed in the promise of liberty, accountability, and a system worth defending. And some of them probably support President Trump. I don\u2019t speak for them\u2014and while I respect their right to that choice, I won\u2019t pretend to understand it. But I do know what we all swore to uphold. Our oath wasn\u2019t to a man, or a party, or even a flag. It was to a Constitution\u2014one that\u2019s supposed to hold this nation together. (1) That\u2019s why this matters to me. When I see politicians twisting those principles into tools of repression, I don\u2019t call it patriotism. I call it what it is: a threat. And while there are many faces to that threat, perhaps none illustrates it more clearly right now than Elon Musk\u2014a man elected by no one, yet handed more control over federal institutions than most cabinet secretaries. His financial influence didn\u2019t just buy him a seat at the table. It bought him the table. *** Elon Musk\u2014billionaire, attention addict, CEO of everything\u2014holds real political power now. Not metaphorically, not just influence-by-Twitter (or X, or whatever that ad-choked echo chamber is calling itself today). Trump brought him in early to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency\u2014DOGE, which sounds like a joke until you realize it\u2019s not. As a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d Musk was handed sweeping authority to cancel contracts, slash programs, and restructure entire federal agencies. No election. No confirmation. No accountability\u2014except to Trump and his inner circle. Musk has used that power like a wrecking ball. USAID, gutted. The CFPB, gutted. The VA, slashed. Now the Department of Education is on the chopping block\u2014literally. Trump already signed the executive order to begin dismantling it, with the justification that schools should be governed \u201clocally.\u201d But the fallout is anything but local. Teachers\u2019 unions, the NAACP, and civil rights organizations are suing , warning that the move violates the Constitution and threatens to gut federal protections for vulnerable students. Meanwhile, DOGE\u2019s attempts to access sensitive agency data have been blocked by federal courts, citing privacy concerns and executive overreach. And like clockwork, Musk\u2019s signature chaos-management style has followed him into government: mass firings with little discernment, followed by quiet attempts to rehire the very people dismissed \u2014nuclear safety experts, pandemic response staff, oversight personnel\u2014when it turns out gutting institutions has consequences. Even Musk\u2019s own support is starting to wobble. His approval numbers have slipped. Protests have spread. Tesla cars have been vandalized, and a whole side hustle economy has popped up to cash in \u2014selling bumper stickers to owners who bought the car before they realized what kind of guy came with it. Movements like \u201c Tesla Takedown ,\u201d built around public shaming and targeted boycotts of Musk\u2019s brands, are picking up steam. Trump\u2019s base still defends him, mostly\u2014but they\u2019re beginning to sour on Musk. The golden boy of techno-libertarianism now looks a lot more like a self-dealing billionaire with too much control over their lives. Musk\u2019s role in the administration isn\u2019t just a weird twist of the Trump saga. It\u2019s a symptom of something much deeper: the corrosion of democratic norms in real time. When unelected billionaires are empowered to disassemble the federal government and profit from the fallout , we\u2019re not looking at innovation. We\u2019re looking at privatized power in patriotic packaging. Legal scholars are already sounding the alarm about a coming constitutional crisis. The rule of law is being selectively applied, courts are being ignored or sidelined, and the balance of power is being bent toward executive fiat. If the Constitution is a framework built on checks and balances, then we\u2019re watching those supports be quietly removed, one by one. This isn\u2019t hypothetical. It\u2019s happening. And if it continues unchecked, we\u2019re not just flirting with autocracy \u2014we\u2019re laying out a red carpet for it. And it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum. The courts have been methodically reengineered. Three Supreme Court justices were installed during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014after he lost the popular vote\u2014with help from a Senate that represents a minority of Americans. Lower courts have been stacked with ideologues who don\u2019t hide their contempt for civil rights. And then there are the laws\u2014quietly passed, easily overlooked\u2014that encourage citizens to snitch , sue, or surveil each other under the guise of morality or tradition. It\u2019s not just policy anymore; it\u2019s a culture shift. A moral panic turned into legislation. *** None of this is new. We\u2019ve seen this playbook before. Germany in the 1930s didn\u2019t collapse overnight. It slid\u2014through legal channels, institutional decay, and the slow boiling of norms. Russia didn\u2019t need a coup; it had bureaucracy, media control, and just enough plausible deniability. Hungary rewrote its constitution and wrapped its authoritarianism in flags and hymns. The slogans vary\u2014family, faith, purity, tradition\u2014but the structure is the same: consolidate power, erode checks, rebrand repression as righteousness. Here, it\u2019s not boots in the street\u2014it\u2019s bans in the library. It\u2019s teachers rewriting syllabi out of fear. It\u2019s protesters labeled extremists, and voting rights treated like optional extras. The message isn\u2019t \u201cyou can\u2019t speak.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s the whisper before the silence. I\u2019m not a paranoid person. I have no patience for conspiracy freaks or tinfoil logic. I try to root my thinking in science and history\u2014in what can be known, what can be verified. But even so, I\u2019m not immune to the quiet worries that slip through the cracks. I\u2019m writing this on a device connected to the internet. Nothing is truly private. Nothing online ever really disappears. That\u2019s not a problem with this essay\u2014I plan to publish it. But what about private messages? Notes? Conversations with AI? Whether we like it or not, tools like ChatGPT are becoming fixtures in daily life. People use them to draft emails, unpack personal dilemmas, or ask the kinds of questions they\u2019re not ready to say out loud. But these aren\u2019t confidants. They\u2019re algorithms trained to guess the next likely word. No mind, no morals, no memory. Are they logging dissent? Mapping behavior? Storing keywords for some future review? Maybe not. Or maybe not yet. But let\u2019s not underestimate the creativity of bad actors with power. The infrastructure exists. And if the political winds shift hard enough, all it takes is a flip of a switch. When it comes to tech abuse, the current administration\u2019s incompetence might actually be our last line of defense. These are, after all, the same people who planned a military strike in a Signal group chat\u2014and accidentally invited a journalist. If Orwell wrote fiction, these guys are writing farce. Jokes aside, the surveillance state doesn\u2019t need to be competent\u2014just connected. Metadata is already vacuumed up. GPS logs, browsing habits, biometric patterns\u2014all cross-referenced with identities. If this all sounds like dystopian fiction, that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve been trained to think of it that way. But it\u2019s not fiction. The systems are real. The only thing missing is the right justification: National security. Public order. \u201cFamily values.\u201d \u201cProtecting the children.\u201d And then comes the refrain: If you\u2019ve got nothing to hide, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear. That\u2019s how it always starts. *** The threat isn\u2019t abstract anymore. It\u2019s not looming\u2014it\u2019s embedded. Not with jackboots and batons\u2014though keep going down this road and we\u2019ll get there\u2014but with procedural language and patriotic branding. It waits for fatigue to set in. For outrage to give way to apathy. For protest to feel futile, and speaking up to feel like a risk. We\u2019ve been conditioned to treat comparisons to fascism as melodramatic. Alarmist. But sometimes, alarmist just means paying attention. When journalists are attacked, when courts are captured, when books are pulled from shelves and history is rewritten in real time, it\u2019s not alarmist to say the house is on fire. It\u2019s responsible. Authoritarianism doesn\u2019t need everyone to go silent\u2014just enough people afraid of making noise. It thrives on hesitation. On people weighing the cost of resistance against the ease of going along. That\u2019s the most dangerous part\u2014not the censorship itself, but the internalized version. The self-editing. The second-guessing. The voice that says: Maybe just let it go. Maybe don\u2019t post that. Maybe don\u2019t write this. But I\u2019d rather name it now than whisper about it later. If this country is still salvageable\u2014and I believe it is\u2014it won\u2019t be because we waited politely. It\u2019ll be because enough people chose not to. Because silence isn\u2019t safety. It\u2019s surrender in slow motion. *** To Those Who Still Support President Trump Maybe you still support Donald Trump and his approach to governing. A lot of people clearly do. Or maybe you just choose to look the other way. Either way, ask yourself this: what happens when the next president isn\u2019t your guy? When someone you don\u2019t trust\u2014someone you don\u2019t like and didn\u2019t vote for\u2014inherits the same unchecked authority, the same gutted institutions, the same executive branch reshaped for loyalty over law? To be fair, this didn\u2019t start with Trump. The power of the presidency has been sliding in this direction for decades. But he sure as hell didn\u2019t slow it down\u2014he stepped on the gas. And that\u2019s the thing about power: once it expands, it rarely contracts. The people who come next don\u2019t give it back\u2014they just find new ways to use it\u2026 to abuse it. The Founders weren\u2019t perfect, but they knew what concentrated power could do. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t build a throne\u2014they built limits. Guardrails. And we\u2019re watching those get stripped for parts. You might like who\u2019s driving now. But what happens when you don\u2019t?

That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft.

However, it\u2019d be even better if Elon focused more on striking closer to the root of the problem: the public\u2019s economic ignorance from which all the disastrous, coercive, competition-immune, monopolistic government central planning, spending, and also warmongering grows. This is precisely what Ludwig von Mises did, and I like to call it the \u201cMisesian formula\u201d for prosperity. Mises devoted parts of his majestic treatise Human Action (1949) to the formula. In a section aptly titled \u201cEconomics and the Citizen,\u201d Mises writes : 5-Minute Core Exercise... Dzenitis, Tami Brehse Best Price: $3.81 Buy New $8.68 (as of 03:36 UTC - Details ) Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man\u2019s human existence\u2026. All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of\u2026economics. Everybody\u2019s mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines\u2026. Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories\u2026. As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake\u2026. \u2026all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society\u2019s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen. Since it\u2019s real freedom and capitalism that lead to prosperity, explaining this to people is, per Mises, \u201c the primary civic duty .\u201d Riding the wave of economic education, Javier Milei had been spearheading on his way to electoral triumph in Argentina, on November 8, 2023 Elon tweeted a Hayek meme writing: \u201cBest economist ever.\u201d A week later, on December 4, he tweeted , \u201cGreat book by Hayek\u201d while linking to Hayek\u2019s classic book The Road To Serfdom , and another meme quoting Hayek : \u201cnothing could contribute more to the cure of humanity\u2019s ills than to give people a better understanding of economics .\u201d Elon is thus increasingly aware of the need to educate, but still far from having a Misesian ethos-understanding. Mankind\u2019s problems are overwhelmingly the result of the public\u2019s economic ignorance which then, via democracy, manifests itself in the order-destroying bureaucracies. It is their ignorance\u2014that of your neighbor, family members, and likely former self\u2014that is near the root of the problem, not whatever homo sapiens people vote for. The very root of this economic ignorance, as significantly shown by founder of the \u201cAustrian School of Economics,\u201d Carl Menger, is the fact that money (and its vital emerging benefits like profit-loss calculation), trade, the division of labor, economic competition, etc. are\u2014to borrow Adam Ferguson\u2019s popular phrase \u2014\u201cindeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.\u201d Hardly anyone, and much less people of significant influence, likely including Elon, are aware of this. One of my favorite little-known Libertarian books is Walter Block\u2019s I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians , which contains over 80 autobiographical essays-interviews of leading libertarians/free marketeers like Walter himself, Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, Peter Boettke, etc., describing how they became libertarians/free marketeers. It is easy to see how many of them went from being ignorant big government, socialist myth-believers to champions of freedom and emerging civilization, by stumbling upon sound economics. Mises (1881-1973) died long before the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) and pro-capitalist reforms in China, thus he spent his lifetime fighting a losing intellectual battle, as socialist myths expanded their control of more countries. He writes : From time to time I entertained the hope that my writings would bear practical fruit and point policy in the right direction. I have always looked for evidence of a change in ideology. But I never actually deceived myself; my theories explain, but cannot slow the decline of a great civilization. I set out to be a reformer, but only became the historian of decline. After WWI, he carried the same determination in his Atlas-like intellectual-educational efforts: How one carries on in the face of unavoidable catastrophe is a matter of temperament\u2026. Again and again I had met with situations from which rational deliberation found no means of escape; but then the unexpected intervened, and with it came salvation. I would not lose courage even now. I wanted to do everything an economist could do. I would not tire in saying what I knew to be true. Mises again , in Human Action : \u2026in the field of social organization and economic policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doctrines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such thing as an unpopular system of government\u2026. The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowledge. It determines the whole process of human history\u2026. \u2026great men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans if they do not convince public opinion. The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority. Mises\u2019s wisdom above predicts what is happening to Elon and his DOGE, and again highlights the need to \u201cconvince public opinion.\u201d Although Elon has gained support from many, a large percentage of the economically-ignorant public is increasingly, fanatically against Elon\u2019s efforts. Bolshevik-like, intellectually dangerous ideologues like Robert Reich have been constantly spewing anti-economics and violence-inducing class-warfare rhetoric. For example, on March 12, 2025, Reich wrote in Facebook: Elon Musk is trying to steal the federal government \u2014 slashing public services, firing civil servants, and handing power to billionaires like himself. I salute the brave public servants who are resisting this coup. This type of mindset by the economically ignorant masses have made Musk one of the most hated men in America, to be destroyed via lawfare and even physical violence. From January 29 to March 10, 2025, there have been 9 attacks on Tesla locations . On March 10, X/Twitter suffered a relatively massive outage which, at the time, Elon felt originated in Ukraine, showing the potential dangers of being against the interests of millions vested in neocon warfare. I would not be surprised if SpaceX and Tesla are already\u2014or will eventually be\u2014victims of internal sabotage. Statistically, as the anti-Elon dice keep getting rolled at an increasing rate, he will likely be brought down somehow. Besides, as Vincent Cook\u2019s article \u201c Is DOGE a Dog When It Comes to Real Federal Spending? \u201d shows, there are too many legal obligations for DOGE to make significant cuts. Elon is attacking the symptoms of economic ignorance, not the root causes like Mises did. With a more Misesian intellectual background and educational strategy, Javier Milei\u2014similar to Ron Paul\u2014managed to educate enough people to win the presidency of Argentina. In an interview with Ben Shapiro, Milei explained how the intellectual revolution grew from economic education: The Next Civil War: Di... Marche, Stephen Best Price: $10.12 Buy New $13.64 (as of 10:51 UTC - Details ) This time young people were really educated. We would organize what we called the concerts. They were political rallies\u2026 At these rallies we had stands\u2026with books. Minister Bullrich\u2026said something brilliant, \u201cyou should pay more attention to what Milei is doing. It\u2019s not normal for a politician to be talking to 20 or 30 thousand people about Hayek.\u201d Young people started to evangelize at home with their parents and grandparents. Mises wrote : Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority\u2026 It has full confidence in man\u2019s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future. In other words, we must believe that we can educate \u201cthe immense majority,\u201d and thus act accordingly, even if it proves to be futile, otherwise \u201cthere is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future.\u201d Mises concludes Human Action : The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the human race. Note : The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More A year before global markets were upended by President Trump's tariffs, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned shareholders of the rising threat of China's electric vehicle makers. In Tesla's Q4 earnings call on January 24, 2024, Mr Musk said: The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They are extremely good. I'm aware this story could go in many directions from here. But I'll focus on China's biggest EV maker, its rising dominance, and the implications for ASX lithium shares . Last week, I wrote a story that looked at whether or not the plunging lithium price had finally hit the bottom . A key factor that will determine where the price of lithium will go from here is demand, particularly Chinese demand. The latest Resources and Energy Quarterly report states that global lithium demand is forecast to grow by almost 13% a year to 2030. A closer look reveals forecasts of increased demand for lithium are largely based on expectations of increased uptake of electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. And BYD , which has now overtaken Tesla to become the biggest supplier of EVs in the world, will play a significant part in fuelling that demand. In 2024, more than 90% of Australia's lithium exports were shipped to China, and the Middle Kingdom's appetite for lithium shows no sign of slowing down. Chinese demand for lithium is set to rise as the biggest player in the EV space continues to expand despite tariff implications. In 2024, BYD reported that it had delivered 4.24 million vehicles, up from around 3 million the previous year. Charging ahead BYD is now selling almost as many vehicles as Ford, an astonishing feat for a company that has been around for only 30 years. This year, the company is projecting that it will deliver about 5.5 million EVs. It's likely that President Trump's tariffs will do little to slow BYD's rising dominance in the electric vehicle market. BYD's biggest market is China, where rising adoption rates of electric vehicles contributed to global EV sales growth of 26% last year. Other key markets for BYD include Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. And momentum is continuing into 2025 and beyond. Analysts at JPMorgan have raised their estimate for BYD's vehicle deliveries for 2026 to 6.5 million units. As BYD continues its astronomical growth path, it will have a material impact on global lithium demand. I'm not suggesting that all this means that the price of lithium has hit the floor. But it does seem clear that the signs do point to a more optimistic outlook for ASX-listed lithium players, including Pilbara Minerals Ltd ( ASX: PLS ), Minerals Resources Ltd ( ASX: MIN ), and Liontown Resources Ltd ( ASX: LTR ).

The Chinese government is drafting a new regulatory system for exports, and while the policies are being framed, the shipments of the magnets, essential for the manufacturing of almost everything ranging from cars to missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports, according to a report by The New York Times. Per the report, once the new regulatory system is in place, it could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors. US Dependency On Chinese Imports The official crackdown on exports is part of Beijing's retaliation against US President Trump's punishing trade war. China produces around 90 per cent of the world's rare earths, a group of 17 elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and electronics industries. Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related items, have been placed on the export control list. The United States has only one rare earths mine, and most of its supply comes from China. Beijing placed export restrictions on rare earth elements on April 2 as part of a broader package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump's decision to hike tariffs against most Chinese products to 54 per cent. The export curbs include not only mined minerals but permanent magnets and other finished products that will be difficult to replace, analysts said. The move, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further ratchets up trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and leaves American manufacturers scrambling for fresh supplies of the critical minerals they have relied upon for decades. Now, metals and special magnets made with them can only be shipped out of China with special export licenses, the NYT report said. However, Beijing's system to issue these licenses is barely in place, which is causing consternation among industry executives that the process could drag on and that current supplies of minerals and products outside of China could run low. A Move To Exert Dominance The move, which affects exports to all countries, not just the US, is the latest demonstration of China's ability to weaponize its dominance over the mining and processing of the critical minerals. While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, Beijing can throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it issues. Lockheed Martin, Tesla and Apple are among the US companies that use Chinese rare earths in their supply chains. The US government has stockpiles of some rare earths, but not enough to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity. Beijing has already imposed outright bans on the export of three metals to the US and slapped export controls on many others. The moves to restrict heavy rare earths are especially important because China has even tighter control over these elements, David Merriman at consultancy Project Blue, told Reuters. \"There is currently only one HREE (heavy rare earth element) focused operation outside of China, Myanmar and Laos,\" he said, adding that China has close involvement in supply chains from Myanmar and Laos. Why Rare Metals Are Important For The US The heavy rare earth metals put under export suspension by China are used in magnets-- essential for many kinds of electric motors used in the manufacturing of electric cars, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft and gasoline-powered cars. These metals are required for the manufacturing of jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs and capacitors, which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The US and China remain mired in a seemingly never-ending bout of one-upmanship, characterized by tit-for-tat trade levies and strategic export bans, which, in the case of the US, revolve around semiconductors, while China has now flexed its own muscles by restricting the export of rare earth metals. In this highly volatile situation, a Tesla patent from 2023 could be the answer to the conundrum of de-risking America's supply chains, at least where rare earth metals are concerned.

In contrast to the commonly held view, the US can't just start refining its own copious rare earth resources at the flip of a switch, for such a feat requires an intricate interplay of massive funding, energy, infrastructure, and vertically integrated supply chain partners. While the US can certainly establish its own rare earth domain, it would likely require the better part of a decade. Slitted Magnet for Selective Coercivity: Tesla's Novel Approach to Rare Earth Metal Reduction @Tesla 's WO2024097176A1 patent introduces an innovative magnet manufacturing technique that transforms electric vehicle motor production through strategic cavity-based doping. By\u2026 pic.twitter.com/tZcaJ03OPG \u2014 SETI Park (@seti_park) December 4, 2024 So, what's the solution in the interim? Well, one idea centers around significantly reducing the use of rare earth metals in key industrial processes, and Tesla might offer one such avenue worth pursuing. To wit, in a patent filed back in 2023, bearing the international publication number WO2024097176A1 , Tesla describes a 'keyhole surgery-like process' to significantly reduce the need for rare earth metals in the manufacturing process of electric motors. The process involves the creation of \"controlled-depth cavities (0.2-1.5mm wide) in magnet structure,\" which then allow for the introduction of specific dopants. According to the patent, the process achieves desired magnetic properties while significantly reducing rare earth metal usage and manufacturing complexity. Of course, it remains unclear if Tesla is using this approach in its gigafactories, and to what extent. However, the approach does stand out for its simplicity and, therefore, could constitute a viable avenue for de-risking America's intertwined supply chains.

But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. AP Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump 's first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company's Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google's co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley's environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what's happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. Live Events \"One of the things I've seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\" Lyons said.

But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. \"I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\" said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry. \"The shift hasn't been for a lot of people,\" said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \"It's a handful of people who've gotten the attention.\" The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of the world's best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House 's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk . Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. \"We're still in the belly of the beast,\" said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \"If the lake was frozen, there's a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\" The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington's business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world's problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers' dreams of changing the world for the better. Google's motto was \"don't be evil,\" a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. \"Now,\" she said, \"if you're part of a startup, you're hoping you'll be absorbed in a way that's profitable.\" Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. \"I feel sick to my stomach now,\" she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. \"I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\" Sylvester said. \"It was not all OK.\" It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump's challenges to the country's system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley's top executives. \"The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\" said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \"Unfortunately, you've got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\" \"Just coming here, everyone's saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\" Wood added. \"We're all scared.\" Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. \"The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.\" Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition Asian Paints is trading at P/E lower than pandemic levels.

Deal details: Existing backers, including Singaporean sovereign fund GIC, Peak XV Partners, Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, QED, among others are in discussions to invest $100-$200 million in Cred\u2019s latest financing, people in the know told us. The round could value Cred anywhere between $3.5-4 billion, a significant drop from its $6.4 billion valuation in 2022 . Valuation correction: If the round goes through, the Kunal Shah-led Cred may become one of the first major fintechs to raise venture funding at a markdown from its 2022 peak. Despite steady revenue growth and positive cash flow, sources said Cred\u2019s decision to pursue a down round reflects broader market realities. Between 2021 and 2022, the startup\u2019s valuation jumped from $3.4 billion to $6.4 billion in a year\u2019s time. Global fintech reset: Silicon Valley-based payments giant Stripe slashed its valuation from a 2021 peak of $95 billion to $50 billion last year . Earlier this year, Stripe disclosed that investors purchased employee shares through a tender offer at a $91.5 billion valuation. Swedish fintech firm Klarna saw its valuation plunge from $46 billion to $6.7 billion. Having delayed its IPO, Klarna now aims for a valuation above $15 billion when it eventually lists . Pushing growth: The fresh capital would help Cred accelerate growth across its business lines spanning lending, insurance, ecommerce and digital payments. Part of the funding may also bolster its lending arm, Newtap Finance, which aims to play a larger role in Cred's expanding financial services portfolio.

Funding woes: The company's monthly cash burn exceeds Rs 20 crore, prompting the decision to wind down its core operations. Earlier this year, a $50 million fundraising effort collapsed after existing investors refused to inject fresh capital. Financial troubles have deepened due to a debt crisis at Gensol Engineering, a firm backed by BluSmart founders Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. This has further constrained access to funds for the ride-hailing business. What else: Once BluSmart\u2019s vehicles are listed on Uber, the startup will receive a share of fare revenues while Uber retains its standard commission\u2014just as it does with other fleet operators or individual driver partners. Leadership exodus: Several senior BluSmart executives have recently stepped down, including fleet CEO Anirudh Arun, chief technology officer Rishabh Sood, and chief business officer Tushar Garg, formerly of Uber India.

Investment details: Sudip Ghose, founder of Uppercase, revealed that the company will collaborate with Bumrah to develop a new line of products, including luggage, backpacks, and gym bags, designed primarily for athletes. Bumrah will receive a share of the profits from these items.

Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary: Electronics tariff exemptions are temporary, chip tariffs coming soon The goods will soon fall under a new semiconductor-specific tariff policy, likely within two months By AP- PTI Updated - April 14, 2025 at 07:33 AM. | Nashville US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The ongoing ambiguity has rattled markets, especially Big Tech firms like Apple and Nvidia, with experts warning of severe disruption to supply chains and investor confidence. | Photo Credit: NATHAN HOWARD/Reuters Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no \u201cexception\u201d at all because the goods are \u201cjust moving to a different\" bucket and will still face a 20 per cent tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren't usually made in the US The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won't be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. Also read Apple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India to beat Trump tariffs, sources say It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was \u201ctaking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Also read Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. Comments Published on April 14, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS. THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS.

Queens Councilman Robert Holden said he doesn\u2019t want his neighborhood to turn into a potential \u201cmini-Chernobyl\u201d The site, which is now vacant at 64-30 69th Place, stands next to a daycare and preschool (Books & Rattles, Inc.), the Juniper Valley Animal Hospital and also lies across the street from PS 128. NineDot Energy spokesperson Karen Alter, when contacted by The Post, said the Brooklyn-based firm had not made a \u201cfinal decision on moving forward.\u201d In a copy of emails with community officials obtained by The Post, NineDot rep Sam Brill defended the safety of such battery sites, including a NineDot battery facility in the Bronx, that for years has \u201csafely operated\u201d 40 feet from a public school. \u201cFDNY wouldn\u2019t let us build these if they weren\u2019t safe,\u201d Brill said.

Archive Magazine Save this story Save Save this story Save The wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk , celebrated on his social media site X late Friday, writing that the \u201cpronoun bs is finally going away.\u201d \u201cThat was silly,\u201d Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency and has been slashing crucial federal funding for months, wrote after reposting a pronoun knock-knock joke. \u201cThank god Trump won,\u201d a user named TheDogeGlory replied below Musk\u2019s post, to which he responded with a bullseye emoji. Musk\u2019s post comes days after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that administration officials would refrain from responding to inquiries from journalists who include their preferred pronouns in email signatures or bios. \u201cAs a matter of policy,\u201d Leavitt wrote in an email from a reporter asking about the closure of a research observatory , \u201cwe do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk arrives on stage at an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Samuel Corum/Getty Images President Donald Trump \u2019s administration, in January, instructed federal employees to remove any reference to their identifying pronouns from their email signatures and other forms as a part of the broad effort to roll back any and all evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Or, as a Texas state employee found out , get fired. Leavitt\u2019s admission this week confirms that the press office is following suit. \u201cAny reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,\u201d the press secretary, who in just a few short months since Trump has taken office has gained a reputation as combative toward both individual journalists and legacy media in general, said in a separate statement to other news outlets. Axios also confirmed on Wednesday that officials will continue to skirt these reporters, asking Trump spokesperson Harrison Fields if that was now their official policy. \u201cFACTS!\u201d he replied. As The New York Times reported this week, \u201cOn at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters\u2019 questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.\u201d A spokesperson for the Times said, \u201cEvading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d they continued, \u201crefusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration\u2019s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025. JIM WATSON/Getty Images In one instance, Matt Berg , a reporter at Crooked Media, the network that runs the \u201cPod Save America\u201d family of podcasts, decided to experiment with the new administration\u2019s handling of journalists who include their pronouns. Berg doesn\u2019t usually include pronouns in his email signature. But, when he included \u201che/him\u201d in an email to Katie Miller , a senior adviser at DOGE, he too was met with a response claiming that the use of pronouns is detrimental to science, that it was her policy to refuse to respond to journalists with listed pronouns, and that he was ignoring facts. \u201cI find it baffling that they care more about pronouns than giving journalists accurate information, but here we are,\u201d Berg said in an email to the Times . The press office has previously been harsh on reporters who do not use the language they prefer. In February, Leavitt and the administration blocked The Associated Press from covering multiple White House events because it refused to change its editorial style from \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds and won\u2014though the White House said it would be appealing. Dozens of protesters gather in Times Square near a military recruitment center to show their anger at President Donald Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017 in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The White House\u2019s handling of pronouns aligns with the president\u2019s coordinated rollback of protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans and those who support them. Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people. In his first moments in office, the president signed an order declaring that the United States would only recognize two sexes, \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale,\u201d as defined at conception\u2014a move that required government agencies to use an outdated and scientifically inaccurate gender binary on documents like passports, visas, and employee records. He also signed others aimed at barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls\u2019 sports teams, restricting funding for gender-affirming care for people under 19, and removing transgender service members from the military. Multiple of Trump\u2019s orders against transgender people are being challenged in the courts. For Musk, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s discussed preferred pronouns on X, formerly Twitter. In 2022, he wrote , \u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.\u201d And in June of 2023, on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he would allow users to intentionally misgender someone without consequence. He also claimed that he personally would use the pronouns that someone prefers for manners\u2019 sake\u2014something he has repeatedly chosen not to do with his own daughter .

Agencies Confidential internal documents leaked following a cyberattack on NetJets, the private aviation firm owned by Berkshire Hathaway. They have reportedly exposed a detailed in-flight service guide tailored exclusively for Elon Musk on private jets, offering rare insight into the billionaire\u2019s airborne lifestyle, as per a report by Bloomberg. The document, first reported by Bloomberg, provides flight attendants with precise instructions on how to cater to the personal and professional preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, reflecting the meticulous attention given to his comfort and routine while in transit. Speed, Silence and Solitude: Inside the Jet Cabin According to the hacked manual, Elon Musk prefers direct and rapid routes regardless of fuel efficiency, a somewhat paradoxical position for the head of an electric vehicle empire known for sustainability. \u201cMr. Musk isn\u2019t interested in conserving fuel,\u201d the memo states, noting that his priority is to \u201cfly as quickly and as direct as possible.\u201d Live Events Onboard, the environment is kept controlled to Musk\u2019s liking: a cool cabin temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, dimmed lighting, and passenger vents turned off due to his aversion to background noise. Unexpected Wi-Fi dropouts are to be avoided at all costs, and staff are advised not to offer unsolicited help with technology, as Musk considers himself \u201cself-sufficient.\u201d Gaming in the Sky: Musk\u2019s Late-Night Livestreams Beyond the logistics of luxury travel, Musk has been using his time in the air to test Starlink\u2019s airborne connectivity, streaming video games from his private jet to millions of viewers. In a recent livestream that attracted over 16 million views, Musk played for 44 minutes, occasionally commenting on topics ranging from turbulence and artificial intelligence to the upcoming season of \"Diablo IV.\" Speaking into the camera in the early hours of April 10, he reflected on personal challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a stressful week, frankly. But today was a good day,\u201d Musk said, moments before resuming gameplay. These livestreams, often broadcast under his alias @cyb3rgam3r420, have become a regular feature of his travel routine, even showing glimpses of his son or spontaneous thoughts about Roman military history or Tesla\u2019s future tech ventures. Gaming Under Scrutiny Despite the casual tone of these videos, Musk has faced criticism within the gaming community. A previous exchange with a YouTuber, NikoWrex, suggested Musk may have considered \"account boosting\" \u2014 a controversial practice where gamers pay others to improve their rankings. The allegation drew ire from gamers and even prompted snark from official game accounts. Musk, while never officially commenting on the claims, did amplify the video in question. However, critics argue that his recent \u201chardcore mode\u201d failures during livestreams \u2014 including multiple in-game deaths and connection issues \u2014 cast doubt on his self-professed gaming prowess. FAQs What was leaked in the NetJets cyberattack? Internal documents from NetJets, a private aviation company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, were leaked following a cyberattack. These include a confidential service guide specifically tailored for Elon Musk, offering detailed insight into his travel preferences and routines aboard private jets. What does the guide reveal about Elon Musk\u2019s travel preferences? Musk prefers fast, direct flights regardless of fuel efficiency. He also requires a cabin temperature of 65\u00b0F, dim lighting, and no use of passenger air vents to reduce background noise. Flight attendants are instructed not to offer tech assistance unless asked.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any \u201cfurther unlawful and unfair action\u201d against OpenAI in a court case over the company\u2019s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution. OpenAI claims that Musk has tried \u201cnonstop\u201d to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using \u201cbad-faith tactics\u201d against it to help him control AI technology. Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a \u201cfor-profit\u201d company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity. OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now and 9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today \u201cThrough press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk\u2019s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI\u2019s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,\u201d In response, Musk\u2019s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI. \u201cHad OpenAI\u2019s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It\u2019s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI\u2019s assets allegedly \u2018interferes\u2019 with their business plans.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): AI Vision Versus EV Weakness - Goldman Balances Long-Term Hopes with Near-Term Risks Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On April 10, Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cNeutral\u201d and cut its price target on the stock to $260 per share from $275. \u201cFor Tesla , we believe that weaker auto demand/consumer sentiment, tariff costs (including in Energy), and US EV policy risk are offset by longer-term potential from its AI related efforts;\u201d Overall, TSLA ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Elon Musk. Elon Musk has been steadily losing popularity among Americans, according to claims made by pollster Nate Silver in his latest tracker. However, Silver's assessment has drawn sharp retort from Tesla CEO Musk who blasted the ratings as \"political propaganda war\". \"We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125,\" Silver posted on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter). Replying to Silver's tweet, Musk wrote, \"The inevitable outcome of having a political propaganda war waged against me while I have almost no countervailing campaign and, at times, digging my own grave way better than my enemies do.\" Silver \"Do Americans have a favorable or unfavorable view of Elon Musk\" tracker shows statistics from January 1, 2024 till April 1, 2025. The timeline comprises Musk's endorsement for then Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, US President elections, and Donald Trump's inauguration and subsequent decisions that Trump administration has taken. Earlier on Thursday, two U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers on Thursday asked the Transportation Department's top ethics official to detail how the agency is addressing Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest given ongoing investigations of SpaceX and Tesla, companies run by the close ally of President Donald Trump. Live Events Meanwhile, Ireland's data privacy watchdog said on Friday it's investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X over its use of personal data to train his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. The Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into \"the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts\" that European users posted on X. FAQs Q1.

In a bold interview with EFN, Gardell called Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and pointed to slowing sales, Elon Musk\u2019s political drama, and Cybertruck struggles as red flags. While Tesla leads in EV innovation, Gardell warns the bubble could soon burst. Swedish billionaire Christer Gardell warns Tesla stock may crash 95%. He says the valuation is unrealistic and linked to Elon Musk\u2019s controversies, falling sales, and Cybertruck struggles Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell has issued a stark warning that\u2019s now catching the attention of Tesla investors worldwide. According to Gardell, Tesla\u2019s market valuation is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and could plummet by up to 95% \u2014 and possibly sooner than many might expect. In a recent interview with Swedish finance channel EFN, Gardell didn\u2019t hold back. He pointed to a mix of slowing sales, rising controversy around CEO Elon Musk, and what he sees as wildly overinflated stock value. Why is Christer Gardell calling Tesla\u2019s valuation a ticking time bomb? Tesla's current market value sits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But Gardell, who runs activist hedge fund Cevian Capital, says that figure doesn\u2019t align with Tesla\u2019s core business. \u201cTesla, especially now with the whole Musk circus going on everywhere, is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now,\u201d Gardell said in the EFN interview, as reported by Teslarati . \u201cIt could go down 95% \u2013 and maybe it should go down 95%.\u201d He clarified that it\u2019s hard to predict an exact timeline \u2014 \u201cIt could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years,\u201d he said. But in his eyes, a drop is coming. And when it hits, it could be steep. Live Events What\u2019s driving fears of a Tesla stock crash? Tesla has moved beyond just being an electric carmaker. The company now deals in robotics and AI, which are both major growth areas. But Gardell emphasized that, at its core, Tesla is still an automaker \u2014 and compared to its peers, its stock is way out of proportion. According to Companies Market Cap , Tesla\u2019s valuation is more than triple that of major auto giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Yet, Tesla\u2019s recent sales trends are not keeping up. Sales have dipped in key markets, and the controversial public presence of Elon Musk hasn\u2019t helped. As political tensions around Musk grow \u2014 especially in the U.S. \u2014 some analysts worry that Tesla\u2019s reputation could be taking a long-term hit. That\u2019s not just bad PR; it could mean real consequences for investor confidence. On top of that, Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated Cybertruck is underperforming. While Musk once projected annual sales of 500,000 units, current figures suggest it\u2019s not even hitting 10% of that. To move the product, Tesla has been forced to adjust financing options and offer more attractive interest rates to buyers. Could a Tesla crash ripple through the EV market? Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV market continues to thrive. In fact, Q4 2024 saw a new record for EV sales in the U.S., according to Cox Automotive . People are still switching to electric vehicles in large numbers, attracted by long-term savings and environmental benefits. But here\u2019s the concern: If Tesla's valuation tanks, will it scare investors away from other EV companies too? It's a real risk. Gardell's worry is that an overvalued company like Tesla might damage broader investor trust in green tech if it falls too hard and too fast. Still, it's not all bad news for EV buyers. As Tesla trims prices and tweaks financing to maintain demand, competitors may follow suit. That could lead to better deals for consumers, not just from Tesla but across the EV landscape. Should investors start looking beyond U.S. tech stocks? Gardell believes the stock market imbalance between the U.S. and Europe is reaching historic levels. \u201cThe difference between American stocks and European stocks has never been greater,\u201d he told EFN. For cautious investors, this may be a moment to reconsider their strategy. European equities, in his view, are offering more realistic valuations. And with companies in Europe also expanding into the EV and clean energy space, there may be opportunities to invest in future-forward industries without the same bubble risk. FAQs: Why did Christer Gardell warn about a Tesla stock crash ? He said Tesla\u2019s value is too high and could drop by 95%. How could Tesla\u2019s stock affect the electric vehicle market? A crash could shake investor trust in EV companies.

And while many of us might not quite be billionaires just yet, a handful of Georgians already are. Forbes released its annual list of the world\u2019s richest people earlier this week, with a total net worth between them all of $16.1 trillion. The richest man in the world saw his worth skyrocket in the last year. Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk currently has a net worth of $342 billion, according to Forbes. Last year, he had a total of $195 billion, their data lists. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks ] But the richest Georgians are the children of Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, who died in 2014. Bubba and Dan Cathy now run the fast food powerhouse together. The brothers and their sister, Trudy Cathy White, each have a net worth of $11.4 billion, which is slightly higher than last year\u2019s $11.2 billion. Metro Atlanta-based Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank has a current net worth of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Blank also owns the Atlanta Falcons and opened Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta - Arthur M. Blank Hospital in September .

In his spare time, James is a long-suffering Rochdale fan and loves reading, running and music. Contact him via [email protected] X @ JimmyMoorhouse Advert Advert Advert Love him or hate him, Elon Musk has been part of some pretty wild projects over the years. Having one of his own cars up in space is perhaps one of the most random. While the Space X founder has lost plenty on Tesla stock in recent months, with Donald Trump 's tariffs only leaving more holes in his pocket , he remains the world's richest man and probably doesn't blink twice when a couple of million evaporates from his bank account. The businessman has taken on more of a political role since Trump's return to the Oval Office. This has hardly done much for the 53-year-old's controversial image, and it seems as though the South African's best work has been beyond Earth's orbit, given the success of various space projects over the years. Running a space company and a car business simultaneously, if you've got a mind like Musk, it's likely you'd put two and two together and send a Tesla up to the stars - and that's exactly what he did in 2018. Advert The Tesla Roadster was ejected into space as a dummy payload for a Falcon Heavy test flight. It's fitted with a mannequin in a space suit called Starman - a tongue-in-cheek nod to the David Bowie classic. The Bowie song Space Oddity was also set up to play on repeat through the vehicle's sound system. The SpaceX team also chucked a Hot Wheels car and a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside for good measure. Elon Musk (Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk previously revealed exactly why he sent the Tesla Roadster skyward, saying that he hoped that humanity would end up living on other planets and that his 'descendants will be able to drag it [the car] back to a museum'. The chances of that may seem pretty low, but the more kids Musk has, the more those chances improve. Musk has also said that he wanted to put the 'silliest' thing he and his SpaceX team could think of out of Earth's orbit, and apparently they settled on a car. Gosh, Elon, your imagination knows no bounds! Anyway, after seven years in space travelling at speeds well above 10,000 mph, you might think that it's tricky to keep track of the Roadster, but fortunately, like nearly everything these days, there's a website for that. Advert The \u2018Where is Roadster?\u2019 site keeps track of the Tesla as it zooms through space. At the time of writing, it is currently 228,647,460 miles from Earth. However, it's travelling back towards its home planet at the lightning-fast speed of 16,106 mph. A real space oddity... (SpaceX via Getty Images) That means that its speed has increased by 5,000 mph in the last week alone. Maybe it's homesick and wants to get back in time for Christmas, learning an important lesson from the NASA astronauts who end up spending far too long away from Earth. So what happens when the space car does finally come back home? Well, Musk could land himself in real trouble if the Tesla does crash land back to Earth. As long as it steers clear of any humans or man-made objects and doesn't cause any damage, it seems as if the billionaire will get away with it. Hopefully it avoids the likes of Mount Kilimanjaro and Niagara Falls, too.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

(Provided by Consumer Reports) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially , and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk\u2019s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn\u2019t about a quick return on investment. It\u2019s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it a grift , pointing to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising and underdelivering . But the market is increasingly more tolerant \u2013 welcoming, even \u2013 of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president\u2019s right-hand men. \u201cAll of Elon\u2019s companies today are basically one company,\u201d Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.\u201d The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that \u201cevery single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,\u201d as Baron phrased it . Other businesses under Musk\u2019s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink \u2013 some of which reportedly share resources . \u201cWhen [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there\u2019s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok [\u2026] and you\u2019re gonna have connected cars all around the world? [\u2026] All these businesses link up. It\u2019s the ecosystem. It\u2019s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it\u2019s really interesting when you look at it that way.\u201d Baron Capital has invested across Musk\u2019s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire\u2019s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk\u2019s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren\u2019t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true when it comes to Musk\u2019s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it has automaker margins , based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \u201cThe reason why [Tesla\u2019s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it\u2019s not about what happens to numbers this year,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s one of Elon\u2019s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.\u201d Munster\u2019s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It\u2019s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X\u2019s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI\u2019s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland\u2019s DPC , which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe\u2019s GDPR law. \u201cAnother kind of risk here is that there isn\u2019t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you\u2019re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,\u201d Wang said. \u201cA lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information [\u2026] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.\u201d Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere for the last several months, Elon\u2019s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.\u201d When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they\u2019re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI\u2019s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. \u201cWe\u2019re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the value [\u2026] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?\u201d Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren\u2019t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk\u2019s superpower to \u201cbend capital markets to his will\u201d in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. \u201cThe people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,\u201d Rechtman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.\u201d Not for nothing, buying into Musk\u2019s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. \u201cSpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon\u2019s good graces.\u201d Topics AI , Elon Musk , Grok , Social , X , xAI Rebecca Bellan Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.
