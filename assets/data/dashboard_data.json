Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 Much to the annoyance of Democrats , Elon Musk has become a prominent figure in President Donald Trump 's administration. The Tesla CEO has spearheaded efforts to reduce the deficit by at least $1 trillion, held private meetings on Capitol Hill, and even attended cabinet meetings. However, Musk's growing influence in Washington may become a central factor in a Democratic resurgence in the 2026 midterms. In recent weeks, Musk's approval ratings have plummeted. A recent poll conducted by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies and Harris, which surveyed 2,746 registered voters between March 26 and 27, found that 49 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, compared to just 39 percent who view him favorably. This is a sharp decline from February, when 44 percent said they viewed Musk favorably, and an equal percentage viewed him unfavorably. Similarly, a YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between April 5-8 among 1,563 registered voters, showed a drop in Musk's favorability from 44 percent in January to 40 percent. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters view him unfavorably, an increase from 48 percent in January. Pollster Nate Silver 's tracker also shows Musk's approval rating deep underwater, with 54 percent of Americans viewing him unfavorably and 40 percent viewing him favorably.

Since joining the Trump administration, Musk has aggressively pushed for policies aimed at slashing government spending, rolling back regulations, and downsizing the federal workforce, all in his role as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These efforts have triggered a series of legal challenges and widespread public backlash. Just last week, thousands gathered in a series of global \"Hands Off!\" protests, expressing outrage over Musk's attempts to gut federal agencies and cut the federal workforce. Hundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations have also taken place, urging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and shares of the company's stock in protest of Musk. In March, its market value fell by 4 percent. Musk's political clout was also shaken this month by the defeat of Brad Schimel, the Trump-backed judicial candidate, who lost to Susan Crawford by a 9-point margin in Wisconsin, despite Musk pouring millions of dollars into backing the Republican candidate. Since then, political analysts and GOP strategists have pointed to Musk's increasingly polarizing image as a key factor in the loss.

Alishia Abodunde/Getty Images \"It was clear that his efforts to take a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are deeply unpopular with the majority of voters,\" Democratic strategist Doug Gordon told Newsweek . In response, a group of 77 House Democrats, led by Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Greg Casar, is launching a campaign to force Musk to resign from his position at DOGE by May 30, saying it is \"for the good of the country.\" Amid Musk's declining popularity, Democrats are starting to see a path to recovery in the 2026 midterms after the party faced a humiliating defeat in the 2024 election, with Trump improving his vote share in almost every state, and the Republicans taking the House and the Senate . Pollster Adam Carlson suggested that Democrats could adopt a strategy similar to the one Republicans used in 2010, when they targeted then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , whose low favorability ratings made her a more effective target than President Barack Obama , who was still relatively popular. Carlson argued that Musk, much like Pelosi at the time, could become a potent symbol for Democratic opposition, particularly if his favorability continues to decline while Trump's approval remains stable due to the loyalty of his base. However, recent polls have shown Trump's approval rating declining as well. \"Musk could serve as a powerful 'bonus bogeyman' for Democrats, particularly in tight races across the House, Senate, and state-level contests,\" Carlson said. \"As we saw in Wisconsin last week, Musk is so electorally toxic that just the idea of him might be enough.\" Carlson also noted that while Democrats should focus their attacks on Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms, \"having that bonus bogeyman who is loathed by swing voters could be pivotal in key House, Senate, governor, and downballot races.\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, agreed, telling Newsweek : \"Elon Musk will certainly have a political target on his back in the 2026 midterms. The fact that DOGE is waning in popularity, and many voters resent Musk trying to buy elections with his wealth, will serve as energizers for the Democratic base.\" \"Musk does offer the Democrats an advantage in campaigning in that he is increasingly unpopular and his wealth is very otherworldly to most Americans,\" G. Elliott Morris, former director of 538 for ABC News, said. Democratic strategist Christy Setzer pointed to recent protests and strong special election results as signs of rising Democratic momentum. Setzer sees Musk as a powerful symbol for Democrats to rally against, particularly if they tie him directly to Trump, framing both as a unified threat. \"There's a clear and obvious upside in going after Musk\u2014just ask the Wisconsin electorate, who showed him the door in dramatic fashion just last week,\" Setzer said. Indeed, in Wisconsin's recent Supreme Court election, the Democrats framed their victory as a repudiation of Musk. Following their success, DNC Chair Ken Martin issued a statement criticizing both Trump and Musk for undermining key social programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, all in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. He also blamed their economic policies\u2014especially the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u2014for eroding consumer confidence and fueling fears of a recession. On a recent episode of the Hacks On Tap podcast, former Obama-era adviser David Axelrod characterized the recent Wisconsin election as \"a referendum on Elon Musk,\" not Trump. \"Democrats see it as more fruitful to go after Musk,\" Axelrod explained.

Scott Olson/Getty Images However, Gift warned that while Musk and DOGE's declining popularity could energize the Democratic base, the party still needs a compelling, positive agenda to make significant inroads. \"Democrats still need a positive message about what they stand for. Like in November's election, simply running against Trump or against Musk won't be enough for Democrats to make the kind of gains in the House and Senate they hope for in 2026.\" Morris echoed this caution, noting that it is unlikely to repair the party's credibility on key issues such as crime, inflation, and trade, where voters still express skepticism. \"I do not think the backlash to him alone will be enough to repair the party's credibility where it was before [Joe] Biden took office,\" Morris told Newsweek . \"Americans tell pollsters they do not trust Democrats to handle crime, the economy, inflation, guns, trade, etc. Just fighting against Musk will not fix all of those problems for them.\" In order to retake the House and the Senate in the 2026 midterms, the Democrats face an uphill battle. Since Trump won against his opponent Kamala Harris , the Democratic Party has seen record-low approval ratings. According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990. There was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Some recent polls have also shown that Trump's approval rating among Democrats is actually rising, indicating that some voters may be less hostile to him than in the past. In a recent interview on Real Time with Bill Mahe r, California Governor Gavin Newsom described his party's brand as \"toxic.\" \"Democrats, we tend to be a little more judgmental than we should be,\" Newsom added. \"We need to own our mistakes. We need to own what's wrong with our party.\" But Setzer argued that her party's popularity has declined because it has been weak in the face of Trump\u2014something that has frustrated voters. \"Democrats aren't standing up strongly against the biggest threat to our economy and our democracy in history,\" she told Newsweek . Looking ahead to the 2026 midterms, Setzer argues that if Democrats want to use the unpopularity of figures like Musk as part of their campaign, they must connect that negative image directly to Trump. By doing so, they can use the public's dislike of Musk to also weaken the president's support. Setzer believes this strategy\u2014attacking both at the same time\u2014can help diminish Trump's power and mobilize voters against him. \"Democrats, r anyone who wishes to stop Trump, need to make sure they're tying Musk's toxicity to Trump and taking him down in the process,\" Setzer said. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

By Reuters | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:19 IST Photo Credit: Reuters Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015 Highlights Musk sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman last year He accused OpenAI of straying from its founding mission OpenAI was founded to develop AI for the good for humanity Advertisement A dozen former OpenAI employees filed a legal brief on Friday backing co-founder Elon Musk's lawsuit aimed at keeping the non-profit status of OpenAI, marking the latest development in the dispute over the future of the artificial intelligence firm. Corporate leaders want to give investors control, drawing a host of concerns and a lawsuit from Musk and others who say business interests must be subordinated to humanitarian goals. Last year, Musk , who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman , accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission - to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations. ChatGPT Can Now Remember and Reference Your Previous Conversations In their federal court filing on Friday, the former employees contended that stripping the nonprofit of its controlling role would \"fundamentally violate\" its mission, as it would lose oversight of the for-profit AI development entity. The former OpenAI employees, who said they held technical and leadership roles in the company, said the nonprofit's oversight was crucial to its overall strategy, and that while they worked at the firm, OpenAI executives had emphasised repeatedly the structure's importance in OpenAI's ability to execute on its mission. The structure also helped with recruitment, and many employees joined because they were inspired by the nonprofit's mission, they said. OpenAI has argued that it needs to remove the nonprofit's controlling role in order to raise funds from investors. The nonprofit will retain a stake in OpenAI that will become increasingly valuable as the company grows, enriching the nonprofit with deep resources to carry out its mission, the company argues. OpenAI Could Buy Jony Ive and Sam Altman\u2019s AI Devices Startup In a statement, OpenAI said the transition would not affect its mission: \u201cOur Board has been very clear: our nonprofit isn't going anywhere and our mission will remain the same.\u201d Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Musk's opposition to the change in structure led to the current suit, and the two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. Recently Musk also went on to create his own AI firm, xAI , in 2023, and Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor. OpenAI, meanwhile, faces pressure from investors to change its structure. In order for OpenAI to secure a $40 billion (roughly Rs. 3,44,386 crore) fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

(AFP via Getty Images, left, and AP file images) By Douglas Schoen PUBLISHED: April 14, 2025 at 3:17 AM EDT The very public \u2013 and often sophomoric\u2013 fights emerging within President Trump\u2019s inner circle have exposed the many different factions desperately competing for Trump\u2019s ear. The two spats \u2013 one between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro and the other between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2013 burst into the public\u2019s view this week as chaos over Trump\u2019s trade policy unnerved markets and business leaders. Ultimately, these fights have immense consequences for the future of Trump\u2019s term. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attempted to brush the issue aside, saying, \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d but the emerging fissures go deeper than mere disagreements over tariff policies. They are symbolic of a proxy war between the longtime MAGA loyalists and the more recent, often more practical \u2013 or less extreme \u2013 supporters. The former are represented by committed ideologues like Navarro, Lutnick and Steve Bannon, who have long pushed Trump to adopt more hardline policies. At the same time, the latter, represented by Musk and other tech and finance titans like Bill Ackman are less idealistic, having backed Trump hoping he would usher in economic prosperity and take a more centrist, common-sense approach to social and cultural issues. Of the two conflicts, the one between Musk and Navarro has been the most public, largely taking place on Musk\u2019s X platform. After Musk took to X to push back against heavy-handed tariffs, Navarro went on CNBC and derided Musk\u2019s Tesla as a simple \u201ccar assembler\u201d rather than an actual \u201ccar manufacturer.\u201d Navarro then insinuated that Tesla\u2019s manufacturing process undermines Trump\u2019s preference for American-made cars, clearly striking a nerve with the world\u2019s richest man and most visible Trump supporter. Musk responded by saying Navarro is \u201ctruly a moron,\u201d accused him of spreading false information, referred to Navarro as \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Plainly, opinions of Musk aside, his position on trade and tariffs is the correct one. Where he believes in truly free trade and understands the benefits of increased global trade, Navarro has been the administration\u2019s loudest champion of protectionist tariffs that would strangle American businesses, bring global trade to a halt, and likely cause a recession. Put another way, Trump would be wise to pay greater attention to the segment of Trump\u2019s coalition that Musk represents \u2013 practical, libertarian, and committed to American dominance of the future industries that will shape the global economy \u2013 than the more extreme, isolationist wing led by Navarro. The other fight within the administration, between Bessent and Lutnick, has not been nearly as public, but it may be even more important for the American economy. Indeed, Bessent has reportedly been advising Trump that tariffs must be a negotiating tactic, rather than a permanent policy, including flying to Florida to push the president to soften his tone. According to Politico , Bessent \u201ctold Trump that markets would remain in peril unless he started putting more emphasis\u201d on the endgame of tariffs \u2013 new trade deals \u2013 and stopped talk of the \u201cpain\u201d Americans would have to endure in a protracted trade war. Bessent\u2019s approach is in direct conflict with Lutnick, who has made regular media appearances stressing that high tariffs are permanent, including telling CNN , Trump is \u201cnot going to back off on tariffs.\u201d Lutnick\u2019s tenure has been marked by these sorts of gaffes. During a CNBC interview on Wednesday, he credited Trump\u2019s policies for the historic surge in the stock market, seemingly oblivious that it was entirely due to Trump doing the very thing Lutnick pledged he wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 backing off on tariffs. On the trade issue, it appears that the Bessent-Musk wing won out, for now at least. The 90-day pause Trump announced on Wednesday may not be a guarantee of no future trade war, but it does give time to negotiate the kind of deals Bessent has advocated for, while suspending the suffocating tariffs pushed by Navarro. Undoubtedly, that policy is the correct one. Had the initial tariffs remained in force for months, the U.S. almost inevitably would have entered a recession. To be sure, these divisions are not new. They have been simmering since even before the inauguration. Last December, the cracks in Trump\u2019s coalition first emerged over the issue of H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. Musk was again leading one side, arguing that these workers allowed American tech companies to maintain their global advantage. The other side, led by Bannon and Laura Loomer, fiercely pushed back, claiming that these migrants \u2013 mostly from India \u2013 were taking jobs away from Americans. Trump eventually came down on Musk\u2019s side, ending that fight, but not the overarching issue of courting a coalition with wildly different \u2013 and often contradictory \u2013 views. For example, Loomer is now apparently back in Trump\u2019s good graces, reportedly being behind the firing of multiple national security officials for supposed \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to the president. Nobody should be under any illusion that the infighting will stop anytime soon. It is a feature of Trump administrations, not an anomaly. Perhaps more than any other president, Trump thrives on playing off his advisor\u2019s diverging views. However, it is clear that if Trump wants to have a successful second term, help Republicans maintain both chambers of Congress, and safeguard his own political legacy, he should lean on the more reserved, professional, and less ideological wing of his coalition. Allowing the extreme, MAGA-loyalists to drive the administration\u2019s policies not only risks wrecking the American economy, but on a wider scale, it risks undermining the Republican Party for years to come.

Supplied The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in use in Cambodia is expected to rise significantly by the end of this year, with a BYD assembly plant scheduled to begin turning out new vehicles in late 2025. During an April 10 meeting between the leadership of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) and a delegation from BYD Auto Industry Co., Ltd., Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the CDC, expressed his appreciation to BYD\u2019s leadership for choosing Cambodia as the location for another assembly plant in the Southeast Asian region. The BYD delegation was led by Xiao Haiping, executive director of the BYD Group President\u2019s Office, who confirmed that the plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of next year. Chanthol explained that, as the Royal Government\u2019s one-stop service body, the CDC is always ready to facilitate and coordinate all private sector investment activities in Cambodia to ensure a favourable, flexible and beneficial investment climate. He also noted that the trend of using BYD cars in Cambodia is on the rise. \u201cOnce the electric vehicle assembly plant is completed and officially begins operations in the fourth quarter of 2025, the usage rate of BYD vehicles in Cambodia is expected to increase even further,\u201d he added. According to BYD executives, a groundbreaking ceremony for the assembly plant is scheduled for the end of April. The BYD assembly plant will be located in the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, which offers convenient transportation access for various components. The plant will involve an investment of over $30 million and is expected to have a production capacity of 10,000 vehicles per year. Recently, BYD also introduced new vehicle models into the Cambodian market, such as the BYD SEALION 5 and BYD ATTO 2, which it described as \u201cnot only high quality and equipped with advanced technology, but also highly fuel-efficient and affordably priced for the Cambodian market\u201d. In June 2024, Prime Minister Hun Manet declared BYD\u2019s establishment of an assembly plant in Cambodia as a major success for the Royal Government\u2019s efforts to attract international investors to the Kingdom. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport recently reported that the number of registered EVs in Cambodia has increased significantly. In 2024, a total of 2,253 EVs were registered \u2014 a 620% increase over 2023, when only 313 new EVs were registered. The report showed that the most popular EV brands in Cambodia are BYD, Toyota and Tesla. Currently, there are six car assembly plants operating in Cambodia, including those for Ford, SsangYong, Hyundai, Kia, GTV and Toyota. latest news Economist: No need for concern over Cambodia\u2019s 90% Chinese trade deficit Drug awareness campaign stepped up during New Year festivities BYD assembly plant to begin Cambodian operations by end of year Fire destroys two motorboats in Kampot province Marigolds bloom for New Year at Tbong Khmum provincial festival Wing Bank Eliminates Cash-Out Fees, Forgoes Millions to Advance Financial Inclusion Rubber exports down as domestic demand increases Gasoline, diesel prices drop by 150 riel Cambodia\u2019s international Q1 trade surged 15% year-on-year Record-setting bridge opens to public for KNY Must Watch More Videos \u276f Shots fired!

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Balmer meticulously planned the assault, using Molotov cocktails and a hammer, intending harm. The attack caused severe damage to the historic residence, symbolizing the erosion of democratic norms. Bipartisan backlash condemned the violence, though media double standards on political violence persist. The incident highlights a broader crisis where extremism replaces democratic discourse with brute force. In the predawn hours of April 13, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, his wife Lori, their four children, and guests were jolted awake by state troopers banging on their door. An arsonist had just firebombed their Harrisburg residence, hurling homemade explosives through shattered windows in what authorities called a \"targeted\" act of terrorism. The suspect, Cody Balmer, 38\u2014who later admitted to \"harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro\u2014turned himself in after confessing he would have assaulted the governor with a hammer if confronted. This brazen attack underscores a chilling trend: the erosion of democratic norms as political violence becomes alarmingly routine in America. A premeditated assault on democracy Balmer\u2019s meticulously planned attack reads like a domestic terrorism manual. According to Pennsylvania State Police affidavits, he siphoned gasoline from a lawnmower, filled Heineken bottles to create Molotov cocktails, and walked an hour to the governor\u2019s mansion. Surveillance footage captured him scaling a perimeter fence, smashing windows with a hammer, and igniting fires in the piano and dining rooms\u2014spaces where Shapiro\u2019s family had hosted a Passover Seder hours earlier. \"He was very methodical in his approach,\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens. Balmer\u2019s admission that he anticipated harming occupants reveals intent beyond property damage; this was an attempted political assassination. The damage was severe : ceilings collapsed, furniture was reduced to ash, and Passover decorations lay blackened beside shattered glass. Yet the greater devastation is symbolic. The governor\u2019s residence\u2014a historic building housing state art and eight gubernatorial families since 1968\u2014was violated not by a random criminal, but by a man weaponizing ideological rage. The backlash was swift and cross-partisan. Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman called the attack \"unacceptable,\" emphasizing, \"There is no place for violence in our society.\" Shapiro, a Democrat, echoed this: \"I don\u2019t give a damn if it\u2019s coming from one particular side or the other \u2026 It has to stop.\" Such solidarity is critical, yet it raises uncomfortable questions. Would national media devote equal coverage if a Republican governor were targeted? Recent history suggests not. When a left-wing activist shot GOP Congressman Steve Scalise in 2017 or when Trump supporters faced violent riots in 2020, many outlets downplayed the ideological motives. This double standard fuels division. As Shapiro noted, violent rhetoric\u2014whether from fringe online forums or mainstream commentators\u2014creates a permission structure for extremists. Balmer\u2019s actions didn\u2019t emerge in a vacuum. They reflect a culture where dehumanizing political opponents has become routine. The broader crisis: Violence as political language The Shapiro attack joins a grim roster: with the 2017 shooting of Rep. Scalise joined by last year\u2019s assassination attempts against Donald Trump and the ongoing burning and firebombing of Tesla vehicles. The common thread? A rejection of democratic resolution in favor of brute force. Balmer\u2019s use of improvised explosives mirrors tactics seen in extremist playbooks, yet his profile\u2014a Harrisburg local with prior theft charges\u2014defies easy categorization. This unpredictability makes such threats harder to combat. Critically, Balmer\u2019s hatred wasn\u2019t abstract. He told police he knew Shapiro might be home, accepting the risk of casualties. This distinguishes the act from mere vandalism; it was terrorism designed to intimidate a sitting official and his constituents. Authorities charged Balmer with eight felonies, including terrorism and attempted murder. Yet legal consequences alone won\u2019t remedy the societal sickness enabling such violence. Shapiro\u2019s refusal to be \"deterred\" is commendable, but his call for unity must be matched by systemic action: bolstering security for officials, de-escalating incendiary rhetoric, and rejecting partisan hypocrisy in condemning attacks. The fire at the governor\u2019s mansion is a flare illuminating America\u2019s crisis of civility. When ideology justifies arson against elected leaders, democracy itself burns. As Shapiro said amidst the ashes: \"We have to be better than this.\" Sources for this article include: 100PercentFedUp.com Fox43.com CNN.com FoxNews.com Related Topics antifa arson bias chaos Dangerous domestic terrorism insanity Josh Shapiro left cult political violence rioting Latest News 04/14/2025 / By Willow Tohi DOJ launches Second Amendment Task Force amid federal rollback of gun control measures 04/14/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Housing market panic escalates: A perfect storm of tariff fears, inflation, high interest rates, and historic unaffordability 04/14/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Father speaks out: Challenging the mainstream narrative of his daughter\u2019s \u201cunvaccinated measles death\u201d 04/14/2025 / By Willow Tohi Convenience culture\u2019s hidden toll: Study links ultra-processed foods to reduced lifespan and environmental harm 04/14/2025 / By Laura Harris Trump administration proposes $998 daily fines on migrants defying deportation orders 04/14/2025 / By Ava Grace RFK Jr. launches federal probe into autism surge, vows answers by 2025 Related News 03/24/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Bernie Sanders, \u201canti-oligarchy rally\u201d exposed as staged spectacle with bussed-in activists tied to antifa, pro-hamas networks 03/24/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Tesla, Elon Musk targeted by same useful idiot domestic terrorists that burned and pillaged American cities in 2020 03/23/2025 / By Willow Tohi EXPOSED: Antifa and IRS collude to shield radical funding from taxation 03/10/2025 / By S.D.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Sam Altman, a dad and OpenAI's CEO, loves one smart crib for his baby son. His top baby gear picks so far are Cradlewise's crib and lots of burp cloths. At $1,999, Cradlewise is pricer than the Snoo \u2014 but it can be used for longer. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, is deep in new-dad life \u2014 and he's already sharing strong opinions on baby gear. \"We bought a lot of silly baby things that we haven't needed,\" he posted on X on Sunday night. \"But definitely I recommend a Cradlewise crib and a lot more burp rags than you think you could possibly need.\" Cradlewise hasn't made as many headlines as its older and bigger competitor, the Snoo \u2014 the sleek, motorized bassinet that's basically the Tesla of baby tech . The Snoo , designed by celebrity pediatrician Harvey Karp, has been the go-to setup for sleep-deprived parents for nearly a decade. It uses motion, white noise, and a built-in swaddle to gently rock babies back to sleep. Retailing at $1,695, or $159 a month to rent, the Snoo has amassed a devoted fan base, including celebrity parents like Justin Timberlake and Zoe Salda\u00f1a , who invested in the company. Altman's pick, Cradlewise, works a little differently \u2014 and at nearly $2,000, it's the pricier option. Instead of waiting for cries, it bounces the baby gently up and down to preempt fussing. It also skips the built-in swaddle, one of Snoo's signature features, and includes a built-in baby monitor and music features. Parents can use Cradlewise's crib for longer with a growing baby. The Snoo tops out at around six months old. Cradlewise converts from bassinet to crib, so it can be used until the baby turns two years old or meets other milestones, like weight. \"We're so grateful to Sam Altman for choosing Cradlewise for their baby,\" Radhika Patil, the CEO and cofounder of Cradlewise, told Business Insider. \"It means a lot coming from someone who truly understands the power of good tech.\" Snoo did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. 'Having a kid changed a lot of things' Altman and his husband, software engineer Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their baby boy in February . The newborn came early and spent some time in the neonatal intensive care unit.

It still feels a little paranoid to say it out loud: that the United States might be drifting toward something that looks a lot like Russia. Or Hungary. Or some unholy blend of theocratic nostalgia and corporate feudalism. But that gut feeling\u2014the one that says something\u2019s not right\u2014is getting harder to shake. The signs aren\u2019t exactly subtle, either. To anyone paying attention, they\u2019re plenty loud. But they\u2019re also easy to tune out, easy to dismiss as noise, as politics as usual. What\u2019s harder to ignore are the rituals. The reverence. The worship. The way power starts to look like something owed. We don\u2019t usually start naming highways after sitting presidents\u2014especially ones under multiple indictments, most especially ones wildly obsessed with power and openly musing about a third term. But here we are. A bill in Texas proposes to rename a stretch of I-35 the \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump Highway.\u201d It may not even pass, but that almost doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s one of a growing list of gestures aimed at deifying a man who, by any rational standard, should be facing serious consequences for his role in the January 6th insurrection\u2014an attack on the peaceful transfer of power that many legal scholars argue should disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment , if not result in criminal charges for inciting sedition. Instead, we get a slow-motion canonization. Lawmakers have floated putting Trump\u2019s face on currency, making his birthday a federal holiday, and renaming airports in his honor . Some supporters even want to carve his likeness into Mount Rushmore. Religious leaders compare him to biblical kings \u2014chosen vessels, sent by God. This isn\u2019t politics anymore. It\u2019s mythology. It\u2019s the construction of a parallel reality where Trump isn\u2019t just a man, but a savior figure. The kind of figure who can do no wrong, whose followers speak of him in reverent tones, who must be protected at all costs. This is how democratic values rot\u2014not all at once, but through the slow normalization of idolatry disguised as patriotism. But mythology only works if it can crowd out reality. Repression needs scaffolding\u2014and no tool is more effective than confusion. The Trump administration doesn\u2019t just clash with the press; it undermines the very concept of truth. \u201cFake news\u201d isn\u2019t a throwaway insult anymore\u2014it\u2019s a strategy. A sustained campaign to flood the information space and make facts feel optional. Reporters who challenge the administration are smeared as traitors or \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives. Trump still calls mainstream journalists \u201c the enemy of the people, \u201d echoing the language of the dictators and strongmen he seems to admire so much. Investigations are dismissed as partisan attacks. Whistleblowers are discredited before they speak. Independent newsrooms face lawsuits, threats, and coordinated disinformation campaigns designed to corrode public trust. And it works. The more chaotic the noise, the easier it is to tune out the signal. Truth becomes something to argue about, not act on. And once reality gets slippery, everything else is easier to break. Books get banned. Curricula get sanitized. Judges face harassment for upholding the law. Ordinary people start second-guessing what they post, what they share, what they say out loud. It doesn\u2019t take long for folks to forget what used to be obvious: opposition to authoritarianism is essential to a free society. *** I live in Austin, Texas, a city that prides itself on being an outlier inside a state that loves to talk about freedom while quietly legislating the opposite. This is a state where \u201csmall government\u201d somehow includes sweeping preemption laws, micromanaging what books kids can read, and controlling uteruses. The message is clear: freedom is fine\u2014as long as it\u2019s defined by those in power. Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country \u2014providers can face life in prison, and even individuals assisting in abortion access risk legal consequences, even in cases of rape or incest. In public schools, Bible-based curricula are slipping into classrooms under the name of \u201cvalues\u201d or \u201cpatriotism,\u201d incentivized by lawmakers. It\u2019s not freedom\u2014it\u2019s state-mandated morality dressed up as tradition. There\u2019s a reflex in this country\u2014maybe in every country\u2014to label dissent as disloyalty. Criticize the government, and suddenly you\u2019re \u201canti-American.\u201d I don\u2019t buy that. I love this country and the ideals it\u2019s supposed to stand for. When I enlisted in the Army and volunteered for the infantry, I swore an oath. I\u2019ve seen firsthand what it means to put your body on the line for a set of principles. Sure, my war was Iraq. And in hindsight, it\u2019s clear we weren\u2019t exactly defending American freedoms by invading a nation that had nothing to do with 9/11. But the men I served with\u2014some of whom never came home\u2014weren\u2019t there for oil or politics. They were there because they believed in service. Many had volunteered in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, willing to risk their lives to protect something bigger than themselves. They believed in the promise of liberty, accountability, and a system worth defending. And some of them probably support President Trump. I don\u2019t speak for them\u2014and while I respect their right to that choice, I won\u2019t pretend to understand it. But I do know what we all swore to uphold. Our oath wasn\u2019t to a man, or a party, or even a flag. It was to a Constitution\u2014one that\u2019s supposed to hold this nation together. (1) That\u2019s why this matters to me. When I see politicians twisting those principles into tools of repression, I don\u2019t call it patriotism. I call it what it is: a threat. And while there are many faces to that threat, perhaps none illustrates it more clearly right now than Elon Musk\u2014a man elected by no one, yet handed more control over federal institutions than most cabinet secretaries. His financial influence didn\u2019t just buy him a seat at the table. It bought him the table. *** Elon Musk\u2014billionaire, attention addict, CEO of everything\u2014holds real political power now. Not metaphorically, not just influence-by-Twitter (or X, or whatever that ad-choked echo chamber is calling itself today). Trump brought him in early to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency\u2014DOGE, which sounds like a joke until you realize it\u2019s not. As a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d Musk was handed sweeping authority to cancel contracts, slash programs, and restructure entire federal agencies. No election. No confirmation. No accountability\u2014except to Trump and his inner circle. Musk has used that power like a wrecking ball. USAID, gutted. The CFPB, gutted. The VA, slashed. Now the Department of Education is on the chopping block\u2014literally. Trump already signed the executive order to begin dismantling it, with the justification that schools should be governed \u201clocally.\u201d But the fallout is anything but local. Teachers\u2019 unions, the NAACP, and civil rights organizations are suing , warning that the move violates the Constitution and threatens to gut federal protections for vulnerable students. Meanwhile, DOGE\u2019s attempts to access sensitive agency data have been blocked by federal courts, citing privacy concerns and executive overreach. And like clockwork, Musk\u2019s signature chaos-management style has followed him into government: mass firings with little discernment, followed by quiet attempts to rehire the very people dismissed \u2014nuclear safety experts, pandemic response staff, oversight personnel\u2014when it turns out gutting institutions has consequences. Even Musk\u2019s own support is starting to wobble. His approval numbers have slipped. Protests have spread. Tesla cars have been vandalized, and a whole side hustle economy has popped up to cash in \u2014selling bumper stickers to owners who bought the car before they realized what kind of guy came with it. Movements like \u201c Tesla Takedown ,\u201d built around public shaming and targeted boycotts of Musk\u2019s brands, are picking up steam. Trump\u2019s base still defends him, mostly\u2014but they\u2019re beginning to sour on Musk. The golden boy of techno-libertarianism now looks a lot more like a self-dealing billionaire with too much control over their lives. Musk\u2019s role in the administration isn\u2019t just a weird twist of the Trump saga. It\u2019s a symptom of something much deeper: the corrosion of democratic norms in real time. When unelected billionaires are empowered to disassemble the federal government and profit from the fallout , we\u2019re not looking at innovation. We\u2019re looking at privatized power in patriotic packaging. Legal scholars are already sounding the alarm about a coming constitutional crisis. The rule of law is being selectively applied, courts are being ignored or sidelined, and the balance of power is being bent toward executive fiat. If the Constitution is a framework built on checks and balances, then we\u2019re watching those supports be quietly removed, one by one. This isn\u2019t hypothetical. It\u2019s happening. And if it continues unchecked, we\u2019re not just flirting with autocracy \u2014we\u2019re laying out a red carpet for it. And it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum. The courts have been methodically reengineered. Three Supreme Court justices were installed during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014after he lost the popular vote\u2014with help from a Senate that represents a minority of Americans. Lower courts have been stacked with ideologues who don\u2019t hide their contempt for civil rights. And then there are the laws\u2014quietly passed, easily overlooked\u2014that encourage citizens to snitch , sue, or surveil each other under the guise of morality or tradition. It\u2019s not just policy anymore; it\u2019s a culture shift. A moral panic turned into legislation. *** None of this is new. We\u2019ve seen this playbook before. Germany in the 1930s didn\u2019t collapse overnight. It slid\u2014through legal channels, institutional decay, and the slow boiling of norms. Russia didn\u2019t need a coup; it had bureaucracy, media control, and just enough plausible deniability. Hungary rewrote its constitution and wrapped its authoritarianism in flags and hymns. The slogans vary\u2014family, faith, purity, tradition\u2014but the structure is the same: consolidate power, erode checks, rebrand repression as righteousness. Here, it\u2019s not boots in the street\u2014it\u2019s bans in the library. It\u2019s teachers rewriting syllabi out of fear. It\u2019s protesters labeled extremists, and voting rights treated like optional extras. The message isn\u2019t \u201cyou can\u2019t speak.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s the whisper before the silence. I\u2019m not a paranoid person. I have no patience for conspiracy freaks or tinfoil logic. I try to root my thinking in science and history\u2014in what can be known, what can be verified. But even so, I\u2019m not immune to the quiet worries that slip through the cracks. I\u2019m writing this on a device connected to the internet. Nothing is truly private. Nothing online ever really disappears. That\u2019s not a problem with this essay\u2014I plan to publish it. But what about private messages? Notes? Conversations with AI? Whether we like it or not, tools like ChatGPT are becoming fixtures in daily life. People use them to draft emails, unpack personal dilemmas, or ask the kinds of questions they\u2019re not ready to say out loud. But these aren\u2019t confidants. They\u2019re algorithms trained to guess the next likely word. No mind, no morals, no memory. Are they logging dissent? Mapping behavior? Storing keywords for some future review? Maybe not. Or maybe not yet. But let\u2019s not underestimate the creativity of bad actors with power. The infrastructure exists. And if the political winds shift hard enough, all it takes is a flip of a switch. When it comes to tech abuse, the current administration\u2019s incompetence might actually be our last line of defense. These are, after all, the same people who planned a military strike in a Signal group chat\u2014and accidentally invited a journalist. If Orwell wrote fiction, these guys are writing farce. Jokes aside, the surveillance state doesn\u2019t need to be competent\u2014just connected. Metadata is already vacuumed up. GPS logs, browsing habits, biometric patterns\u2014all cross-referenced with identities. If this all sounds like dystopian fiction, that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve been trained to think of it that way. But it\u2019s not fiction. The systems are real. The only thing missing is the right justification: National security. Public order. \u201cFamily values.\u201d \u201cProtecting the children.\u201d And then comes the refrain: If you\u2019ve got nothing to hide, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear. That\u2019s how it always starts. *** The threat isn\u2019t abstract anymore. It\u2019s not looming\u2014it\u2019s embedded. Not with jackboots and batons\u2014though keep going down this road and we\u2019ll get there\u2014but with procedural language and patriotic branding. It waits for fatigue to set in. For outrage to give way to apathy. For protest to feel futile, and speaking up to feel like a risk. We\u2019ve been conditioned to treat comparisons to fascism as melodramatic. Alarmist. But sometimes, alarmist just means paying attention. When journalists are attacked, when courts are captured, when books are pulled from shelves and history is rewritten in real time, it\u2019s not alarmist to say the house is on fire. It\u2019s responsible. Authoritarianism doesn\u2019t need everyone to go silent\u2014just enough people afraid of making noise. It thrives on hesitation. On people weighing the cost of resistance against the ease of going along. That\u2019s the most dangerous part\u2014not the censorship itself, but the internalized version. The self-editing. The second-guessing. The voice that says: Maybe just let it go. Maybe don\u2019t post that. Maybe don\u2019t write this. But I\u2019d rather name it now than whisper about it later. If this country is still salvageable\u2014and I believe it is\u2014it won\u2019t be because we waited politely. It\u2019ll be because enough people chose not to. Because silence isn\u2019t safety. It\u2019s surrender in slow motion. *** To Those Who Still Support President Trump Maybe you still support Donald Trump and his approach to governing. A lot of people clearly do. Or maybe you just choose to look the other way. Either way, ask yourself this: what happens when the next president isn\u2019t your guy? When someone you don\u2019t trust\u2014someone you don\u2019t like and didn\u2019t vote for\u2014inherits the same unchecked authority, the same gutted institutions, the same executive branch reshaped for loyalty over law? To be fair, this didn\u2019t start with Trump. The power of the presidency has been sliding in this direction for decades. But he sure as hell didn\u2019t slow it down\u2014he stepped on the gas. And that\u2019s the thing about power: once it expands, it rarely contracts. The people who come next don\u2019t give it back\u2014they just find new ways to use it\u2026 to abuse it. The Founders weren\u2019t perfect, but they knew what concentrated power could do. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t build a throne\u2014they built limits. Guardrails. And we\u2019re watching those get stripped for parts. You might like who\u2019s driving now. But what happens when you don\u2019t?

That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

You can\u2019t exactly blame mega-cap stocks because Donald Trump felt like stirring the market pot, but tech stock oscillations \u2013 on Wednesday, following dizzying declines, Tesla , Nvidia and Apple soared 22.7, 18.7 and 15.3 per cent, respectively \u2013 are having an outsized impact on indices. Much attention has focused on the mag seven\u2019s growing influence on index returns, given they account for 30 per cent of the S&P 500\u2032s market capitalisation and 17 per cent of the MSCI All-Cap World Index\u2019s (ACWI).

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft. So if your portfolio\u2019s giving you indigestion, check the label \u2013 it probably says Nvidia.

However, it\u2019d be even better if Elon focused more on striking closer to the root of the problem: the public\u2019s economic ignorance from which all the disastrous, coercive, competition-immune, monopolistic government central planning, spending, and also warmongering grows. This is precisely what Ludwig von Mises did, and I like to call it the \u201cMisesian formula\u201d for prosperity. Mises devoted parts of his majestic treatise Human Action (1949) to the formula. In a section aptly titled \u201cEconomics and the Citizen,\u201d Mises writes : 5-Minute Core Exercise... Dzenitis, Tami Brehse Best Price: $3.81 Buy New $8.68 (as of 03:36 UTC - Details ) Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man\u2019s human existence\u2026. All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of\u2026economics. Everybody\u2019s mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines\u2026. Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories\u2026. As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake\u2026. \u2026all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society\u2019s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen. Since it\u2019s real freedom and capitalism that lead to prosperity, explaining this to people is, per Mises, \u201c the primary civic duty .\u201d Riding the wave of economic education, Javier Milei had been spearheading on his way to electoral triumph in Argentina, on November 8, 2023 Elon tweeted a Hayek meme writing: \u201cBest economist ever.\u201d A week later, on December 4, he tweeted , \u201cGreat book by Hayek\u201d while linking to Hayek\u2019s classic book The Road To Serfdom , and another meme quoting Hayek : \u201cnothing could contribute more to the cure of humanity\u2019s ills than to give people a better understanding of economics .\u201d Elon is thus increasingly aware of the need to educate, but still far from having a Misesian ethos-understanding. Mankind\u2019s problems are overwhelmingly the result of the public\u2019s economic ignorance which then, via democracy, manifests itself in the order-destroying bureaucracies. It is their ignorance\u2014that of your neighbor, family members, and likely former self\u2014that is near the root of the problem, not whatever homo sapiens people vote for. The very root of this economic ignorance, as significantly shown by founder of the \u201cAustrian School of Economics,\u201d Carl Menger, is the fact that money (and its vital emerging benefits like profit-loss calculation), trade, the division of labor, economic competition, etc. are\u2014to borrow Adam Ferguson\u2019s popular phrase \u2014\u201cindeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.\u201d Hardly anyone, and much less people of significant influence, likely including Elon, are aware of this. One of my favorite little-known Libertarian books is Walter Block\u2019s I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians , which contains over 80 autobiographical essays-interviews of leading libertarians/free marketeers like Walter himself, Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, Peter Boettke, etc., describing how they became libertarians/free marketeers. It is easy to see how many of them went from being ignorant big government, socialist myth-believers to champions of freedom and emerging civilization, by stumbling upon sound economics. Mises (1881-1973) died long before the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) and pro-capitalist reforms in China, thus he spent his lifetime fighting a losing intellectual battle, as socialist myths expanded their control of more countries. He writes : From time to time I entertained the hope that my writings would bear practical fruit and point policy in the right direction. I have always looked for evidence of a change in ideology. But I never actually deceived myself; my theories explain, but cannot slow the decline of a great civilization. I set out to be a reformer, but only became the historian of decline. After WWI, he carried the same determination in his Atlas-like intellectual-educational efforts: How one carries on in the face of unavoidable catastrophe is a matter of temperament\u2026. Again and again I had met with situations from which rational deliberation found no means of escape; but then the unexpected intervened, and with it came salvation. I would not lose courage even now. I wanted to do everything an economist could do. I would not tire in saying what I knew to be true. Mises again , in Human Action : \u2026in the field of social organization and economic policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doctrines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such thing as an unpopular system of government\u2026. The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowledge. It determines the whole process of human history\u2026. \u2026great men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans if they do not convince public opinion. The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority. Mises\u2019s wisdom above predicts what is happening to Elon and his DOGE, and again highlights the need to \u201cconvince public opinion.\u201d Although Elon has gained support from many, a large percentage of the economically-ignorant public is increasingly, fanatically against Elon\u2019s efforts. Bolshevik-like, intellectually dangerous ideologues like Robert Reich have been constantly spewing anti-economics and violence-inducing class-warfare rhetoric. For example, on March 12, 2025, Reich wrote in Facebook: Elon Musk is trying to steal the federal government \u2014 slashing public services, firing civil servants, and handing power to billionaires like himself. I salute the brave public servants who are resisting this coup. This type of mindset by the economically ignorant masses have made Musk one of the most hated men in America, to be destroyed via lawfare and even physical violence. From January 29 to March 10, 2025, there have been 9 attacks on Tesla locations . On March 10, X/Twitter suffered a relatively massive outage which, at the time, Elon felt originated in Ukraine, showing the potential dangers of being against the interests of millions vested in neocon warfare. I would not be surprised if SpaceX and Tesla are already\u2014or will eventually be\u2014victims of internal sabotage. Statistically, as the anti-Elon dice keep getting rolled at an increasing rate, he will likely be brought down somehow. Besides, as Vincent Cook\u2019s article \u201c Is DOGE a Dog When It Comes to Real Federal Spending? \u201d shows, there are too many legal obligations for DOGE to make significant cuts. Elon is attacking the symptoms of economic ignorance, not the root causes like Mises did. With a more Misesian intellectual background and educational strategy, Javier Milei\u2014similar to Ron Paul\u2014managed to educate enough people to win the presidency of Argentina. In an interview with Ben Shapiro, Milei explained how the intellectual revolution grew from economic education: The Next Civil War: Di... Marche, Stephen Best Price: $10.12 Buy New $13.64 (as of 10:51 UTC - Details ) This time young people were really educated. We would organize what we called the concerts. They were political rallies\u2026 At these rallies we had stands\u2026with books. Minister Bullrich\u2026said something brilliant, \u201cyou should pay more attention to what Milei is doing. It\u2019s not normal for a politician to be talking to 20 or 30 thousand people about Hayek.\u201d Young people started to evangelize at home with their parents and grandparents. Mises wrote : Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority\u2026 It has full confidence in man\u2019s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future. In other words, we must believe that we can educate \u201cthe immense majority,\u201d and thus act accordingly, even if it proves to be futile, otherwise \u201cthere is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future.\u201d Mises concludes Human Action : The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the human race. Note : The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More A year before global markets were upended by President Trump's tariffs, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned shareholders of the rising threat of China's electric vehicle makers. In Tesla's Q4 earnings call on January 24, 2024, Mr Musk said: The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They are extremely good. I'm aware this story could go in many directions from here. But I'll focus on China's biggest EV maker, its rising dominance, and the implications for ASX lithium shares . Last week, I wrote a story that looked at whether or not the plunging lithium price had finally hit the bottom . A key factor that will determine where the price of lithium will go from here is demand, particularly Chinese demand. The latest Resources and Energy Quarterly report states that global lithium demand is forecast to grow by almost 13% a year to 2030. A closer look reveals forecasts of increased demand for lithium are largely based on expectations of increased uptake of electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. And BYD , which has now overtaken Tesla to become the biggest supplier of EVs in the world, will play a significant part in fuelling that demand. In 2024, more than 90% of Australia's lithium exports were shipped to China, and the Middle Kingdom's appetite for lithium shows no sign of slowing down. Chinese demand for lithium is set to rise as the biggest player in the EV space continues to expand despite tariff implications. In 2024, BYD reported that it had delivered 4.24 million vehicles, up from around 3 million the previous year. Charging ahead BYD is now selling almost as many vehicles as Ford, an astonishing feat for a company that has been around for only 30 years. This year, the company is projecting that it will deliver about 5.5 million EVs. It's likely that President Trump's tariffs will do little to slow BYD's rising dominance in the electric vehicle market. BYD's biggest market is China, where rising adoption rates of electric vehicles contributed to global EV sales growth of 26% last year. Other key markets for BYD include Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. And momentum is continuing into 2025 and beyond. Analysts at JPMorgan have raised their estimate for BYD's vehicle deliveries for 2026 to 6.5 million units. As BYD continues its astronomical growth path, it will have a material impact on global lithium demand. I'm not suggesting that all this means that the price of lithium has hit the floor. But it does seem clear that the signs do point to a more optimistic outlook for ASX-listed lithium players, including Pilbara Minerals Ltd ( ASX: PLS ), Minerals Resources Ltd ( ASX: MIN ), and Liontown Resources Ltd ( ASX: LTR ).

The Chinese government is drafting a new regulatory system for exports, and while the policies are being framed, the shipments of the magnets, essential for the manufacturing of almost everything ranging from cars to missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports, according to a report by The New York Times. Per the report, once the new regulatory system is in place, it could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors. US Dependency On Chinese Imports The official crackdown on exports is part of Beijing's retaliation against US President Trump's punishing trade war. China produces around 90 per cent of the world's rare earths, a group of 17 elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and electronics industries. Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related items, have been placed on the export control list. The United States has only one rare earths mine, and most of its supply comes from China. Beijing placed export restrictions on rare earth elements on April 2 as part of a broader package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump's decision to hike tariffs against most Chinese products to 54 per cent. The export curbs include not only mined minerals but permanent magnets and other finished products that will be difficult to replace, analysts said. The move, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further ratchets up trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and leaves American manufacturers scrambling for fresh supplies of the critical minerals they have relied upon for decades. Now, metals and special magnets made with them can only be shipped out of China with special export licenses, the NYT report said. However, Beijing's system to issue these licenses is barely in place, which is causing consternation among industry executives that the process could drag on and that current supplies of minerals and products outside of China could run low. A Move To Exert Dominance The move, which affects exports to all countries, not just the US, is the latest demonstration of China's ability to weaponize its dominance over the mining and processing of the critical minerals. While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, Beijing can throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it issues. Lockheed Martin, Tesla and Apple are among the US companies that use Chinese rare earths in their supply chains. The US government has stockpiles of some rare earths, but not enough to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity. Beijing has already imposed outright bans on the export of three metals to the US and slapped export controls on many others. The moves to restrict heavy rare earths are especially important because China has even tighter control over these elements, David Merriman at consultancy Project Blue, told Reuters. \"There is currently only one HREE (heavy rare earth element) focused operation outside of China, Myanmar and Laos,\" he said, adding that China has close involvement in supply chains from Myanmar and Laos. Why Rare Metals Are Important For The US The heavy rare earth metals put under export suspension by China are used in magnets-- essential for many kinds of electric motors used in the manufacturing of electric cars, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft and gasoline-powered cars. These metals are required for the manufacturing of jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs and capacitors, which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones.

The US and China remain mired in a seemingly never-ending bout of one-upmanship, characterized by tit-for-tat trade levies and strategic export bans, which, in the case of the US, revolve around semiconductors, while China has now flexed its own muscles by restricting the export of rare earth metals. In this highly volatile situation, a Tesla patent from 2023 could be the answer to the conundrum of de-risking America's supply chains, at least where rare earth metals are concerned.

Not the ones that produce the rare earth metals and nowhere near the amount the modern world needs to sustain itself Having an industry that can support the refinement of rare earths requires a massive amount of centralized planning and state policy investment into creating the\u2026 \u2014 Yakubian Thought and Theory (@Mind_of_yakub) April 14, 2025 For the benefit of those who might not be aware, rare earth metals are used in an entire gamut of industries, including in the production of magnets for electric motors. In contrast to the commonly held view, the US can't just start refining its own copious rare earth resources at the flip of a switch, for such a feat requires an intricate interplay of massive funding, energy, infrastructure, and vertically integrated supply chain partners. While the US can certainly establish its own rare earth domain, it would likely require the better part of a decade. Slitted Magnet for Selective Coercivity: Tesla's Novel Approach to Rare Earth Metal Reduction @Tesla 's WO2024097176A1 patent introduces an innovative magnet manufacturing technique that transforms electric vehicle motor production through strategic cavity-based doping. By\u2026 pic.twitter.com/tZcaJ03OPG \u2014 SETI Park (@seti_park) December 4, 2024 So, what's the solution in the interim? Well, one idea centers around significantly reducing the use of rare earth metals in key industrial processes, and Tesla might offer one such avenue worth pursuing. To wit, in a patent filed back in 2023, bearing the international publication number WO2024097176A1 , Tesla describes a 'keyhole surgery-like process' to significantly reduce the need for rare earth metals in the manufacturing process of electric motors. The process involves the creation of \"controlled-depth cavities (0.2-1.5mm wide) in magnet structure,\" which then allow for the introduction of specific dopants. According to the patent, the process achieves desired magnetic properties while significantly reducing rare earth metal usage and manufacturing complexity. Of course, it remains unclear if Tesla is using this approach in its gigafactories, and to what extent. However, the approach does stand out for its simplicity and, therefore, could constitute a viable avenue for de-risking America's intertwined supply chains.

The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump 's first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company's Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google's co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley's environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what's happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. Live Events \"One of the things I've seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\" Lyons said. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. \"I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\" said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry. \"The shift hasn't been for a lot of people,\" said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \"It's a handful of people who've gotten the attention.\" The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of the world's best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House 's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk . Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. \"We're still in the belly of the beast,\" said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \"If the lake was frozen, there's a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\" The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington's business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world's problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers' dreams of changing the world for the better. Google's motto was \"don't be evil,\" a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. \"Now,\" she said, \"if you're part of a startup, you're hoping you'll be absorbed in a way that's profitable.\" Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. \"I feel sick to my stomach now,\" she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. \"I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\" Sylvester said. \"It was not all OK.\" It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump's challenges to the country's system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley's top executives. \"The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\" said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \"Unfortunately, you've got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\" \"Just coming here, everyone's saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\" Wood added. \"We're all scared.\" Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. \"The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.\" Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition Asian Paints is trading at P/E lower than pandemic levels.

Cred is in early talks to raise new funds at a reduced valuation. This and more scoops in a packed edition of ETtech Morning Dispatch. Also in the letter: \u25a0 Bumrah\u2019s latest delivery \u25a0 India\u2019s tariff advantage \u25a0 K\u2019taka\u2019s gig welfare policy Scoop: Cred in talks to raise new funds as valuation slips by over 30% to $4 billion Credit card bill payments startup Cred has held discussions to pick up new funds at a lower valuation compared to its previous round, several people in the know said. Deal details: Existing backers, including Singaporean sovereign fund GIC, Peak XV Partners, Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, QED, among others are in discussions to invest $100-$200 million in Cred\u2019s latest financing, people in the know told us. The round could value Cred anywhere between $3.5-4 billion, a significant drop from its $6.4 billion valuation in 2022 . Valuation correction: If the round goes through, the Kunal Shah-led Cred may become one of the first major fintechs to raise venture funding at a markdown from its 2022 peak. Despite steady revenue growth and positive cash flow, sources said Cred\u2019s decision to pursue a down round reflects broader market realities. Between 2021 and 2022, the startup\u2019s valuation jumped from $3.4 billion to $6.4 billion in a year\u2019s time. Global fintech reset: Silicon Valley-based payments giant Stripe slashed its valuation from a 2021 peak of $95 billion to $50 billion last year . Earlier this year, Stripe disclosed that investors purchased employee shares through a tender offer at a $91.5 billion valuation. Swedish fintech firm Klarna saw its valuation plunge from $46 billion to $6.7 billion. Having delayed its IPO, Klarna now aims for a valuation above $15 billion when it eventually lists . Pushing growth: The fresh capital would help Cred accelerate growth across its business lines spanning lending, insurance, ecommerce and digital payments. Part of the funding may also bolster its lending arm, Newtap Finance, which aims to play a larger role in Cred's expanding financial services portfolio.

Funding woes: The company's monthly cash burn exceeds Rs 20 crore, prompting the decision to wind down its core operations. Earlier this year, a $50 million fundraising effort collapsed after existing investors refused to inject fresh capital. Financial troubles have deepened due to a debt crisis at Gensol Engineering, a firm backed by BluSmart founders Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. This has further constrained access to funds for the ride-hailing business. What else: Once BluSmart\u2019s vehicles are listed on Uber, the startup will receive a share of fare revenues while Uber retains its standard commission\u2014just as it does with other fleet operators or individual driver partners. Leadership exodus: Several senior BluSmart executives have recently stepped down, including fleet CEO Anirudh Arun, chief technology officer Rishabh Sood, and chief business officer Tushar Garg, formerly of Uber India.

Driving the news: Bumrah\u2019s move reflects a broader trend of celebrities looking beyond traditional brand endorsements to make business investments. In recent years, cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, and Hardik Pandya have increasingly invested in businesses or launched their own ventures. Investment details: Sudip Ghose, founder of Uppercase, revealed that the company will collaborate with Bumrah to develop a new line of products, including luggage, backpacks, and gym bags, designed primarily for athletes. Bumrah will receive a share of the profits from these items. Other happenings: Last week, former Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli ended his Rs 110 crore endorsement deal with Puma after eight years. He has now joined and invested in Agilitas, a Bengaluru-based sportswear manufacturing and athleisure startup founded by ex-Puma India managing director Abhishek Ganguly.

Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary: Electronics tariff exemptions are temporary, chip tariffs coming soon The goods will soon fall under a new semiconductor-specific tariff policy, likely within two months By AP- PTI Updated - April 14, 2025 at 07:33 AM. | Nashville US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The ongoing ambiguity has rattled markets, especially Big Tech firms like Apple and Nvidia, with experts warning of severe disruption to supply chains and investor confidence. | Photo Credit: NATHAN HOWARD/Reuters Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no \u201cexception\u201d at all because the goods are \u201cjust moving to a different\" bucket and will still face a 20 per cent tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren't usually made in the US The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won't be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. Also read Apple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India to beat Trump tariffs, sources say It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was \u201ctaking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Also read Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. Comments Published on April 14, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS. THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS.

Navarro is \"truly a moron\" and \"dumber than a sack of bricks,\" Musk posted to his X social platform last week during a spat over the American parts content in Tesla vehicles. He later dubbed the Trump advisor \"Peter Retarrdo\" in a separate post. \"I've been called worse. Everything's fine with Elon,\" Navarro told broadcaster NBC on Sunday. \"Elon is doing a very good job with his team with waste, fraud and abuse. That's a tremendous contribution to America,\" he added of Musk's aggressive cost-cutting through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Navarro had taken aim at Tesla after the billionaire Musk, who also owns SpaceX, proposed a free-trade zone between the US and Europe. The economist claimed Tesla mostly assembled components like batteries and motors shipped in from factories in Asia. Those are exactly the types of jobs Trump says his trade offensive is designed to bring back to America. Musk retorted with studies he said showed \"Tesla has the most American-made cars.\" \"Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,\" he added -- referring to a fictional pundit Navarro quoted in a series of books and a policy memo, using an anagram of his own name.

Everything's fine with Elon,\" Navarro told broadcaster NBC on Sunday. \"Elon is doing a very good job with his team with waste, fraud and abuse. That's a tremendous contribution to America,\" he added of Musk's aggressive cost-cutting through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Navarro had taken aim at Tesla after the billionaire Musk, who also owns SpaceX, proposed a free-trade zone between the US and Europe. The economist claimed Tesla mostly assembled components like batteries and motors shipped in from factories in Asia. Those are exactly the types of jobs Trump says his trade offensive is designed to bring back to America. Musk retorted with studies he said showed \"Tesla has the most American-made cars.\" \"Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,\" he added -- referring to a fictional pundit Navarro quoted in a series of books and a policy memo, using an anagram of his own name. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt tried last week to play down the public feud, saying that \"boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue.\" Elon musk President donald trump \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

Queens Councilman Robert Holden said he doesn\u2019t want his neighborhood to turn into a potential \u201cmini-Chernobyl\u201d The site, which is now vacant at 64-30 69th Place, stands next to a daycare and preschool (Books & Rattles, Inc.), the Juniper Valley Animal Hospital and also lies across the street from PS 128. NineDot Energy spokesperson Karen Alter, when contacted by The Post, said the Brooklyn-based firm had not made a \u201cfinal decision on moving forward.\u201d In a copy of emails with community officials obtained by The Post, NineDot rep Sam Brill defended the safety of such battery sites, including a NineDot battery facility in the Bronx, that for years has \u201csafely operated\u201d 40 feet from a public school. \u201cFDNY wouldn\u2019t let us build these if they weren\u2019t safe,\u201d Brill said.

Archive Magazine Save this story Save Save this story Save The wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk , celebrated on his social media site X late Friday, writing that the \u201cpronoun bs is finally going away.\u201d \u201cThat was silly,\u201d Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency and has been slashing crucial federal funding for months, wrote after reposting a pronoun knock-knock joke. \u201cThank god Trump won,\u201d a user named TheDogeGlory replied below Musk\u2019s post, to which he responded with a bullseye emoji. Musk\u2019s post comes days after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that administration officials would refrain from responding to inquiries from journalists who include their preferred pronouns in email signatures or bios. \u201cAs a matter of policy,\u201d Leavitt wrote in an email from a reporter asking about the closure of a research observatory , \u201cwe do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk arrives on stage at an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Samuel Corum/Getty Images President Donald Trump \u2019s administration, in January, instructed federal employees to remove any reference to their identifying pronouns from their email signatures and other forms as a part of the broad effort to roll back any and all evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Or, as a Texas state employee found out , get fired. Leavitt\u2019s admission this week confirms that the press office is following suit. \u201cAny reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,\u201d the press secretary, who in just a few short months since Trump has taken office has gained a reputation as combative toward both individual journalists and legacy media in general, said in a separate statement to other news outlets. Axios also confirmed on Wednesday that officials will continue to skirt these reporters, asking Trump spokesperson Harrison Fields if that was now their official policy. \u201cFACTS!\u201d he replied. As The New York Times reported this week, \u201cOn at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters\u2019 questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.\u201d A spokesperson for the Times said, \u201cEvading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d they continued, \u201crefusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration\u2019s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025. JIM WATSON/Getty Images In one instance, Matt Berg , a reporter at Crooked Media, the network that runs the \u201cPod Save America\u201d family of podcasts, decided to experiment with the new administration\u2019s handling of journalists who include their pronouns. Berg doesn\u2019t usually include pronouns in his email signature. But, when he included \u201che/him\u201d in an email to Katie Miller , a senior adviser at DOGE, he too was met with a response claiming that the use of pronouns is detrimental to science, that it was her policy to refuse to respond to journalists with listed pronouns, and that he was ignoring facts. \u201cI find it baffling that they care more about pronouns than giving journalists accurate information, but here we are,\u201d Berg said in an email to the Times . The press office has previously been harsh on reporters who do not use the language they prefer. In February, Leavitt and the administration blocked The Associated Press from covering multiple White House events because it refused to change its editorial style from \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds and won\u2014though the White House said it would be appealing. Dozens of protesters gather in Times Square near a military recruitment center to show their anger at President Donald Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017 in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The White House\u2019s handling of pronouns aligns with the president\u2019s coordinated rollback of protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans and those who support them. Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people. In his first moments in office, the president signed an order declaring that the United States would only recognize two sexes, \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale,\u201d as defined at conception\u2014a move that required government agencies to use an outdated and scientifically inaccurate gender binary on documents like passports, visas, and employee records. He also signed others aimed at barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls\u2019 sports teams, restricting funding for gender-affirming care for people under 19, and removing transgender service members from the military. Multiple of Trump\u2019s orders against transgender people are being challenged in the courts. For Musk, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s discussed preferred pronouns on X, formerly Twitter. In 2022, he wrote , \u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.\u201d And in June of 2023, on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he would allow users to intentionally misgender someone without consequence. He also claimed that he personally would use the pronouns that someone prefers for manners\u2019 sake\u2014something he has repeatedly chosen not to do with his own daughter .

The document, first reported by Bloomberg, provides flight attendants with precise instructions on how to cater to the personal and professional preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, reflecting the meticulous attention given to his comfort and routine while in transit. Speed, Silence and Solitude: Inside the Jet Cabin According to the hacked manual, Elon Musk prefers direct and rapid routes regardless of fuel efficiency, a somewhat paradoxical position for the head of an electric vehicle empire known for sustainability. \u201cMr. Musk isn\u2019t interested in conserving fuel,\u201d the memo states, noting that his priority is to \u201cfly as quickly and as direct as possible.\u201d Live Events Onboard, the environment is kept controlled to Musk\u2019s liking: a cool cabin temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, dimmed lighting, and passenger vents turned off due to his aversion to background noise. Unexpected Wi-Fi dropouts are to be avoided at all costs, and staff are advised not to offer unsolicited help with technology, as Musk considers himself \u201cself-sufficient.\u201d Gaming in the Sky: Musk\u2019s Late-Night Livestreams Beyond the logistics of luxury travel, Musk has been using his time in the air to test Starlink\u2019s airborne connectivity, streaming video games from his private jet to millions of viewers. In a recent livestream that attracted over 16 million views, Musk played for 44 minutes, occasionally commenting on topics ranging from turbulence and artificial intelligence to the upcoming season of \"Diablo IV.\" Speaking into the camera in the early hours of April 10, he reflected on personal challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a stressful week, frankly. But today was a good day,\u201d Musk said, moments before resuming gameplay. These livestreams, often broadcast under his alias @cyb3rgam3r420, have become a regular feature of his travel routine, even showing glimpses of his son or spontaneous thoughts about Roman military history or Tesla\u2019s future tech ventures. Gaming Under Scrutiny Despite the casual tone of these videos, Musk has faced criticism within the gaming community. A previous exchange with a YouTuber, NikoWrex, suggested Musk may have considered \"account boosting\" \u2014 a controversial practice where gamers pay others to improve their rankings. The allegation drew ire from gamers and even prompted snark from official game accounts. Musk, while never officially commenting on the claims, did amplify the video in question. However, critics argue that his recent \u201chardcore mode\u201d failures during livestreams \u2014 including multiple in-game deaths and connection issues \u2014 cast doubt on his self-professed gaming prowess. FAQs What was leaked in the NetJets cyberattack? Internal documents from NetJets, a private aviation company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, were leaked following a cyberattack. These include a confidential service guide specifically tailored for Elon Musk, offering detailed insight into his travel preferences and routines aboard private jets. What does the guide reveal about Elon Musk\u2019s travel preferences? Musk prefers fast, direct flights regardless of fuel efficiency. He also requires a cabin temperature of 65\u00b0F, dim lighting, and no use of passenger air vents to reduce background noise. Flight attendants are instructed not to offer tech assistance unless asked.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any \u201cfurther unlawful and unfair action\u201d against OpenAI in a court case over the company\u2019s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution. OpenAI claims that Musk has tried \u201cnonstop\u201d to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using \u201cbad-faith tactics\u201d against it to help him control AI technology. Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a \u201cfor-profit\u201d company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity. OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now and 9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today \u201cThrough press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk\u2019s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI\u2019s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,\u201d In response, Musk\u2019s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI. \u201cHad OpenAI\u2019s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It\u2019s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI\u2019s assets allegedly \u2018interferes\u2019 with their business plans.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): AI Vision Versus EV Weakness - Goldman Balances Long-Term Hopes with Near-Term Risks Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On April 10, Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cNeutral\u201d and cut its price target on the stock to $260 per share from $275. \u201cFor Tesla , we believe that weaker auto demand/consumer sentiment, tariff costs (including in Energy), and US EV policy risk are offset by longer-term potential from its AI related efforts;\u201d Overall, TSLA ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Elon Musk. Elon Musk has been steadily losing popularity among Americans, according to claims made by pollster Nate Silver in his latest tracker. However, Silver's assessment has drawn sharp retort from Tesla CEO Musk who blasted the ratings as \"political propaganda war\". \"We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125,\" Silver posted on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter). Replying to Silver's tweet, Musk wrote, \"The inevitable outcome of having a political propaganda war waged against me while I have almost no countervailing campaign and, at times, digging my own grave way better than my enemies do.\" Silver \"Do Americans have a favorable or unfavorable view of Elon Musk\" tracker shows statistics from January 1, 2024 till April 1, 2025. The timeline comprises Musk's endorsement for then Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, US President elections, and Donald Trump's inauguration and subsequent decisions that Trump administration has taken. Earlier on Thursday, two U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers on Thursday asked the Transportation Department's top ethics official to detail how the agency is addressing Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest given ongoing investigations of SpaceX and Tesla, companies run by the close ally of President Donald Trump. Live Events Meanwhile, Ireland's data privacy watchdog said on Friday it's investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X over its use of personal data to train his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. The Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into \"the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts\" that European users posted on X. FAQs Q1.

In a bold interview with EFN, Gardell called Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and pointed to slowing sales, Elon Musk\u2019s political drama, and Cybertruck struggles as red flags. While Tesla leads in EV innovation, Gardell warns the bubble could soon burst. Swedish billionaire Christer Gardell warns Tesla stock may crash 95%. He says the valuation is unrealistic and linked to Elon Musk\u2019s controversies, falling sales, and Cybertruck struggles Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell has issued a stark warning that\u2019s now catching the attention of Tesla investors worldwide. According to Gardell, Tesla\u2019s market valuation is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and could plummet by up to 95% \u2014 and possibly sooner than many might expect. In a recent interview with Swedish finance channel EFN, Gardell didn\u2019t hold back. He pointed to a mix of slowing sales, rising controversy around CEO Elon Musk, and what he sees as wildly overinflated stock value. Why is Christer Gardell calling Tesla\u2019s valuation a ticking time bomb? Tesla's current market value sits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But Gardell, who runs activist hedge fund Cevian Capital, says that figure doesn\u2019t align with Tesla\u2019s core business. \u201cTesla, especially now with the whole Musk circus going on everywhere, is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now,\u201d Gardell said in the EFN interview, as reported by Teslarati . \u201cIt could go down 95% \u2013 and maybe it should go down 95%.\u201d He clarified that it\u2019s hard to predict an exact timeline \u2014 \u201cIt could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years,\u201d he said. But in his eyes, a drop is coming. And when it hits, it could be steep. Live Events What\u2019s driving fears of a Tesla stock crash? Tesla has moved beyond just being an electric carmaker. The company now deals in robotics and AI, which are both major growth areas. But Gardell emphasized that, at its core, Tesla is still an automaker \u2014 and compared to its peers, its stock is way out of proportion. According to Companies Market Cap , Tesla\u2019s valuation is more than triple that of major auto giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Yet, Tesla\u2019s recent sales trends are not keeping up. Sales have dipped in key markets, and the controversial public presence of Elon Musk hasn\u2019t helped. As political tensions around Musk grow \u2014 especially in the U.S. \u2014 some analysts worry that Tesla\u2019s reputation could be taking a long-term hit. That\u2019s not just bad PR; it could mean real consequences for investor confidence. On top of that, Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated Cybertruck is underperforming. While Musk once projected annual sales of 500,000 units, current figures suggest it\u2019s not even hitting 10% of that. To move the product, Tesla has been forced to adjust financing options and offer more attractive interest rates to buyers. Could a Tesla crash ripple through the EV market? Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV market continues to thrive. In fact, Q4 2024 saw a new record for EV sales in the U.S., according to Cox Automotive . People are still switching to electric vehicles in large numbers, attracted by long-term savings and environmental benefits. But here\u2019s the concern: If Tesla's valuation tanks, will it scare investors away from other EV companies too? It's a real risk. Gardell's worry is that an overvalued company like Tesla might damage broader investor trust in green tech if it falls too hard and too fast. Still, it's not all bad news for EV buyers. As Tesla trims prices and tweaks financing to maintain demand, competitors may follow suit. That could lead to better deals for consumers, not just from Tesla but across the EV landscape. Should investors start looking beyond U.S. tech stocks? Gardell believes the stock market imbalance between the U.S. and Europe is reaching historic levels. \u201cThe difference between American stocks and European stocks has never been greater,\u201d he told EFN. For cautious investors, this may be a moment to reconsider their strategy. European equities, in his view, are offering more realistic valuations. And with companies in Europe also expanding into the EV and clean energy space, there may be opportunities to invest in future-forward industries without the same bubble risk. FAQs: Why did Christer Gardell warn about a Tesla stock crash ? He said Tesla\u2019s value is too high and could drop by 95%. How could Tesla\u2019s stock affect the electric vehicle market? A crash could shake investor trust in EV companies.

In his spare time, James is a long-suffering Rochdale fan and loves reading, running and music. Contact him via [email protected] X @ JimmyMoorhouse Advert Advert Advert Love him or hate him, Elon Musk has been part of some pretty wild projects over the years. Having one of his own cars up in space is perhaps one of the most random. While the Space X founder has lost plenty on Tesla stock in recent months, with Donald Trump 's tariffs only leaving more holes in his pocket , he remains the world's richest man and probably doesn't blink twice when a couple of million evaporates from his bank account. The businessman has taken on more of a political role since Trump's return to the Oval Office. This has hardly done much for the 53-year-old's controversial image, and it seems as though the South African's best work has been beyond Earth's orbit, given the success of various space projects over the years. Running a space company and a car business simultaneously, if you've got a mind like Musk, it's likely you'd put two and two together and send a Tesla up to the stars - and that's exactly what he did in 2018. Advert The Tesla Roadster was ejected into space as a dummy payload for a Falcon Heavy test flight. It's fitted with a mannequin in a space suit called Starman - a tongue-in-cheek nod to the David Bowie classic. The Bowie song Space Oddity was also set up to play on repeat through the vehicle's sound system. The SpaceX team also chucked a Hot Wheels car and a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside for good measure. Elon Musk (Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk previously revealed exactly why he sent the Tesla Roadster skyward, saying that he hoped that humanity would end up living on other planets and that his 'descendants will be able to drag it [the car] back to a museum'. The chances of that may seem pretty low, but the more kids Musk has, the more those chances improve. Musk has also said that he wanted to put the 'silliest' thing he and his SpaceX team could think of out of Earth's orbit, and apparently they settled on a car. Gosh, Elon, your imagination knows no bounds! Anyway, after seven years in space travelling at speeds well above 10,000 mph, you might think that it's tricky to keep track of the Roadster, but fortunately, like nearly everything these days, there's a website for that. Advert The \u2018Where is Roadster?\u2019 site keeps track of the Tesla as it zooms through space. At the time of writing, it is currently 228,647,460 miles from Earth. However, it's travelling back towards its home planet at the lightning-fast speed of 16,106 mph. A real space oddity... (SpaceX via Getty Images) That means that its speed has increased by 5,000 mph in the last week alone. Maybe it's homesick and wants to get back in time for Christmas, learning an important lesson from the NASA astronauts who end up spending far too long away from Earth. So what happens when the space car does finally come back home? Well, Musk could land himself in real trouble if the Tesla does crash land back to Earth. As long as it steers clear of any humans or man-made objects and doesn't cause any damage, it seems as if the billionaire will get away with it. Hopefully it avoids the likes of Mount Kilimanjaro and Niagara Falls, too. Elon Musk says it'll soon be 'possible' to travel from London to New York in just 30 minutes at mind-blowing speeds Elon Musk hit back at hacking group Anonymous after they issued warning about his plans for Twitter Reason why humans haven't orbited poles of Earth before as SpaceX crew make history NASA astronaut makes comment to Elon Musk and Donald Trump in first interview since returning from space Choose your content: 20 mins ago an hour ago 2 hours ago 20 mins ago Elon Musk mocked after people spot \u2018top secret\u2019 message written on his notepad in Trump cabinet meeting The Tesla tycoon seemed to be on the wind up News an hour ago Body language experts analysed how Donald Trump \u2018really felt\u2019 about Vladimir Putin in first ever meeting The leaders first met in Germany in 2017 News 2 hours ago Long-term health impacts of taking ketamine after two women left with serious bladder problems Experts warn ketamine can cause 'irreversible psychological impairment' as well as horrific effects on your physical health News 2 hours ago Man killed in major explosion which destroyed house A major incident was declared in Worksop last night News breaking", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.ladbible.com/news/science/elon-musk-space-science-tesla-latest-roadster-942872-20250411", "source": "LADbible", "published_at": "2025-04-12T16:34:53"}, {"id": 10, "title": "Today's news and jokes", "content": "Super Punch: Today's news and jokes Saturday, April 12, 2025 Today's news and jokes throwback to 6th grade https://t.co/fjwRETFt5q pic.twitter.com/5e2bPwe13n \u2014 Sam Alberti (@sam_alberti) March 8, 2025 Mass Games Womp-womp, they DOGE'd the tariffs. www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/c...

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs.

But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially , and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk\u2019s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn\u2019t about a quick return on investment. It\u2019s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it a grift , pointing to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising and underdelivering . But the market is increasingly more tolerant \u2013 welcoming, even \u2013 of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president\u2019s right-hand men. \u201cAll of Elon\u2019s companies today are basically one company,\u201d Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.\u201d The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that \u201cevery single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,\u201d as Baron phrased it . Other businesses under Musk\u2019s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink \u2013 some of which reportedly share resources . \u201cWhen [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there\u2019s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok [\u2026] and you\u2019re gonna have connected cars all around the world? [\u2026] All these businesses link up. It\u2019s the ecosystem. It\u2019s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it\u2019s really interesting when you look at it that way.\u201d Baron Capital has invested across Musk\u2019s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire\u2019s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk\u2019s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren\u2019t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true when it comes to Musk\u2019s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it has automaker margins , based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \u201cThe reason why [Tesla\u2019s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it\u2019s not about what happens to numbers this year,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s one of Elon\u2019s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.\u201d Munster\u2019s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It\u2019s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X\u2019s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI\u2019s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland\u2019s DPC , which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe\u2019s GDPR law. \u201cAnother kind of risk here is that there isn\u2019t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you\u2019re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,\u201d Wang said. \u201cA lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information [\u2026] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.\u201d Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere for the last several months, Elon\u2019s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.\u201d When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they\u2019re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI\u2019s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. \u201cWe\u2019re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the value [\u2026] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?\u201d Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren\u2019t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk\u2019s superpower to \u201cbend capital markets to his will\u201d in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. \u201cThe people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,\u201d Rechtman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.\u201d Not for nothing, buying into Musk\u2019s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. \u201cSpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon\u2019s good graces.\u201d Topics AI , Elon Musk , Grok , Social , X , xAI Rebecca Bellan Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.
