Elon Musk's net worth has tanked by $121 billion, while Bytedance's CEO is up nearly $14 billion. Their contrasting fortunes are one result of the global trade turmoil sparked by President Donald Trump. America's tech titans have lost billions this year while their Chinese rivals have racked up large wealth gains amid President Donald Trump 's tariff-induced trade war. The tariffs have reignited fears of inflation and recession in the US, spurring investors to dump high-flying tech stocks in favor of safer holdings such as gold and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway . The sell-off has hammered the net worths of most of the richest Americans, whose stakes in tech companies make up the vast majority of their wealth. Trump has aimed some of the highest duties at imports from China, putting the world's second-largest economy under more pressure. Nevertheless, Chinese tech stocks have rallied strongly this year at the prospect of friendlier regulation and fresh government stimulus, boosting the fortunes of China's tech elite. As of Friday's close, the 20 biggest gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index have grown their combined wealth by $139 billion this year \u2014 more than BlackRock is worth. Meanwhile, the 20 largest wealth losers have seen $450 billion vaporized , a figure greater than Exxon Mobil's market value. It's striking that nine of the top 20 gainers are Chinese and only four are American, while 15 of the 20 biggest losers are American and none are Chinese. That trend may speak to how their companies' outlooks have changed , at least in the eyes of the global investment community, and how the US and China are expected to fare in the trade war. The Chinese executives racking up wealth this year include Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming , Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, and BYD founder Wang Chuanfu. They've jointly added a combined $26 billion, with Zhang gaining $13.6 billion, or 31%, to $57 billion \u2014 putting him in 24th place on the rich list. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun is worth $37 billion. Luna Lin/AFP/Getty Images The US bosses hit hardest are Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison , and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . They've lost a collective $193 billion, with Musk shedding $121 billion or 28%. The richest Americans have lost far more than the Chinese elite have gained for a few reasons. Their fortunes are larger, so a 10% swing in their net worth is a bigger move in dollar terms. US stocks as a whole are more richly valued than Chinese equities, making them more vulnerable to steeper declines. It's also worth underscoring the greater role of the Chinese government in shoring up its markets and supporting domestic champions, which can help to limit declines in Chinese stocks . Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Trouble for Tesla Chinese billionaires' wealth gains also reflect their companies' strong progress. For example, BYD 's sales of electric and hybrid vehicles surged by 40% to a record $107 billion last year, surpassing Tesla's revenues of $98 billion, as the Chinese EV maker made inroads into foreign markets . Meanwhile, Tesla stock is under pressure not only because of Musk's proximity to Trump and leading role in cutting government spending and workers, but also because of concerns about tariffs and competition. Politics aside, Tesla has \"struggled with an ageing line up, recalls of its much-vaunted Cybertruck and increased competition, especially from Chinese players like BYD,\" said Danni Hewson of AJ Bell in a recent note. If Chinese executives scale the global wealth ladder while American titans slide down the rungs, it could signal a sea change in market sentiment \u2014 and an upheaval of the global economic order .

Leave this field empty if you're human: Summary : Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter (now X) and original founder of the Bluesky project, believes that the US should \u201cdelete all IP law,\u201d a statement supported by Elon Musk, current owner of X. More people joined the conversation, including dissenting voices. Intellectual property seems to be the eternal topic of debate in the artificial intelligence sector. The nature of AI systems requires collecting as much data as possible from the internet, but content creators (such as publishers and artists) want compensation for this. Now, Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk are advocating for deleting the current IP or copyright law to set more permissive conditions. Copyright and artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence companies operate in a gray area when it comes to copyright. They argue that training AI models falls under the fair use doctrine. This is because, ultimately, these platforms don\u2019t just replicate the original content per se. Fair use allows for copyrighted content if used \u201ctransformatively.\u201d In other words, the output must be something new and not a simple carbon copy of the source material. On the other hand, content creators claim that there is no fair use and that current copyright laws should apply. There is still no clear legislation on the matter, with artists hoping for a resounding victory in court that could serve as a precedent for future lawsuits against AI companies. However, that has not yet happened. \u201c Delete all IP law ,\u201d says Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk supports Amid this situation, the controversial figure of Jack Dorsey emerges . Dorsey was a co-founder of Twitter and started the Bluesky project. However, he left the board of directors of the latter, disliking the direction it was taking. In a recent post on X/Twitter , he stated, \u201c Delete all IP law ,\u201d to which Elon Musk, current owner of X, responded, \u201c I agree .\u201d Some prominent figures in the tech industry have made similar suggestions in the recent past. Until now, the idea has come primarily from the artificial intelligence industry. In March, OpenAI proposed to the US government a deregulation that would allow AI companies to freely use content available on the internet to train their models. Elon Musk has also been vocal in the past about his stance on copyright. He once told Jay Leno that \u201c patents are for the weak .\u201d He also gave the example of one of his companies, Tesla. Musk allowed competitors to freely use his electric car patents \u201c in good faith .\u201d Meanwhile, Dorsey has supported open-source initiatives for decentralized social platforms. More industry figures joined the conversation, such as tech investor Chris Messina, who said that Dorsey \u201c has a point ,\u201d because \u201c Automated IP fines/3-strike rules for AI infringement may become the substitute for putting poor people in jail for cannabis possession .\u201d Returning to Dorsey, he added that there are \u201c much greater models to pay creators \u201d and that \u201c the current ones take way too much from them and only rent-seek .\u201d Some voices against There were also voices against this position. Attorney Nicole Shanahan first responded \u201c NO ,\u201d adding that the \u201c IP law is the only thing separating human creations from AI creations .\u201d To this, Dorsey responded, \u201c creativity is what currently separates us, and the current system is limiting that, and putting the payments disbursement into the hands of gatekeepers who aren\u2019t paying out fairly .\u201d Ed Newton-Rex of the NGO Fairly Trained said, \u201c Tech execs declaring all-out war on creators who don\u2019t want their life\u2019s work pillaged for profit .\u201d Writer Lincoln Michel stated , \u201c none of Jack or Elon\u2019s companies would exist without IP law. \u201d \u201c They just hate artists ,\u201d he added.

Even as Tesla\u2019s fortunes continue to decline , EV sales shot up more than 35% year over year \u2013 now approaching 17% of the market, and that\u2019s WITHOUT government incentives! Spanish media outlet Motorpasi\u00f3n is reporting that Germany\u2019s Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (or KBA; sort of like the American National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, NHTSA) says electric cars already make up 17% of all new vehicle registrations in the European country. And that EV market share is accelerating, despite the cancelation of government EV subsidies in late 2023 . At the same time, Tesla \u2013 whose Model Y electric crossover was, at one point, the best-selling car in the world \u2013 is watching its sales tank globally. That\u2019s especially true in Germany, where the American EV brand saw a 70% drop in sales through the first two months of the year , YOY, and some 94% of survey respondents (allegedly) said they wouldn\u2019t buy a Tesla . All of which begs the question: what gives ? Advertisement - scroll for more content Pull-ahead EV sales + Elon\u2019s Musk New Tesla Model Y; via Tesla. The first part of this two-part answer involves German EV subsidies. The nation\u2019s government issued a \u20ac4,500 subsidy for the purchase of a new EV with a sub-\u20ac40,000 list price (\u20ac3,000 for \u20ac40-65,000 cars). That often-criticized program was always intended to be temporary, however, and after EV sales reached one million units the subsidy was canceled for business customers in September in 2023 and private individuals the end of December . The result of that cancellation was a significant drop in new EV sales in 2024 vs. \u201923 \u2013 but that\u2019s easily explained by \u201cpull-ahead\u201d sales driven by the knowledge that the government subsidy would be ending soon. And, sure, you don\u2019t see the sort of spikes you see in the US when people who don\u2019t understand basic economic concepts or what tariffs are suddenly gain political power, but that has as much to do with the way cars are sold in Europe as anything else. In Europe, car buyers typically visit dealers to look at options and features and work with their salespeople to place an order for a new car. The car is built to their customized specifications, and the customer waits anywhere 3-4 months for delivery. There is no, \u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna take for you to drive one of these home, today?\u201d in other words. That\u2019s part one. The second part is the overwhelming stink of Elon Musk (see what I did there?). The Tesla CEO\u2019s passionate embrace of the alt-right and even far-right political movement combined with not one but two \u201cRoman\u201d salutes at Trump\u2019s inauguration (wink-wink, nudge-nudge) have turned the brand\u2019s electric cars into political statements , whether their owners wanted that or not \u2013 and many are trading out of their Teslas much earlier than they\u2019d originally planned in favor of a vehicle that\u2019s less politically charged.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Korok Ray is a PhD economist/professor who researches/teaches Bitcoin. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 09:00am EDT Share Save Comment Return vs Strike Price for MSTR Put Option Korok Ray MSTR has been on a general downtrend since November 20, 2024. Has it been profitable to short? MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, has been buying bitcoin for years. It reached its highest closing price on November 20 at $473.83 per share. A natural question arises: Why not short MSTR? How would a short strategy have performed since that time? To explore this, I\u2019ll use put options rather than shorting the stock directly. One reason is that calculating the cost of shorting is more complex, as it depends on the interest rates used in equity lending. Additionally, put options are easier to track over time since their prices are reported daily. Finally, I find put options to be a more effective instrument because the potential loss is limited and known in advance, unlike shorting, where the loss can, in theory, be unlimited. As a baseline, note that the price of MSTR on November 20 was $473.83, while on March 12, 2025, it had fallen to $262.55\u2014a decline of 44.59%. So, surely a put option would offer a high return, right? Let\u2019s start by considering a long-term put. Suppose a short seller was uncertain when MSTR would decline and purchased a put option with a $500 strike price on November 20, 2024, expiring 13 months later on December 19, 2025. This option yielded a return of 4%. That\u2019s because it had an ask price of $249.80 on November 20 and a bid price of $259.90 on March 12. Despite the significant decline in MSTR\u2019s stock price over that period, the long-term put returned little. You might think the low return is due to the long expiration period. And you\u2019d be right\u2014options with shorter expirations offer higher returns if the underlying stock moves in the right direction, making the option more in the money. But what expiration date should we choose to maximize returns?

Our goal is to find the return from buying a put option on November 20, 2024, when MSTR closed at its peak. But which strike price should we select? There are many, even for the March 21 expiration. To answer this, I downloaded the bid and ask prices for all MSTR put options with a buy date of November 20, 2024, a sell date of March 12, 2025, and an expiration date of March 21, 2025. I then calculated the return for each option, assuming a purchase at the ask price and a sale at the bid price. This produced a graph of returns by strike price, shown at the start of this article. The maximum return came from the put option with a $520 strike price, yielding a 27% return. While that may seem high, it\u2019s surprisingly low considering the stock itself declined by 44.59% over the same period. Comparison with Tesla To understand why the return from shorting MSTR is relatively low, let\u2019s compare it to Tesla. Tesla closed at $428.22 on January 15, 2025, and three weeks later, it closed at $328.50 on February 11, 2025\u2014a decline of 23.29%. A Tesla put option with a strike price of $370 and an expiration date of February 14, 2025, would have returned 300%. Tesla declined even further to $281.95 on February 27, 2025. A Tesla put option with a strike price of $325 and an expiration date of February 28, 2025\u2014purchased on January 15 and sold on February 27\u2014would have generated a 779% return. Another put option, with a strike price of $260 and expiring on March 21, 2025, could have been bought for $1.89 on January 15, when Tesla closed at $428.22, and sold for $40.80 on March 10, when Tesla traded at $222.15, yielding a return of 2,059%. Granted, this scenario involves perfectly timing both the high and low. However, the point remains: Even with perfect timing on MSTR, you wouldn\u2019t come close to achieving the kinds of returns seen from shorting Tesla. So, what\u2019s going on? Ultimately, option prices depend on many factors, but most importantly, the stock price and its volatility. When MSTR reached its global maximum on November 20, 2024, its volatility was at an all-time high\u2014alongside its price. That elevated volatility drove up the price of the options. This makes sense, as option pricing reflects risk; it's essentially the cost of insurance. Market makers must account for the risk of large payouts if options end up deep in the money. While Tesla also hit an all-time high in January, it reached that level more gradually than MSTR, resulting in lower relative volatility. The key takeaway is that volatility plays a crucial role, not just the stock price itself. Because bitcoin is highly volatile, and MSTR even more so, that volatility impacts option returns in subtle but significant ways, setting them apart from other securities and assets.

Hugging Face plans to sell the robot and will also allow developers to download, modify, and suggest improvements to its code. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for robotics to be as open source as possible,\u201d says Cl\u00e9ment Delangue, chief executive of Hugging Face. \u201cWhen you think about physical objects doing physical things at work and at home, the level of trust and transparency I need is much higher than for something I chat with on my laptop.\u201d Simon Alibert and R\u00e9mi Cadene are research engineers in AI and robotics at Hugging Face. Courtesy of Hugging Face In videos shared by Pollen Robotics, Reachy 2 can be seen performing tricks like tidying coffee mugs and picking up fruit . Matthieu Lapeyre, cofounder and CEO of Pollen Robotics, says several leading AI companies are using Reachy 2 to research robotic manipulation, although he says he can\u2019t name them due to confidentiality agreements. The ultimate goal is for people to use descendants of Reachy 2 in their homes. Courtesy of Hugging Face Lapeyre says selling humanoid robots remains challenging, because the use cases are unclear and the systems are still unreliable\u2014though some companies are starting to find success. Today, the technology is mostly developed by a few well-financed companies, including Tesla, Figure, and Agility Robotics. \u201cWith Hugging Face, we hope to democratize that,\u201d he says. Many AI models, software frameworks, and tools that researchers and engineers rely on to build AI models and applications are already open source. This means the models are shared free of charge, with licenses that allow the code to be modified and reused. Making hardware open source typically means releasing designs, component details, and 3D models that allow pieces to be manufactured more easily. The availability of powerful open-weight AI models (meaning downloadable but not necessarily fully open source) has made it easier for researchers and startups to experiment with cutting-edge AI, as they can see how models work and modify the code. Delangue says that Hugging Face believes something similar is needed in robotics. \u201cHopefully open source can unleash a wide and diverse range of [new robot] capabilities,\u201d he says. Lapeyre adds that open-sourcing hardware has a similar effect. Robot developers \u201ccan [3D] print a part if something is broken,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cif something is not perfect, they can make it a bit better by adding a new part.\u201d The current AI boom has coincided with renewed interest in robotics, as the latest models help enable new advances in the capabilities of hardware systems. Some prominent researchers argue that AI will need a physical presence in order to match or surpass human intelligence, because that advancement may require a direct understanding of the physical world. The hype surrounding humanoid robots has led to some dubious claims. Some of the companies racing to build humanoid robots have posted demo videos on social media that seem to promise incredible abilities. But experts warn that such videos could be misleading. A system that seems extraordinary online could in fact be tele-operated by a person off camera. It could also fail if conditions change even slightly or be unable to complete a task reliably. Delangue says the open source approach should make progress more transparent. \u201cYou can\u2019t cheat; you can\u2019t hide with open source,\u201d he says. Hugging Face already hosts some open source robotics code. Delangue says that use of this code has spiked over the past year, reflecting growing interest in robotics generally. Some robotics researchers, especially those in academia, favor the open approach. \u201cMaking robotics more accessible increases the velocity with which technology advances,\u201d says Sergey Levine, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley and cofounder of Physical Intelligence, a startup working to develop vastly more capable and general purpose robotic models . Physical Intelligence made the first of its robot foundation models, Pi0, available on Hugging Face in February. The model allows a range of different robots to learn to do a variety of physical tasks. Levine says that researchers in academia and industry have already contributed valuable ideas and tweaks to his product. He adds there is potential for outsiders to contribute to the development of new hardware as well. \u201cThere's a lot more creativity people can apply to how they build the actual physical hardware,\u201d he says. The open approach appears to be gaining momentum across the AI industry. Meta was the first major AI company to offer a cutting edge open weight model when it released Llama in 2023. Several other cutting edge open-weight models have followed. In January, a relatively unknown Chinese startup called DeepSeek shocked the tech industry and the stock market by releasing a powerful AI model that was reportedly developed at less cost than those made by US firms. Even OpenAI , the company at the center of the current boom, which has kept its most powerful models a closely guarded secret, said in March that it would change its approach and release a free, open-weight model this summer.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Brad Templeton, who was early at Waymo, covers transportation's future Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 08:15am EDT Share Save Comment A Pony.AI robotaxi in Guangzhou Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images Robotaxi development is speeding at a fast pace in China, but we don\u2019t hear much about it in the USA, where the news focuses mostly on Waymo, with a bit about Zoox, Motional, May, trucking projects and other domestic players. China has 4 main players with robotaxi service, dominated by Baidu (the Chinese Google.) A recent session at last week\u2019s Ride AI conference in Los Angeles revealed some details about the different regulatory regime in China, and featured a report from a Chinese-American Youtuber who has taken on a mission to ride in the different vehicles. Zion Maffeo, deputy general counsel for Pony.AI, provided some details on regulations in China. While Pony began with U.S. operations, its public operations are entirely in China, and it does only testing in the USA. Famously it was one of the few companies to get a California \u201cno safety driver\u201d test permit, but then lost it after a crash, and later regained it. Chinese authorities at many levels keep a close watch over Chinese robotaxi companies. They must get approval for all levels of operation which control where they can test and operate, and how much supervision is needed. Operation begins with testing with a safety driver behind the wheel (as almost everywhere in the world,) with eventual graduation to having the safety driver in the passenger seat but with an emergency stop. Then they move to having a supervisor in the back seat before they can test with nobody in the vehicle, usually limited to an area with simpler streets. Panel at Ride AI conference discusses Chinese robotaxis, including Sophia Tung and Zion Maffeo on ... More the right, and moderator Sophie Schmidt and Helen Pan of Baidu Apollo on left. Brad Templeton MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 - Patch 8 Is Big, Beautiful And Sad Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th The big jump can then come to allow testing with nobody in the vehicle, but with full time monitoring by a remote employee who can stop the vehicle. From there they can graduate to taking passengers, and then expanding the service to more complex areas. Later they can go further, and not have full time remote monitoring, though there do need to be remote employees able to monitor and assist part time. Pony has a permit allowing it to have 3 vehicles per remote operator, and has one for 15 vehicles in process, but they declined comment on just how many vehicles they actually have per operator. Baidu also did not respond to queries on this. No U.S. regulation is that strict, though US companies have followed similar paths, though most have not bothered with having employees in the vehicle but not behind the wheel, as that\u2019s more of a gimmick that something that improves safety. (Some companies which have vehicles with no steering wheel have had, or still have, operations with an employee on board who can stop the vehicle but is unable to grab a wheel.) U.S. permits in California have far fewer stages, with permits for testing, testing with no safety driver, and carrying passengers with or without a safety driver. Some states, like Arizona and Texas have almost no specific regulations. While Waymo and Cruise never made any explicit statements, it is widely believed that when they did their first operations with no employee aboard, they used full time remote monitoring. This is a the prudent thing to do, and is the plan for companies like Aurora and Waabi which have both declared they will operate trucks with no safety driver aboard this year. It is unknown when Waymo stopped having full time remote monitoring, and in fact they have not officially declared it, though based on operational incidents, they obviously don\u2019t, and nor did Cruise (or their dragging incident would be unlikely to have happened.) In addition, Chinese jurisdictions require that the system in a car independently log any \u201cinterventions\u201d by safety drivers in a sort of \u201cblack box\u201d system. These reports are regularly given to regulators, though they are not made public. In California, companies must file an annual disengagement report, but they have considerable leeway on what they consider a disengagement so the numbers can\u2019t be readily compared. Chinese companies have no discretion on what is reported, and they may notify authorities of a specific objection if they wish to declare that an intervention logged in their black box should not be counted. There are strong arguments against such strict reporting. Safety drivers are told to intervene when they have any doubt, which means they will frequently intervene when not necessary. Because companies with mandatory reporting of all interventions want to keep their number down, they may, even unconsciously, discourage interventions. They also don\u2019t want to have to count things like bathroom breaks which have no bearing on safety, leading to the wrong incentive. On the other hand, giving companies full leeway on what counts led to essentially useless reports in California. The right answer is hard. This more strict regulation reportedly also has its own Chinese \u201cflavour\u201d and personal relationships are also important to get permits and deploy. Even so, it\u2019s not slowing things down much, if at all. User Experience Sophia Tung is a YouTuber who is fluent in English and Mandarin and has traveled to China to try the Chinese robotaxis, and has also used them in the USA. Only a modest number of experienced users have had the chance to do this, so it\u2019s good that Ms. Tung has made videos of her experiences. Her first Chinese trip involved a Baidu 5th generation car. Her overall impression was that vehicle, and the service around it were unacceptably poor. However, a return trip involved using Baidu\u2019s newer 6th generation vehicle which she reports is much better; the best of all the Chinese players, and closer to Waymo in quality, though not quite at its level. Her first trip involved limited service, very long wait times, and poor ride quality, but the 6th generation vehicle, in Wuhan, did much better. Oddly, she also rode 5th generation vehicles in Wuhan on her 2nd trip, and they were still of low quality in her view. They have fewer LIDARs and quite probably less compute resources. It\u2019s possible they also haven\u2019t received the newest software because of their old hardware. Baidu did not respond to queries for this story. Tung also got a chance to ride with other players. She found a WeRide Robobus to nearly match the Baidu Apollo ride, though WeRide\u2019s robotaxi wasn\u2019t quite as good. It was at a similar level to the Pony.AI robotaxi in her estimation. The Waymo ride ranks ahead of all of these, and the Baidu Apollo 5th generation vehicle well below. While Cruise is gone, she rode it during its day and felt it was a little worse than the Pony and WeRide robotaxis, but better than the 5th generation Baidu. She has not ridden with AutoX, which has been operating in the Pingshan area of Shenzhen. There has been only limited news recently about AutoX. Of course, it\u2019s important to remember that single experiences and videos tell us only a very limited amount about the quality of a robotaxi. If anything serious goes wrong, you can conclude the vehicle is still very immature. A mature vehicle will drive flawlessly when it comes to major issues like safety and getting stuck or blocking traffic. While all vehicles still make errors, in mature vehicles the errors should be so rare that the odds of an individual encountering one should be quite low. Only bulk statistics can help measure the quality of these vehicles, and none of the Chinese companies release them. (Waymo and Cruise do/did release them, though Tesla, May and Motional do not.) It\u2019s also worth noting that Tung waxed enthusiastically about other elements in the Baidu vehicle not related to the ride quality, such as built in massage chairs, and their use of battery swap (which is much more common in China than elsewhere.) This is impressive considering that Baidu reports their robotaxi only costs around $28,000 to make. Forbes Baidu Launches New $28,000 Robotaxi In Wuhan By Brad Templeton Her enthusiasm raises the question of how much \u201ccomfort features\u201d of Robotaxis will matter when the market gets competitive. She said she would definitely prefer a vehicle with massage, though it\u2019s less clear if that would be preferred with a longer wait time or higher cost. Zoox has bet big on designing its own custom vehicle in order to deliver the best experience they can compared to traditional car forms. Waymo also planned to use a more spacious vehicle from China\u2019s Zeekr, but has apparently scaled back those plans after 100% tariffs were put on Chinese EVs by President Biden, and now have been made higher by President Trump.

The protest sign humorously captured the attention of Elon Musk, highlighting the irony of the demand. Tesla CEO, facing massive criticism due to his controversial role in the Trump administration, instead of taking offence, Musk did what he does best, and joined the meme-fest. Elon Musk did not stop there and went forward with the 'Go to Mars' joke. Elon Musk shared another related post on Twitter. The protests against Elon Musk and his electric vehicle company Tesla have been facing massive protests in US, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world. This Saturday too, hundreds of people protested outside Tesla stores in these countries, \"World Day Against Elon Musk\", denouncing the billionaire entrepreneur. The Tesla boss has now responded to the same. An X, formerly known as Twitter, user named DogeDesigner, who recently shares posts on the tech mogul shared one of the quite common posters from Tesla protests. The poster reads ' SEND MUSK TO MARS '. \u2014 cb_doge (@cb_doge) Sharing the image, DogeDesigner wrote on Twitter: \"Who exactly are they yelling at to send Musk to Mars?

Musk did not stop there and went forward with the 'Go to Mars' joke. Elon Musk shared another related post on Twitter. He shared a Ghibli photo of himself and son X. In the photo, X is wearing a T-shair with 'Occupy Mars' written on it. DogeDesigner shared another post that said: Mars will be called the \u201cNew World\u201d. To this, Elon Musk replied in affirmation, writing 'Yes'.

Follow Authors Apr 14, 2025, 08:08am EDT Share Save Comment The weight loss drug market has exploded , and Kailera Therapeutics is coming for its leaders , Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The firm has licensed four promising obesity therapies from China, which is emerging as a pharmaceutical research and development powerhouse. And having ready-made drugs should enable Kailera to move fast in an increasingly competitive market. Global sales of weight loss drugs swelled 50% last year and could more than triple again by 2028, research shows. \u201cWe have probably the most advanced, diverse, late-stage pipeline that is focused exclusively on weight management, outside of Big Pharma,\u201d says Ron Renaud, the all-star former biotech stock analyst hired to run the company. FIRST UP Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (2nd R) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick look on as President Donald Trump speaks after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025 in Washington, D.C. SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images After the Trump Administration\u2019s trade policy for electronics shifted multiple times over the weekend, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping criticized Trump\u2019s tariffs and called for the protection of \u201cthe multilateral trading system\u201d in an op-ed as the Chinese leader seeks allies. Xi met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez Friday and urged the EU to \u201coppose unilateral bullying practices,\u201d and is wrapping up a diplomatic visit in Vietnam where he made a similar case. Investors are turning to safe havens as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs shake up the global markets, but their preferences are shifting . Gold prices hit a new record Friday, but the U.S. dollar fell to its lowest level since April 2022. \u201cWhat is potentially being compromised is the post-World War II order of international finance where the dollar has been the central pillar\u201d of the global economy, said Bhanu Baweja, UBS Investment Bank\u2019s chief strategist.

BUSINESS + FINANCE Consumer sentiment has taken a hit from the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s tariffs, falling to its lowest level in nearly three years this month, according to a recent University of Michigan survey. The survey shows consumer sentiment down 30% in April compared to where it stood at the end of the Biden Administration in January. Trump\u2019s trade war could have an impact on the president\u2019s constellation of foreign properties , as the tourism industry, which is already showing cracks, could slow down worldwide. But as he paused his latest levies, all 13 countries where Trump does business have signaled at least some willingness to negotiate with the U.S. WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP ANDREJS ZAVADSKIS FOR FORBES Dutch billionaire Remon Vos, a newcomer to Forbes\u2019 2025 World\u2019s Billionaires List, has grown his firm CTP into the second-largest industrial and logistics real estate developer in Europe, earning him a fortune worth an estimated $5.9 billion . And the company is likely to benefit from tariffs in the long term, as companies who want to sell to Europe will have to build their factories there to avoid higher import duties. TECH + INNOVATION \u200b\u200b The fintech industry\u2019s adoption of AI has been slow as a result of regulatory and compliance hurdles, but a new trend is emerging: using AI for deep investment research . It\u2019s still hard to tell which early-stage startup will live up to the hype, but they\u2019re all addressing labor-intensive tasks where improvements are long overdue. Tesla appeared to remove a feature on its website in China allowing customers to purchase two car models the company imports from the U.S. as the trade war between the two countries escalates. The company\u2019s Model S sedan and Model X SUV are produced at a factory in Fremont, California, though the \u201cOrder Now\u201d button is still accessible for Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, as they are assembled in Shanghai.

DAILY COVER STORY Elon Musk Wants To Raise The Birth Rate. He\u2019s Cutting Medical Care For Mothers And Babies. ANDREW HARNIK/GETTY IMAGES When Sevonna Brown learned that Elon Musk\u2019s quasi-governmental agency DOGE had ordered payment stopped on her more than $2 million NIH grant for maternal community healthcare, she started hitting the phones. The network of services for mothers and children that Brown had spent more than a decade building was coming to a screeching halt. Given Musk\u2019s endless warnings that falling birthrates pose an existential threat to civilization, DOGE\u2019s abrupt gutting of maternal health services is simultaneously ironic, and exactly what you\u2019d expect from an effort whose blunders far exceed its claimed, but typically unverifiable, achievements. Musk has donated millions of dollars to fund research on fertility. But at this point, he has taken much more from pregnant women and new mothers than he has given. In February, DOGE threatened a seven-year, $168 million NIH initiative to improve maternal health across the state of Michigan. It suspended more than $27 million in grants to women\u2019s health centers, laid off federal workers running programs for expecting mothers on Medicaid, and cancelled $1.6 million in funding for maternal and postpartum care at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. \u201cWe can\u2019t claim to care about birthrates while defunding the very systems that make pregnancy, birth and parenting safe,\u201d says Emilie Rodriguez. A medical anthropologist, doula, and co-founder of The Bridge Directory, a group of perinatal maternal healthcare providers, Rodriguez worked with Sevonna Brown on the CHAMP Center of Excellence grant. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cThe Department of Government Efficiency is supposed to be about cutting fat from the federal budget,\u201d says Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White. \u201cHere, it\u2019s cutting out vital organs : medical interventions that save lives and help pregnant women have children safely.\u201d MORE Elon Musk Is A Billionaire Federal Welfare Vampire FACTS + COMMENTS It\u2019s been a volatile time for investors since President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d as the S&P 500 netted a more than 5% loss from April 2 through Friday. But some stocks have performed better than others: 90%: The share of stocks on the S&P 500 that declined during that period 50: The number of above-water stocks in that time, dominated by healthcare stocks as well as bargain retailers and defense contractors 34%: The drop in pharmaceutical developer Charles River Laboratories\u2019 stock, making it the worst performing on the S&P since April 2 STRATEGY + SUCCESS Investors are reeling from the fallout over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs , and while it\u2019s typical to take a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach, proactively navigating the uncertainty is possible for those who are patient and forward-thinking. Leaders should absorb that anxiety without passing it on. A manager\u2019s ability to guide their team through turbulence and provide support for employees can help improve overall well-being.

Sign up to get it in your inbox. getty M uch of the news on climate has been discouraging of late. Europe had its warmest-ever March. President Trump is pushing to ramp up mining and use of coal, the most carbon-intense energy source. His administration is also gutting environmental rules, curbing climate research and trying to stop state programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas pollution. But there\u2019s promising news on efforts to cut down on harmful methane emissions generated by cows and other livestock. Globally, cattle are the single largest source of agricultural methane emissions, and efforts are underway to reduce that problem with new types of feeds and improved management of their manure. But the Bezos Earth Fund and Global Methane Hub kicked off a $27.4 million program that\u2019s aimed at breeding cattle and other farm animals that are naturally less gassy. The initiative will provide grants in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Oceania to identify and prioritize the breeding of animals with biological traits that cause them to produce less methane. Within every herd, some animals produce up to 30% less methane than others and selecting and breeding for these traits could lead to substantial cuts in emissions. This means farmers won\u2019t have to change how they feed and raise their animals, making it an easy, no-cost pathway to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cReducing methane from cattle is one of the most elegant solutions we have to slow climate change,\u201d Andy Jarvis, director of the Bezos Earth Fund\u2019s Future of Food program, said in a statement. The Big Read AFP via Getty Images Tesla Cybertruck Sales See A Sharp Dive Tesla\u2019s stock has slid steadily this year, hurt by declining sales and widespread protests over CEO Elon Musk\u2019s leadership of President Trump\u2019s DOGE initiative, which is making haphazard staffing and budget cuts to federal agencies. The electric vehicle maker\u2019s sharp-edged Cybertruck is also sliding, posting sharply lower sales in the year\u2019s first quarter. The Austin-based company delivered just 6,406 Cybertrucks this year through March, according to Cox Automotive. That\u2019s more than double its volume in the year-earlier period, when it was slowly starting to make the hard-to-build model. But the quarterly figure was less than half of what it sold in either the third or fourth quarter of 2024\u201314,416 and 12,991 units, respectively\u2013as its production ramped up. Musk had previously forecast that annual sales of the electric pickup might average 250,000 a year, though it delivered only about 39,000 last year. A combination of multiple recalls\u2013including one last month to fix stainless steel body panels that fell off due to faulty glue\u2013and the likelihood of sharply higher costs for steel, aluminum and imported auto parts due to Trump\u2019s tariffs, suggest Tesla will struggle to boost sales of a model that can sell for about $100,000. Weak demand has also led to an inventory of about 2,400 unsold new Cybertrucks, according to auto news site Jalopnik. Read more here Hot Topic World Economic Forum/Mattias Nutt Tania Strauss, head food and water at the World Economic Forum\u2019s Centre for Nature and Climate, on water scarcity challenges It\u2019s easy to recognize water scarcity in times of drought, but how can we manage rising demand for it from things like data centers and manufacturing as well as population growth? It\u2019s often invisible, but water is vital for industry and society in terms of our health and running our economies and our cities. Just starting to think about the wider water or hydrological cycle being off-kilter, which science is showing us that it is, has a far-reaching impact in ways I think people haven't properly understood. When you're thinking about trends in the consumption of water, you have to look at the bigger picture and say we're experiencing the water cycle being off-kilter\u2013through too much due to flooding and unpredictable weather patterns, extreme weather, or too little water, both in the form of scarcity and in the changing ways in which we can access it. And then, too, polluted water, which in developing countries can be in the form of wastewater that's going untreated and in developed countries can be in the form of contamination of drinking water. It's really touching on literally every industry, every community, every country. Having that wider narrative on the issues around water is important. When you start to get into the consumption trends, 70% plus of water consumption is going into producing our food. The rest is being pushed around for industrial use, and that has challenges. The third is really around cities. If you go industry by industry and start to look at what that means, there is the kind of classic competition for almost every basin on earth from industries like mining and agriculture and manufacturing. Then you have some of these emerging industries that are starting to both operate in water-stressed regions and use water within the ingredients of their business model, like fast fashion, AI and data centers. There\u2019s growing pressure, and we know now that in the next five years, by 2030, we're going to exceed our supply of water with an increased 40% in demand. So how do we reconcile the kinds of solutions that help us reinvent water management and also use much more circular thinking in the way we are approaching some of those problems? What\u2019s the answer? Companies have been more and more cognizant of their footprint, not only in terms of the water they're using within their supply chains but the fact that the communities and the basins where they now need to go and operate are so under stress that they're just not going to have that access. So even though [government] policy may or may not be addressing some of that, you are starting to see it on the industry side, whether it's concrete, whether it's energy or manufacturing, I think they have a little bit more of a real understanding of the cost of water and maybe in a better version of this in the future, the value of water. We need to look at this both around the governance of water, around the fit for purpose finance needed for water, the basin level or sort of waterway specific partnerships that need to happen, at least on the industry side in a pre-competitive way. Then also looking at the tools and the technologies, the policy nexus that can help enable new early-stage tech, but also innovation more broadly toward those outcomes. In terms of sparks of hope, where we're seeing good innovation, I think it's on a number of fronts. One is less sexy, which is that we need cooperation to happen. It isn't some breakthrough, deep-tech solution. We just need people to recognize that they have skin in the game, and they need to come around the table and solve for this.

This \"omnigenius\" fallacy overlooks the crucial role of context in success. Leaders often struggle when switching industries, as seen with John Sculley at Apple and Ron Johnson at JCPenney, proving that skills are often context-specific, and transferring them is not always successful. Reuters Elon Musk Elon Musk \u2019s misadventures with DOGE might be the ultimate example of a powerful flaw in how we think about leaders. That\u2019s our tendency to believe skills and accomplishments are portable, that someone who excels in one venue will be just as impressive in others. I call this exceptional \u2014 if imaginary \u2014 superpower \u201comnigenius.\u201d In reality, though, success doesn\u2019t exist without context. While there\u2019s no pleasure in watching Musk make a mess of the US government, maybe it will help clarify the crucial link between the two. Musk and DOGE show how a leader can be empowered by the omnigenius fantasy. Musk has surely done remarkable things. For all Tesla Inc.\u2019s current struggles, it transformed the automotive sector. And it\u2019s almost impossible to overstate SpaceX\u2019s revolutionary impact on the space industry. Once he joined the government, though, the story changed. In just one notable example, DOGE fired hundreds of employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for the production and security of nuclear weapons and management of nuclear waste sites. But the Trump administration reversed many of the cuts less than 48 hours later, when it became clear what these workers did and how important their roles are. \u201cThe DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,\u201d said Arms Control Association Executive Director Daryl Kimball at the time. Similarly, cuts to programs providing healthcare for 9/11 responders and survivors were later reversed, as were those to Social Security offices. Even DOGE\u2019s website had to delete all five of its biggest claims to savings after media organizations pointed out they were wrong. Live Events Whatever you think of DOGE, we should all agree that accidentally damaging the agency in charge of American nuclear weapons is incompetent execution. And Musk isn\u2019t alone. It\u2019s become routine to see people with private sector successes deferred to as they regurgitate Russian propaganda on Ukraine or spread debunked anti-vaccine theories. This isn\u2019t just about business \u2014 the omnigenius myth runs deep in our culture. In Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Comics Universe, Bruce Banner remarks that he has seven PhDs, an (absurd) shorthand for his multifold genius. (Having personally done just one, the prospect of earning a second could turn me into a giant green rage-monster, too.) On TV, how many times have you watched a character who\u2019s an expert in \u201cscience,\u201d do everything from sequence DNA to hack a computer? And don\u2019t forget the celebrities many of us trust to sell us everything from snacks to cars to prescription drugs. But outside of the arenas that brought them success, why do we listen to these people? And why should they get positions of power in areas where they have little knowledge or experience? The explanation lies in a cognitive bias known as \u201cthe Halo Effect ,\u201d a phenomenon where having one major positive quality tends to skew our perception of someone\u2019s other characteristics. That\u2019s because we often correlate unrelated characteristics, such as intelligence, attractiveness, social skills and loyalty. So if someone is, for instance, particularly attractive, there\u2019s a tendency to rate them as more intelligent, even with no evidence to suggest that\u2019s the case. The halo effect makes us attribute success solely to the person, rather than to the combination of that person and the context he or she inhabits. But context is, virtually always, overwhelmingly important. This is why leaders who switch industries usually struggle. John Sculley sold soda brilliantly at PepsiCo Inc. but nearly derailed Apple Inc. Ron Johnson revolutionized retail at Apple, then tanked JCPenney. In both cases, the CEOs\u2019 latter companies lost more than half their market value during their leadership . Harvard Business School Professors Boris Groysberg and Nitin Nohria looked at people recruited from GE (at the time the pinnacle of American management) to be CEOs of other companies. They found that the leaders succeeded only when the challenges facing their new employer were similar to those they\u2019d encountered at GE. Context is so important that it has a huge effect even when people move within an industry. Other research by Groysberg showed that when most star equity research analysts change banks, their performance drops because the skills that allowed them to excel were actually bank-specific. And my own research shows that leaders who come from outside of a company (as opposed to being promoted from within) tend to produce high-variance outcomes: Sometimes they succeed brilliantly, but more often, they are disastrous failures. Because of the importance of context, success in one area provides almost no information about someone\u2019s ability to succeed in a different one. It is possible to change fields successfully. (Deion Sanders, after all, played in both the Super Bowl and the World Series.) But the odds aren\u2019t good. So, stop seeing haloes. Being a great investor or CEO doesn\u2019t make someone an expert in foreign policy, biomedicine or tax rates. Success is important \u2014 but so is understanding that the limits of any one person\u2019s abilities are usually much narrower than we think.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The new week is off to a silent start as bitcoin looks to establish a foothold above the trendline, characterizing the downtrend line from record highs, with $86K emerging as resistance over the weekend. FLR, TRX and SOL beat the broader market, while the RWA protocol Mantra's OM token tanked during the Asian hours. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

Mantra blamed the 90% crash to 70 cents on forced liquidations on crypto exchanges, while blockchain sleuth Spot On Chain pointed to a significant movement of coins to crypto exchange OKX three days before the crash. Meanwhile, OKX's CEO Star Xu calle d the OM token collapse a major scandal for the entire crypto industry, stressing that all on-chain data is publicly available for scrutiny across major exchanges. In other news, data tracked by IntoTheBlock showed a renewed uptick in transaction volumes on Virtuals Protocol, a blockchain project enabling the creation, ownership, and deployment of AI agents. Data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence said that Mechanism's Capital Andrew Kang doubled his bullish bet on BTC, now holding a long worth $200 million. New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) discussed the relative stability of the crypto market and its orderly behavior during last week's carnage in the traditional markets, saying it could become a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle. Still, some investors anticipate a range-bound trading pattern for bitcoin (BTC) due to concerns that the U.S.-China trade tensions will not be resolved quickly. This follows President Trump's late Friday decision to exempt certain products from Chinese tariffs, a gesture perceived as a willingness to negotiate. \"BTC continues to consolidate within the $80k-$90k range and could continue trading sideways, adopting a \"wait and see\" approach to the tariff situation,' QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast, noting the weekend demand for the $100K calls. Per Bloomberg's Lisa Abramovicz, there is deep skepticism in cheering Trump's late Friday pivot. \"This is still a sell rallies environment. Tariff uncertainty, growth weakness, a Fed risking policy errors in both directions and fund outflows all suggest wider spreads ahead,\" Abramovic quoted Deutsche Bank's Credit Analyst Steve Caprio as saying. Some market participants expressed concerns about the dwindling demand for the spot bitcoin ETFs, which registered an outflow of over $700 million last week, according to data source Farside Investors. \"ETF demand is cooling. A sharp drop in bitcoin spot ETF assets signals institutional outflows. Watch this trend closely,\" blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant said on X. Lastly, major U.S. equity indexes, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, appeared headed for the death cross, a bearish technical pattern involving the 50-day simple moving average's (SMA) move below the 200-day SMA and the dollar index looked oversold as per the 14-day relative strength index. Both observations called for caution in risk assets. The key events and data to watch out for the week ahead are Monday's stock market reaction to Trump's tariff exclusions, Wednesday's U.S. retail sales and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech and earnings reports on Wall Street on Friday.

Since April 7, 2025, 17 wallets, including two linked to Laser Digital (a MANTRA investor), deposited 43.6M $OM tokens ($227M, 4.5% of circulating supply) into exchanges like OKX and Binance, just before a major price crash, raising suspicions of insider selling or manipulation. Who dropped the price of $OM ? Before the $OM crash(since Apr 7), at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6M $OM ($227M at the time) into exchanges, 4.5% of the circulating supply. According to Arkham\u2019s tag, 2 of these addresses are linked to Laser Digital. Laser Digital is a strategic\u2026 pic.twitter.com/zB8yAPRPSO \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 14, 2025 The MANTRA team denied involvement, attributing the crash to \u201creckless liquidations\u201d by exchanges during low-liquidity hours, claiming their tokens remain locked and verifiable on-chain, though community trust is shaken. Investors expressed devastation on X, with users such as @Jeetburner, claiming to have lost over $3.5 million. Critics accused MANTRA and Binance of a \u201cliquidity exit\u201d and threatened legal action, while MANTRA\u2019s Telegram group closed to new users. The incident may impact credibility in the RWA sector as real-world bigwigs - such as UAE real estate giant DAMAC, in Mantra's case - keep wary of projects with volatile token prices. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates for more major tokens, excluding XRP, remain mildly positive below the annualized 10%, reflecting a moderately bullish positioning. BTC's rally has stalled near $85K in the past 24 hours. Futures open interest has dropped from $16.4 billion to $15 billion, a sign that traders are taking some risk off the table. XRP's recovery since April 7 has not been backed by an uptick in open interest, raising questions in the market about the sustainability of gains. On Deribit, the short-term BTC and ETH options skew remains negative, but the so-called put bias has weakened significantly since last Monday. The mid-term and longer-term skews have flipped back in favor of calls.

Katie Flores / Billboard via Getty Images / Source : NBC Los Angeles By Karla Rendon, NBC Los Angeles A Santa Monica man was arrested Saturday around 12:15 p.m. after he threatened to bomb the Coachella Music & Arts Festival, the Cathedral City Police Department said. Police were notified of a suspicious man at Agua Caliente Casino after security guards were approached by a man traveling in a Tesla who said he\u2019d \u201cbe responsible for a bombing\u201d at the festival, according to police. Using DMV information, officers identified the vehicle\u2019s owner and began to search for him. While police looked for the man, they notified law enforcement officials at the festival of the threat. Investigators used Flock ALPR cameras to track the man\u2019s movements through the Coachella Valley and located his car in Palm Springs shortly after midnight. He was arrested in the city, and a subsequent search of his vehicle showed that no weapons, explosives, or bomb-making materials were in his possession. The man, who was identified as 40-year-old Davis Darvish of Santa Monica, was arrested and charged with making bomb threats. He is being held on $1 million bail.

The victims gathered at their mosque in Johns Creek on Monday to discuss the new developments. The Brief Lawyers for three Muslim women who were harassed by the ex-husband of the U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have reached a settlement with the lawmaker's former spouse over the incident. The incident, captured on the Muslim holiday of Eid ul Fitr, shows Greene shouting offensive remarks at a group of women wearing hijabs from a Tesla Cybertruck, sparking widespread outrage. Greene has previously publicly and privately apologized for his statements and said he hoped the women would forgive him. ALPHARETTA, Ga. - Three Muslim college students who were verbally harassed while praying outside the Avalon shopping center in Alpharetta have reached a $75,000 settlement with Perry Greene, the ex-husband of Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. During a news conference Monday in Johns Creek, attorneys for the women and representatives from CAIR Georgia revealed new details about the case and its resolution. The women said Greene contacted them through their attorneys after the video began circulating online. He later apologized to them privately and issued a public apology earlier this month. RAW: Ex-husband of Marjorie Taylor Greene settles harassment complaint Attorneys representing the 3 women who were verbally attacked by the ex-husband of Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene held a press conference Monday to announce a settlement from Perry Greene. PREVIOUS: Ex-husband of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene apologizes to Muslim women In addition to the apology, Greene agreed to pay the women $75,000, which they have since donated to their local mosque. The women said they believe Greene was sincere in his apology and expressed hope that the incident could serve as a broader lesson in tolerance and respect. \"Today, I want to tell Mr. Greene that we accept his apology, and we hope that he will continue to treat others with fairness, respect, equality and dignity,\" one of the women said during the press conference. Settlement over verbal attack caught on video The ex-husband of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has reached a settlement with three Muslim women after he was caught on camera verbally harassing them while they were trying to pray in an Alpharetta parking garage. The backstory: The confrontation occurred in late March at the Avalon mall in Alpharetta. The three women, who were wearing hijabs, had pulled into a quiet area of the parking lot to pray when the altercation unfolded. \"We came here just to enjoy some desserts,\" Nesrine, one of the victims, said. \"It was time for one of the prayers to end, so we wanted to make sure we reached it. We set our carpet up, our prayer rug, right next to our car in an empty parking spot tucked away in the corner.\" Three Muslim women said they were verbally attacked by a stranger in Alpharetta while praying. (FOX 5) The video shows a man leaning out of a Tesla Cybertruck and directing hateful comments at a group of women, including telling them to \"go back to their country.\" The video prompted outrage from community members and civil rights organizations. PREVIOUS STORY: Caught on camera: Man hurls insults at Muslim women praying in Alpharetta Perry Greene settles harassment claim Perry Greene, ex-husband of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, has settled a harassment claim made by 3 Muslim women who were praying when they were verbally attacked by Greene. In early April, Perry Greene apologized at the women's place of worship in Johns Creek during Friday prayer services. Greene met privately with the women, who had requested a public apology after the incident drew widespread attention. What they're saying: \"I just wanted them to know I humbly apologize to them because nobody should be treated that way, and that\u2019s not the way to treat anyone with differences,\" Greene said. \"Hopefully they find it in their hearts to forgive me, and we shouldn\u2019t allow that in our society.\" Man who verbally attacked Muslim women apologizes A mea culpa from the man who verbally attacked three Muslim women earlier this week. The man in a now viral video verbally attacking three Muslim women says he is sorry. He apologized to the three women today at their house of worship and says he hopes they will forgive him. Attorney Ali Awad, who is working with the victims, said Greene has expressed interest in making a donation to a nonprofit combating Islamophobia. \"He has entertained the idea of issuing a donation to a nonprofit battling Islamophobia. Our goal here is education. We do not kick people while they are down,\" Awad said. \"We chose to take the high ground today. We chose peace. We chose to allow Mr. Greene to come to the community and issue an apology directly to the family.\" Greene did not answer questions from the media following the apology. The other side: Ali Awad, the group\u2019s attorney, said his clients chose reconciliation after what they felt was a sincere expression of remorse. \"In the Islamic tradition, when an enemy comes and apologizes and brings their head down and gives you what my clients believe was a sincere apology, we accept it and we move on,\" Awad said. \"In Islam we show grace even to our enemies,\" Nesrine said. \"Our hope is even those who hated us will begin to accept us as equals. Nothing more.\" Supporters say they are choosing peace but want the encounter to be a teaching moment. Azka Mahmood, executive director of the Georgia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the incident is part of a troubling trend. \"Since the genocide in Gaza began, CAIR Georgia has recorded a 250% increase in anti-Muslim incidents in Georgia alone,\" Mahmood said. She said the incident highlighted the urgent need for continued community education against harassment. What's next: The women plan to donate the entire settlement to their mosque. Alpharetta police are not filing charges against Greene for the incident, saying in a statement that \"in our community all speech is protected - even the speech we may not agree with.\" The Source: Information for this story came from a release by CAIR-Georgia and previous FOX 5 reporting.

First it was a lack of stock, then parts, then supply. All of this causes prices to shoot up. Along with rising prices also came the lack of quality. Featured Video With owners complaining about transmission issues and parts being purposely made to be replaced, not fixed, lots started to fill with overpriced new models. Now with tariffs expected to impact not only vehicles made outside the U.S., but the parts inside vehicles as well, car expert and dealer Robb the Car Guy (@robbthecarguy) shared his worry about the auto market on TikTok after visiting a Bank of America repo lot. At the Bank of America repo lot Robb begins his video by expressing his shock at the sheer amount of vehicles at the repo lot. Advertisement \u201cNever seen this many repos in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cCome to the auction every week. I always said the car economy is doing good, but now for the first time I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m in Bank of America\u2019s [repo]. Bank of America has good credit customers. This is franchise dealers making the sale.\u201d In the lot were a variety brand new vehicles ranging from a sports cars to sedans. Then Robb saw the perfect example of the type of cars he found at the repo lot: A brand new Chevy Tahoe with 27,000 miles on it. When he looked inside he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThe inside still smells new. It\u2019s mint!\u201d he said. Advertisement Afterwards he discovered a lot of brand new, mint condition vehicles, ranging from a 2025 Honda with 2,000 miles on it to a brand new Chevrolet Corvette with 6,000 miles on it. \u201cIn order to qualify for these cars you got to make six-figure income,\u201d Robb explained. \u201cThese people are getting their cars repossessed. This is people who care about their credit.\u201d According to Robb, the sheer amount of \u201chigh dollar earners\u201d getting their cars repossesed signaled a serious threat to the future of the car industry. \u201cCars have priced themselves out of the market,\u201d he said. Advertisement What did the viewers think? A lot of viewers in the comments had their own theories for the amount of new cars at a reputable credit lender\u2019s repo lot. The video has amassed over 183,000 views since April 9. \u201c70% are people living above their means,\u201d one said. \u201cGovernment employees getting fired,\u201d another remarked. Advertisement \u201cPeople we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet the economy is slowly crashing. This has nothing to do with people living above their means. People are losing jobs left and right,\u201d another warned. Others agreed that the issue is the high car prices. \u201cCrazy part is these new cars are made cheaper and cheaper and they cost more and more,\u201d a user said. \u201cPeople are paying $40k for Honda Accords now,\u201d a second added. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s all people that thought a $1,200 car payment was reasonable,\u201d a third said. \u201cAs someone who just got out of the car selling industry, I will say it\u2019s not the time for a car payment. The numbers I have seen are astronomical!!\u201d another warned. \u201cThose cars are from people that overpaid and now are worth much less due to the inflation and mark ups from 2021-2023. The owners decided to take the credit to offload a huge debt that wasn\u2019t worth it anymore,\u201d a user theorized. Auto market predictions In January, multiple experts were predicting a better auto market than 2024. Kelley Blue Book reports that 2025 predictions have the amount of Americans buying cars rising from 15.85 million in 2024 to 16.3 million in 2025. Morning Star backs up these stats and claims that the vehicle sales won\u2019t be disrupted due to tariffs . Advertisement YouTuber Untamed Motors , an auto market expert who worked in industrial organizational psychology and owned an auto brokerage service, said that tariffs will not impact sale prices in the long term. \u201cI personally believe that we will not be as impacted by this added 25% tariffs by vehicle manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean they don\u2019t have the what i mean by that is \u201cVehicle manufacturers do not have the luxury to hike up prices 25%. They do not have a choice.\u201d According to Untamed Motors, automakers and dealers have not been able to sell their new cars, and at dealerships there are \u201clines upon lines of unsold inventory.\u201d This has caused \u201cinventory levels to grow by 120% in the last 2 1/2 years.\u201d @robbthecarguy #robbthecarguy #moneymanweems #Inflation #Cars #Value #Economy #Quitting #Giving #Hard #Struggle #Affordable #Affordable #Donald #Trump #Maga #Musk #Elon #Tesla #BankOfAmerica #Santander #Truist #Chase #Repo #Repossession #Tow \u266c original sound \u2013 RobbTheCarGuy Advertisement He predicts that there will be a surge in pricing for a few months while people panic buy and automakers attempt to pass on the cost to the customers, but they will be forced to drop their prices due to the lack of sales.

It\u2019s not that simple - Poynter Donate Fact-Checking SUVs sit on display at a Ford dealership Friday, April 4, 2025, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher) By: Amy Sherman April 14, 2025 President Donald Trump and his allies have offered a solution for avoiding price hikes because of his car tariffs: buy American. Trump told NBC News March 29 that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if foreign car manufacturers raise prices in response to tariffs. \u201cI hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have plenty.\u201d The administration\u2019s 25% tariff on imported cars took effect April 3, and an additional tariff on imported auto parts is set to take effect May 3. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their cost is often passed down to consumers through higher prices. Fox News\u2019 host Jesse Watters made a similar statement April 3: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried cars are going to cost more, buy American.\u201d Watters cited a clip of Ford Motor Co.\u2019s promotion to temporarily give customers its employee rate on cars. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who owned multiple car dealerships before taking office, echoed Trump in an April 2 CNN interview. Moreno said the \u201conly ones that are mostly hurt are the cars that are made overseas, exclusively, and are shipped into the United States. The ultra luxury cars.\u201d That is contradicted by an analysis by Cox Automotive, a research firm, which found that the \u201c25% tariff on imported vehicles will apply to nearly 80% of vehicles priced under $30,000,\u201d citing models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Trax and Trailblazer, Nissan Sentra and Honda HR-V. Moreno added, among \u201cmainstream cars, a Honda, a Toyota, a Subaru, a Ford, a Chevy, if one car goes up in price, because there\u2019s a tariff? That person will just buy the other one that doesn\u2019t have a tariff, which is your American-made automobile.\u201d Many car experts said it\u2019s not so simple to avoid price increases by buying American, because American autos assembled in the U.S. also use imported parts. \u201cThe concept of an American made car with all parts from the U.S. is a fictional tale,\u201d said Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey will tariff those parts.\u201d Car companies rely on imported parts to varying degrees. For example, the Tesla Model Y has 70% of the value of its parts made in the U.S. or Canada, while the Ford F-150 has 45%. The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists have said it\u2019s unlikely high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans. In response to PolitiFact\u2019s email asking about Moreno\u2019s statement on American-made cars, a Moreno spokesperson attacked PolitiFact and provided no answers to our questions about cars and tariffs. The White House, when contacted, said that some auto parts are exempted from tariffs. Many car manufacturers in the U.S. use imported parts Moreno said U.S. assembled cars that get parts from Mexico and Canada will be \u201ccompletely tariff free\u201d if they comply with the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement that Trump\u2019s administration negotiated in 2018. But many auto parts used in the U.S. come from countries other than Mexico and Canada. Jason Miller, a Michigan State University supply chain management professor, examined auto tariff data and told PolitiFact it showed Mexico \u201cclearly top of the list\u201d for car parts imported into the U.S., but China is No. 2 (because of lithium ion batteries), Japan is 4th, South Korea 5th, and Germany 6th. As of April 10, products imported from China have a 125% tariff . Miller said Trump\u2019s other tariffs on steel and aluminum mean that even if a car were 100% assembled from only domestic components, costs still would rise because steel and aluminum prices are increasing in the U.S. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t oversimplifying things, they are outright lying,\u201d Miller said about people saying car shoppers can purchase all American-made cars. Also, not all auto parts from Mexico comply with the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, so those are being tariffed, too, he said. Amy R. Broglin-Peterson, a Michigan State University expert on supply chain management, said, \u201cAll vehicles use at least some percentage of foreign parts, period. There is no vehicle model that uses 100% American-manufactured parts.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported April 4 that on first glance, Ford is best positioned to weather tariffs because 80% of its cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in America are manufactured domestically, and so are many of the parts. Many components of Ford\u2019s F-150s, such as alternators and wheels, come from other countries, and starting in May those parts could face a new 25% tax, the Journal wrote, \u201cso even though Ford\u2019s trucks are built in the American heartland, import tariffs could jack up the average price by thousands of dollars.\u201d The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publishes data about the U.S. and Canadian content by value of the parts used to assemble passenger motor vehicles in the U.S. and in foreign countries. The data showed that some Toyota car lines built in the U.S., such as Corolla, include at least 25% value of parts imported from Japan. A Toyota spokesperson told PolitiFact that 47% of vehicles the company sold in the U.S. in 2024 were built in the U.S. USA Today analyzed NHTSA data for multiple automakers and found that \u201cfor all models assembled and available for sale in the U.S., 47% of the parts (by value) originated from the U.S. or Canada.\u201d A Cox Automotive spokesperson said that the average American made vehicle has about 50% of its parts or components by value imported. Car prices could rise because of Trump tariffs The tariffs\u2019 long-term effect on the car industry is difficult to predict. Cox Automotive predicted strong sales until pre-tariff inventory declines. \u201cBut all roads lead to this fact: In the coming months and years, as new tariffs settle into place, vehicle prices in the U.S. are expected to increase,\u201d Cox wrote in an April 4 market insights report. Cox predicted that vehicles affected by these tariffs could see prices increase 10% to 15%, and at least a 5% increase for vehicles not subject to the full tariff. \u201cProduction disruptions and declines could be a reality this summer, especially as automakers and suppliers work to align practices with the new rules,\u201d Cox wrote. As prices of cars manufactured in foreign countries rise, producers of competing U.S. models with fewer imported parts will raise their prices, not dollar for dollar, but perhaps 40 cents per dollar, Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted. \u201cU.S. auto manufacturers are hurting, and they will raise prices where they can,\u201d Hufbauer said.

Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter By Red Painter \u2014 April 14, 2025 On the first night of Passover, one of the highest holidays for Jews, the Pennsylvania Governor's mansion was set on fire in a probable act of arson. Why does the first part of my sentence matter? Because the Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, is Jewish. And this crime was committed on Passover, a holiday that commemorates the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt and it begins on the first night with a meal called a \"Seder\", during which stories are read from a book called a \"Haggadah\". This meal has many parts and is often HOURS long (my family seders usually went 4-6 hours, depending on how many bottles of wine were consumed. Back to Governor Shapiro. He is Jewish and a Democrat, clearly 2 things that many Trump supporters dislike, so I do not personally believe the night chosen (out of 365) was without symbolism. Here is what the AP is reporting : \"Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement that, while the investigation was ongoing, they were \u201cprepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson.\u201d State police gave no other details about the cause of the fire at the riverfront mansion but said it caused a \u201csignificant amount of damage\u201d to a portion of the residence. Shapiro and his family had been in a different part of the residence, police said.\" The family was awakened by loud bangs on the door at 2am by police who were there to notify and evacuate them. Thankfully all the damage appears to property and no one was hurt. State police are offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Shapiro is a leading contender for the Democratic Party as it seeks out new leaders for the 2028 Presidential election. Will Pam Bondi treat this as seriously as a vandal who attacks a Tesla dealership? My guess is no, especially if it turns out a Trump supporter was to blame. UPDATE: A suspect has been arrested. Cody Balmer, 38 years old, of Harrisburg PA. He will be charged with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson, and aggravated assault. Balmer allegedly jumped the fence, thereby avoiding security that was stationed outside, and used homemade incendiary devices. Motive is still unclear. Can you help us out?

Leapmotor will refund the relevant fees to those who have subscribed to the company\u2019s Navigation Assist Pilot (NAP) software by the end of May, and new customers now have access to the advanced driver assistance system without extra charges, according to a statement.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app. As the stock markets crashed on Friday, April 4, Donald Trump left Washington, D.C. He did not go to New York to consult with Wall Street. He did not go to Dover, Delaware, to receive the bodies of four American servicemen, killed in an accident while serving in Lithuania. Instead, he went to Florida , where he visited his Doral golf resort, which was hosting the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament, and stayed at his Mar-a-Lago club, where many tournament fans and sponsors were staying too. His private businesses took precedence over the business of the nation. Many of his guests were also interested in boosting Trump\u2019s personal interests, as well as gaining the American president\u2019s favor. One of them was Yasir al-Rumayyan, who runs the $925 billion Saudi sovereign-wealth fund and is also the chair of the LIV tournament. Other sponsors of the tournament included Riyadh Air, a Saudi airline; Aramco, the Saudi state oil company; and, startlingly, TikTok, the Chinese-owned social-media platform whose fate Trump will personally be deciding, even as he profits from its sponsorship and support. Once upon a time (and not even that long ago), blatant conflicts of interest, especially involving foreign entities, were something presidents sought to avoid. No previous inhabitant of the White House would have wanted to be seen doing personal business with companies from countries that seek to influence American foreign policy. Such dealings risk violating the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting \u201cgifts, titles or emoluments from foreign governments.\u201d But during Trump\u2019s first term, the court system largely blew off his commercial entanglements. Now he not only does business with foreign as well as domestic companies that have a direct interest in his policies, he advertises and celebrates them. We know the identities of the golf-tournament sponsors not because investigative journalists burrowed deep into secret contracts, but because they appear on official websites and were displayed on a billboard, observed by The New York Times , at his golf course. Both the website and the billboard would have been scandals in any previous administration. If they are hardly remarked upon now, that\u2019s because Trump\u2019s behavior is a symptom of something much larger. We are living through a revolutionary change, a broad shift away from the transparency and accountability mandated by most modern democracies, and toward the opaque habits and corrupt practices of the autocratic world. For the past decade, American government and business alike have slowly begun to adopt the kleptocratic model pioneered by countries such as Russia and China, where the rulers\u2019 conflicts of interest are simply part of the fabric of the system. The change began during Trump\u2019s first term\u2014Vice President Mike Pence once made a 180-mile-plus detour on a trip to Ireland, in order to stay at a Trump hotel\u2014but Trump was constrained by his advisers and perhaps by what was then still his fear of legal consequences. This time around, he knows he got away with a series of crimes, including an attempt to overthrow an election. His advisers are supine; he feels no more constraints. New standards were already set in December, when the Trump Organization announced the construction of a Trump Tower in Saudi Arabia, an investment that posed a clear conflict of interest for the president-elect. Trump\u2019s family also created a cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, that could, in practice, serve as a vehicle for anyone to pay him indirect bribes. Nobody around him objected. After Trump\u2019s return to office, his administration, unbothered by appearances of impropriety, did indeed quickly suspend a civil investigation into Justin Sun, a Chinese entrepreneur and an adviser to World Liberty Financial, who had also invested at least $75 million in the company. More recently, The Wall Street Journal discovered that executives from Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange, met with Treasury officials to ask for looser oversight, even while they were at the same time negotiating a private business deal with World Liberty Financial. In the past, Binance has been fined $4.3 billion, a record , for letting terrorists, drug traffickers, and people under sanction use its exchange, so the company\u2019s interest in looser oversight is not theoretical. In keeping with the new atmosphere, the inauguration itself became an ostentatious display of the new administration\u2019s kleptocratic values. American tech CEOs were the most prominent guests and got the most attention, but several foreign business partners of the Trump Organization also attended inauguration-related events, posed for photos with Trump, and referenced their connections to his presidency in promotional materials. Several lesser-known companies involved in regulatory and other negotiations with the U.S. government quietly donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Soon afterward, in a late-night purge, Trump fired 17 inspectors general, all people who were responsible for monitoring corruption and ethical violations inside the government. Trump isn\u2019t just disregarding old norms for his own sake. He\u2019s making it easier for others to cut corners too. From the beginning of his career, Trump participated enthusiastically in the opaque, offshore world of shell companies and anonymous bank accounts, a milieu that has always attracted autocrats, criminals, and anyone else who seeks to hide their money. As of 2018, more than one out of every five condos in Trump-branded buildings had been purchased by shell companies whose true owner was unknown, and anonymous owners continued to buy into his businesses during his first term as president. Now his administration is helping other businesses that operate in the shadows to stay there. Trump\u2019s Treasury Department announced last month that it would no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act, hampering recent congressional efforts to end money laundering, tax dodging, and other lawbreaking by anonymous investors. In an executive order, Trump suspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which prohibits American and foreign companies from paying bribes to do business. The Department of Justice is also disbanding a task force set up to administer sanctions on Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. Oversight will be removed from many domestic financial and government institutions too. Trump ordered a full work stoppage at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which had been created to protect consumers from manipulation by banks and other financial institutions He has fired top officials overseeing ethics, whistleblower protections, and labor rights, including the heads of the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Merit Systems Protection Board. Meanwhile, Justice Department officials are drafting plans to reduce investigations of fraud and public corruption , which means that prosecuting crooked officials will be more difficult. Cuts to the IRS mean that tax fraud will also be harder to identify and prosecute. Just last week, the Justice Department announced that it would curtail investigations of cryptocurrency fraud and disband its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. From the June 2024 issue: The new propaganda war One particular Trump backer has already profited from this new world in which conflicts of interest just don\u2019t matter. Elon Musk, who has no mandate other than the personal blessing of the president, now has enormous influence over the very same government institutions that have long subsidized and regulated his companies. Musk slashed jobs at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal agency that oversees auto safety and crash investigations, including those involving his own electric-vehicle company, Tesla. Musk oversaw mass firings at other regulatory agencies that had launched more than 30 investigations into his companies, which include SpaceX and Neuralink. Kayla Bartkowski / Getty At the same time, major government agencies, including the General Services Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, are using or were considering the use of Starlink , a product of SpaceX. The State Department planned to buy armored Teslas. One Commerce Department official, Evan Feinman, resigned last month because of an administration push to use Starlink to provide rural broadband services. \u201cStranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world\u2019s richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,\u201d he said. Musk isn\u2019t breaking the law, and he doesn\u2019t have to say or do anything to encourage these changes. His new role as America\u2019s premier oligarch means that all kinds of people and agencies will kowtow to him anyway. Musk has also had real influence over American foreign policy. If they are upheld by courts, DOGE\u2019s cuts to USAID, to the U.S. Institute of Peace, and to U.S.-backed foreign broadcasters, including Voice of America, will all deliver deep blows to American diplomacy and soft power, in addition to the damage they will do to international health care and humanitarian aid. The end of American-funded broadcasting by itself will particularly benefit China, which competes with the U.S. in the realm of narratives and ideas as well as economics. It\u2019s curious that Musk was in a position to make these decisions, all so favorable to Chinese soft power, even though he has important ongoing business relationships in China. His \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Shanghai, opened with hundreds of millions of dollars in Chinese loans, has become Tesla\u2019s largest production site . But in Trump\u2019s administration, outside interests are no big deal. To take one of many examples, FBI Director Kash Patel, during his Senate hearings, revealed that he has accepted $1 million to $5 million in stock as payment from the corporate parent of Shein, a Chinese e-commerce company that has been accused of using forced labor in its supply chain ; he told senators that he would not divest. Patel has also consulted for the Czechoslovak Group, a foreign arms conglomerate that J. D. Vance, when he was still a senator, said had \u201cties to the inner circle of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u201d Although Patel, in his new role, will be responsible for countering Russian and Chinese influence and espionage operations, 51 Senate Republicans nevertheless confirmed him. But these are only the conflicts of interest we know about. How many people benefited last week from advance knowledge that Trump would reverse his position on tariffs? How many others are making other stock-market bets based on their access to government information? We don\u2019t know the answers, and Trump\u2019s Department of Justice is unlikely to want to find out. We are living in the dark, just as people do in other kleptocracies, and this changes everything. E arlier this year , I published a book, Autocracy, Inc. , which argues that many modern dictatorships are best analyzed not through the prism of ideology but through the political and financial interests of the people who run them. The presence in the American government of so many people, most notably the president, whose financial interests can be directly and immediately affected by their political decisions means that we now need a different way of analyzing American policy too. To understand Trump\u2019s policies toward Russia and Ukraine, for example, one should ask not merely How will they end the war? and How will they shape America\u2019s relationship to Europe? but Who in Trump\u2019s immediate circle will benefit from the lifting of sanctions? and Have the Russians made explicit financial offers already, and to whom? The rare-minerals deal now being negotiated with Ukraine deserves especially close scrutiny. We need to establish which Americans, exactly, will benefit, and how. The right question to ask about Trump\u2019s tariff policy is also financial: How will this enormous change to American trade policy benefit Trump? One answer is already clear. The countries and large companies damaged by these tariffs, some of which could face huge losses or even bankruptcy, will have an enormous incentive to play up to the president, to offer him political donations, and maybe even to offer business deals to him, his family, or his friends in order to get some kind of exception made for themselves or their industry. In a law-abiding administration, personal finances wouldn\u2019t be an important part of the public debate. But this administration\u2019s leaders have decided that laws and norms of behavior that have held for a century or more don\u2019t apply to them. The Republican-led Congress has so far decided not to enforce them either. It\u2019s now up to the media, to outside organizations, and to whistleblowers to keep reporting the slide into kleptocracy to the public and to the courts, to make sure that remaining laws are enforced. It\u2019s up to the Democratic Party to follow the lead of opposition movements in other kleptocracies and to put corruption at the center of their arguments. Before it\u2019s too late, everyone who can do so must communicate what is happening: American government, American foreign policy, and American trade policy are slowly being transformed, not to benefit Americans but to benefit the president, his family, and his friends. Only voters can stop them.

Musk called Navarro 'moron' and 'dumber than a sack of bricks'. But now, the top White House trade adviser has denied any rift with the tech billionaire and even praised his DOGE work. Agencies Days after the spat, Navarro addressed the public spat with Elon Musk in an interview about the state of the economy and stock market Days after Elon Musk called US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro a \"moron\", the latter reportedly brushed off public humiliation from Tesla CEO. The trade adviser denied Sunday there are tensions between him and President Donald Trump's 'first buddy' and DOGE chief, NBC News reported. In an interview with NBC News, Peter Navarro said \"everything is fine with Elon\". \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse,\" he said with a laugh. Elon Musk, who is seemingly not happy with Trump Tariffs , publicly criticised Navarro last week. It started after responding to a post on him on Twitter, Elon Musk posted, and then deleted, a comment saying Navarro\u2019s PhD from Harvard is a \u201cbad thing,\u201d and that he hasn\u2019t \u201cbuilt sh*t.\u201d ALSO READ: 'Have you ever paid a tariff?': When Trump press secretary had a heated back-and-forth with reporter Elon Musk vs Peter Navarro Earlier this month, a verbal spat broke out between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, calling him a \"moron\" on social media as the SpaceX CEO split from the White House\u2019s tariffs plan. Musk's remarks were in response with Navarro during which the White House trade adviser discussed how Tesla\u2019s position as a \u201ccar assembler\u201d rather than a car manufacturer could be at odds with Trump\u2019s tariff policies. The comments come as Trump had announced widespread tariffs on a swath of countries. \u201cIn many cases, if you go to his Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets, which in the EV case are the batteries, come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan,\u201d Navarro had said. Live Events \u201cThe difference is, in our thinking and Elon\u2019s on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here.\u201d ALSO READ: 'Your presence making Trump, Elon very nervous': At Coachella, Bernie Sanders' big message to crowd In response to this, Musk said Navarro \u201cis truly a moron\u201d in an X post replying to a video of the comments being shared on the social media platform. \u201cWhat he says here is demonstrably false,\u201d he wrote, before calling Navarro \u201cPeter Retarrdo\u201d in another derogatory comment. Musk claimed \u201cTesla has the most American-made cars,\u201d in another series of X posts, adding that \u201cNavarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Peter Navarro denies rift with Elon Days after the spat, Navarro addressed the public spat with Elon Musk in an interview about the state of the economy and stock market. On Sunday, Navarro laughed off reports of tensions between the two men, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker: \u201cElon and I are agreeing. It\u2019s not an issue.\u201d He also praised Musk\u2019s work with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative that has led the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to lay off thousands of workers in the federal government as part of broader stated goal of targeting \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d ALSO READ: 'Most irritating person': Trump officials raise alarm over Elon Musk behaviour amid claims he is 'high' \u201cElon is doing a very good job with his team with waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Navarro said, echoing what he told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a tremendous contribution to America.\u201d Since Trump announced details of his tariffs at the start of April, Musk has broken with the administration, saying last weekend that he\u2019d like to see a \u201czero tariff situation\u201d between the United States and Europe. The White House, for its part, ignored Musk\u2019s comments. \u201cThese are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing.

By Allison Pecorin and Katherine Faulders April 14, 2025, 5:04 AM 7:48 President Donald Trump attends the Ultimate Fighting Championship with Elon Musk, April 12, 2025 in Miami. Nathan Howard/Reuters A new legislative push led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., is seeking to bar special government employees like tech billionaire and senior Trump adviser Elon Musk from communicating with government agencies that interface with their companies, and would require federal employees like Musk to meet new ethics requirements. Warren and Stansbury introduced a bill this week in the Senate and House, respectively, that would prevent special government employees (SGEs) like Musk \u2013 who lead companies worth $1 billion or more \u2013 from interacting with federal agencies that interface with his companies. SpaceX and Tesla together have received billions of dollars in government contracts over the past ten years. While the legislation introduced by Warren and Stansbury does not mention Musk or his companies by name, Musk\u2019s proximity to Trump in the early days of Trump\u2019s second term has made him a clear target of Democrats who have been outspoken about their opposition to Musk\u2019s key role in orchestrating massive cuts to the federal government, with little input from lawmakers. President Donald Trump attends the Ultimate Fighting Championship with Elon Musk, April 12, 2025 in Miami. Nathan Howard/Reuters The bill, titled the SGE Ethics Enforcement & Reform (SEER) Act of 2025, would create what the lawmakers are calling a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d that makes new provisions explicitly applicable to owners of a \u201clarge company,\u201d which the bill defines as any for-profit company making over $1 billion. Democrats, including Warren, have also raised concerns that Musk\u2019s companies could be unfairly benefitting from Musk\u2019s influence over Trump\u2019s policies. Since 2015, Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla have been awarded at least $24 billion in federal contracts , according to government spending data and public announcements. SpaceX has won nearly $23 million worth of contracts, which includes nearly $6 million that the Space Force recently awarded SpaceX for launch missions.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks with ABC News while appearing on 'This Week' April 13, 2025. ABC News The new bill would also implement a new requirement for government employees designated as \u201cspecial government employees\u201d to resolve conflicts of interest between their private-sector and governmental work during their service. Unlike other cabinet and high-level positions that are subject to congressional scrutiny via the Senate confirmation process, Musk, in his advisory role, is designated a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d a status Congress created in 1962 for temporary executive branch hires to perform limited duties for no more than 130 days. \u201cUnelected billionaire Elon Musk should not be acting as co-president of the United States and making $8 million a day from government contracts while he\u2019s at it. My new bill would crack down on conflicts of interest and create stronger ethics rules for Elon Musk and all Special Government Employees. Government should work for the American people, not billionaires lining their own pockets,\u201d Sen. Warren said in a statement provided to ABC News. Those working for the government as special government employees are not paid by the federal government and can continue to collect payment from outside entities while performing their work for the government, which Warren and Stansbury say runs the risk of creating possible conflicts of interest. The legislation aims to address those concerns by applying the same standard ethics rules that apply to regular federal employees to special government employees after they render 60 days of government service. These rules guide federal employees to avoid using their office for personal gain, to steer clear of conflicting financial interest, to maintain impartiality, to avoid outside activity or employment that could raise conflict of interest questions, and more.

Musk has appeared alongside Trump as recently as Thursday, when he was present at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. ABC News has previously reported that Musk could be taking a step back from his current role in the administration. His term would be up around the end of May but it had been widely rumored that the White House could take steps to keep him on or extend his employment status in some way. MORE: Trump\u2019s tariff policy is \u2018all chaos and corruption\u2019: Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u201cElon has done a fantastic job. Look, he's sitting here, and I don't care. I don't need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him,\u201d Trump told reporters during the meeting. Trump has acknowledged that Musk will eventually need to return to Tesla to run the company. However, when reports that Musk could depart the White House in May surfaced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refuted them. Elon Musk attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House, April 10, 2025 in Washington. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images \u201cElon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at [the Department of Government Efficiency] is complete,\" Leavitt said earlier this month. The bill introduced by Warren and Stansbury faces an uncertain future on Capitol Hill. It does not currently have a Republican co-sponsor and it\u2019s unlikely to get the GOP support it would need to move through either chamber of the Republican-controlled Congress. Many Republicans have praised Musk\u2019s efforts to slash federal spending and have remained hesitant to criticize Musk\u2019s work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, the bill comes as Democrats are looking to demonstrate that they are fighting against the Trump agenda on all fronts. Warren has been particularly focused on the Musk-led effort to dismantle federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that she was instrumental in creating.

New advance in artificial intelligence manufacturing could set the stage for robot factories on front lines. Patrick Tucker , Brookings | April 14, 2025 05:06 AM ET Robots Technology China By Patrick Tucker Science & Technology Editor April 14, 2025 05:06 AM ET Robots Technology China A new way to train factory robots could revolutionize how militaries make drones and other weapons, enabling high-volume manufacturing close to front lines. And beyond the battlefield, it shows a possible path forward in the next era of manufacturing, a topic central to the competition between the United States and China, which the National Defense Strategy calls the \u201cpacing challenge.\u201d The paper , published in the January issue of the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, lays out a transformative vision of AI-driven additive manufacturing, or AAM. Today\u2019s factory robots only are capable of a set number of rigid movements, are difficult to adapt to new tasks, and require highly specialized places on production floors. They can\u2019t see when they are lined up incorrectly, or when they make mistakes. The new system\u2014developed by an international team of researchers from California State University, Northridge; the National University of Singapore; NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2014uses highly-skilled engineers to train robots in a much fuller range of human-like movements, enabling them to perceive and (on a basic level) understand what they are doing. When combined with 3D printing technology, the framework opens up the possibility of complete end-to-end manufacturing of electronics, like the small drones re-shaping the battlefield in Ukraine. But it also addresses a key question at the root of the overarching power struggle between the United States and China: how to increase the manufacturing strength of the U.S. Related articles \u2018All hands on deck' moment in the US-China AI race: Pentagon's former digital chief Robot reality check: Crewed warplanes will remain vital for years, USAF general says Before President Donald Trump made re-shoring manufacturing a core focus of his presidency , the Biden White House undertook a series of different policy moves with the same goal\u2014including the use of smaller and more gradual tariffs accompanied by grants and other incentives . The Pentagon has launched several initiatives to reshore production of things like microelectronics, citing China's dominance in those sectors as a strategic liability. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which allocates over $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, reflects bipartisan recognition that industrial capability underpins military and economic strength. Without secure, domestic access to critical technologies, the U.S. risks operational delays, compromised weapons systems, and diminished deterrence capacity in future conflicts. But the United States suffers from a critical lack of skilled workers to meet those goals. And institutes like NIST, as well as industry heads, forecast that even with government investment, building that workforce would take at least seven years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik said this month that robotics and automation could play a key role in a U.S.-led manufacturing renaissance. And several American robotics companies are pushing for a national strategy to promote manufacturing automation. However, the current state of factory robotics lags behind hopes for a quick transition to factory automation. A 2019 report from Boston Consulting Group points out the obvious: manufacturing robots lack the adaptiveness and dexterity of human workers, and robots lack the problem-solving abilities that are still key to actually producing things. That\u2019s changed little since 2019, as revealed by the controversies and embarrassing public demonstrations of the Optimus robot developed by Tesla. Questions about whether Optimus is indeed autonomous or just an elaborate human-controlled puppet point to larger uncertainties about exactly how to make truly humanistic robots. That\u2019s why this new paper is so significant. Traditional manufacturing methods, even robots, \u201cneed a lot of well-trained engineers,\u201d said co-author Bingbing Li of California State University, Northridge. And even the most advanced 3D printers often require manual steps for design input, process selection, or post-processing. The paper\u2019s AAM vision includes end-to-end autonomy: from computer-assisted design model preparation and nesting to scheduling, process optimization, and post-print machining\u2014all managed by a fleet of collaborating robots or drones. This integration will be particularly important for manufacturing in outer space, hence the interest and support from NASA. Li said he\u2019s also been in contact with military contractors and the Defense Department\u2019s office of Operational Testing and Evaluation for a defense-related project that could begin in May, if final approvals are granted. AAM relies heavily on what the authors call sensor-integrated design: the use of many sensors of visible light, heat, and other phenomena to create a sort of perception in a software \u201cbrain.\u201d That brain, which differentiates tomorrow\u2019s factory robots from today\u2019s, will have four layers: a \u201cknowledge layer\u201d at the base of the model collects data from sensors, simulations, and past operations. A \u201cgenerative solution layer\u201d uses AI tools like large language models and knowledge graphs to model decision-making. An \u201coperational layer\u201d implements decisions on hardware, software, and robotic systems; and a \u201ccognitive layer\u201d empowers machines with agency , allowing them to reason, act, and even reflect. \u201cWithin this [cognitive] layer, AI agents act as high-level controllers, assessing the skill pool in the operational layer to select appropriate skills for task execution based on the current state,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThese agents are responsible for planning and executing optimal actions, engaging in a lifelong learning process that enhances their expertise through continuous reflection and learning.\u201d That process of learning is similar to the way humans interact with large language models. At first, the results are generic and error-prone, but over time, the relationship between the trainer and the machine produces a type of human-like intelligence that can be replicated across multiple robots. \u201cWe hope to minimize the human operation down to or close to zero, because the whole process itself, we want to automate,\u201d Li said. The degree to which some manufacturing processes can be automated will depend greatly on the complexity of the thing that is being produced and how quickly AI systems can learn to adapt to new, unexpected events. Li said human experts will still play a crucial role in that process, but more akin to supervisors than operators. Instead of doing the manual tasks beyond a robot\u2019s ken, the human will help the robots develop, improve, and validate ways to deal with the unexpected. Ideally, the AI would become smart enough to actually consider how to improve on human designs, via what the authors call \u201cgenerative design tools,\u201d including diffusion models , 3D reconstruction, and neural radiance fields . NeRFs extrapolate depth and volume from pictures, the same way the brain does, to automate the design and creation of 3D objects from mere sketches or photos. \u201cThese advancements pave the way for 3D content creation, potentially bringing us closer to the realization of \u2018What you think is what you get,\u2019\u201d the authors write\u200b. \u201cBy exploring vast design spaces, these tools generate innovative solutions that traditional methods might overlook.\u201d In a military context, this means a soldier in the field could scan a broken part and an AI-enhanced system could redesign and print a replacement with minimal oversight\u2014a power that could vastly reduce manning and logistics needs at the front. The Defense Department, including DARPA, have increasingly emphasized secure, scalable, and on-demand manufacturing for contested logistics environments. The AAM method of closed-loop manufacturing using multiple sensors, feeding data to a layered intelligence, offering a roadmap for not only smarter production but resilient, adaptive manufacturing capabilities that could redefine the industrial front lines. But beyond bases, the framework shows a path forward for moving manufacturing back to the United States. That has implications for the broader race with China, which wields its industrial capacity not only for economic dominance but to produce vast weapons stockpiles. Then-Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Bill LaPlante noted this challenge in October 2023: \u201cToday, the U.S. is in a technological and economic race to maintain its manufacturing edge, particularly as it concerns critical defense systems, such as satellites, advanced munitions and communications technologies.\u201d But the advancement also highlights other serious challenges standing in the way of a more automated manufacturing future, namely that China is the market-share leader in key components that robots need, such as sensors and actuators. Additionally, China has much more access to the materials that would be required to print and build products\u2014including weapons\u2014in robot-run factories. Robots will enable the United States to build more things. But they won\u2019t build themselves.

Credit: BEYOND EXPO Tesla has de-facto suspended sales and marketing of its imported Model S and Model X electric vehicles in China, which have faced retaliatory 125% import levies imposed by the Chinese government amid an escalating trade war with the US. New orders for the two Tesla flagship models are no longer accepted on its Chinese website by the US automaker, according to a Reuters report. This comes two days after the Trump administration upped the levies on China on top of an existing 20% tariff related to the drug fentanyl. China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024, which accounted for less than 0.3% of Tesla\u2019s total deliveries of 657,102 units in China last year, according to figures revealed by Li Yanwei, an analyst with the China Auto Dealers Association.

That\u2019s not the whole story By Chris Isidore , CNN 7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Mon April 14, 2025 Link Copied! Follow: Auto industry See your latest updates Employees install parts on a door at the Mercedes-Benz factory in Vance, Alabama. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images CNN \u2014 Much of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff rhetoric has been about restoring factory jobs \u2014 particularly auto jobs \u2014 that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cAmerican steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen \u2026 they really suffered gravely,\u201d Trump said during his April 2 rollout of new tariffs. \u201cForeign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.\u201d Trump promises that his 25% tariffs on all imported cars will raise costs enough to bring a flood of new auto plant construction, and thus auto jobs, back to US shores. But the loss of auto jobs in the US, especially across the upper Midwest, is a complex story beyond trade deals and shifting production to low-wage countries. There was also the fact that American car buyers abandoned the three Detroit automakers for foreign competitors following years of questionable quality and value. And most importantly, the introduction of automation, which drastically reduced the hours needed to assemble a car . \u201cWhat you see is that the real story in the auto sector is automation,\u201d said Jason Miller, a business professor at Michigan State University and an auto industry expert. One of the reasons the production shift to Mexico gets so much attention from those angry about assembly plants and auto parts factories closing, Miller says, is due to timing. The introduction of more robots, and the resulting job loss, \u201cwas especially severe during the exact time period that trade liberalization took place.\u201d And the situation is not nearly as dire as Trump makes it out to be. In fact, there are more workers building cars in US assembly plants today than when NAFTA took effect in 1994, according to the US Labor Department data. They also built roughly twice as many cars as Mexico and Canada combined last year, according to S&P Global Mobility. Experts widely agree that the trade deals are a distant third cause of auto factory closings, behind automation and market share losses. Tariffs are not going to reverse those factors. Big Three lose market share Automation revolutionized car manufacturing. It cut the time it took to build a car from about 50 hours of labor in 1988 down to about 18-20 hours by 2005, said Laurie Harbour, partner at auto industry consultant Wipfli, which studies auto plant efficiency. \u201cAt the same time, (the Detroit automakers) were dramatically losing market share,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cSo those two things combined \u2013 I\u2019m not making as many vehicles, and I\u2019m making them in like half the time \u2013 is what led to the plant closings.\u201d Up through the early 1970s, more than 80% of US car sales went to the traditional Big Three American carmakers \u2014 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which is today owned by Stellantis, according to Wards Automotive, which reports on the auto industry. That market dominance started to decline in the face of Japanese imports. By 2007, the Big Three lost a majority of US sales for the first time, and in 2024, they made up only 38% of the US market combined. That loss of market share was greatly self-inflicted, said Patrick Anderson, president of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan think tank. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that deficient quality, uninspired design and bad labor relations of 20 to 30 years ago caused lasting wounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US automakers have recovered from much of that. But before it got there, it did end up bankrupting GM and Chrysler.\u201d And despite building better quality cars in recent years, those American brands haven\u2019t been able to win back many of the buyers it lost to import brands, he said. Foreign brands make many cars here While foreign automakers were winning market share, they were also building their own US plants. But not all auto jobs are made equal. Most of those new plants were nonunion factories built in lower-wage \u201cright-to-work\u201d states in the South. Currently, the only exception is a Chattanooga, Tennessee, Volkswagen plant that voted to join the United Auto Workers union just a year ago. Last year, Asian and European brands built 4.9 million vehicles at US plants, edging out the 4.6 million built by Ford, GM and Stellantis, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Tesla built an additional 648,000 at its two US plants. That is why even with automation and market share losses, there are more US auto plant assembly jobs today as there were 30 years ago. While assembly jobs are slightly above their 1994 levels there has been a decline in auto parts jobs. That\u2019s significant \u2014 nearly twice as many auto workers build parts as perform the final assembly. Many of those parts jobs disappeared due to production shifts to Mexico or automation in American plants. And new US auto parts jobs followed the new assembly plants to nonunion states in the South: Michigan has lost half of its 220,000 auto parts jobs since the 1990s, while auto parts jobs in Alabama have more than doubled, according to Miller, the business professor at Michigan State University. Even so, there is no doubt that NAFTA led to a boom in assembly plants and auto parts factories in Mexico. Today, virtually every major global automaker has a plant in Mexico to serve the US market. Last year, Mexican plants built 4 million vehicles and shipped 2.5 million of them to American customers, according to S&P Global Mobility. An employee transports test parts for a Volkswagen Tiguan inside the company's plant in Puebla, Mexico, on October 13, 2016. Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg/Getty Images Under NAFTA, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump negotiated in his first term to take NAFTA\u2019s place, automakers operated as if the three countries were a single market. They built cars and trucks by moving parts and vehicles freely across the borders. But more cars have also been imported from Asia and Europe. Today, South Korea is the second-largest source of car imports behind Mexico, sending 1.4 million cars to US dealers. Japan is right behind with 1.3 million followed by Canada with 1 million and Germany a distant fifth with 430,000 exports, according to S&P Global Mobility. US auto industry still strong Despite its problems, US auto plants still dominate the North American market and are major players globally, unlike other sectors such as textiles and semiconductors. Last year, 10.2 millions cars \u2014 or two-thirds of the North American output \u2014 were assembled at US plants, according to S&P Global Mobility. That\u2019s enough to account for 55% of the cars purchased in the United States, with 1 million exported to other countries, including Canada and Mexico. US car production is currently down only 14% since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, according to Wards Automotive. That\u2019s even as car production in Mexico has soared 272% since then. Despite the arguments made by the Trump administration, tariffs won\u2019t relocate auto plants in foreign countries to America anytime soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a minimum of a two-year exercise to pull a plant out of Mexico and move it here,\u201d said Harbour. US assembly plants with excess capacity can\u2019t necessarily start producing the additional models now being built elsewhere. And reopening a plant that has been closed can take years. Even if new auto plants are built, they would need to be highly automated to compete with lower-wage Mexican plants. \u201cYou will not see US manufacturing employment numbers go back to the 1990 level due to automation,\u201d said Miller. Even members of the Trump administration are talking about automation in new plants, which would mean fewer jobs in any returning plants than the factories of the past. \u201cHere\u2019s the key. Factories now can use robotics,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a recent interview on CNBC . \u201cSo American workers can be much more efficient with robotics. You\u2019re going to see the greatest surge in \u2026 teaching people how to be robotics mechanics \u2026 it\u2019s a great paying job and it requires a high school education.\u201d It\u2019s more likely that parts plants will shift back to America than assembly plants, said Harbour. But that doesn\u2019t mean there will be significantly more jobs at those factories. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see some job growth. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a jobs boom,\u201d said Harbour. \u201cIt\u2019s being portrayed to be much larger than I think it will be.\u201d Related Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback CNN Business Videos Comedy Central Video Jon Stewart mocks Trump\u2019s \u2018Pinterest vibe\u2019 Oval Office aesthetic 1:30 Apr 15, 2025 Andrew Harnik/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Video Former FTC chair explains how to prove if a company is a monopoly 1:30 Apr 15, 2025 CNN Video \u2018I\u2019m very optimistic\u2019: Steel company owner tells CNN tariffs will help them 3:28 Apr 15, 2025 CNN Video Top economist predicts a recession in weeks if Trump\u2019s trade war continues 1:18 Apr 14, 2025 Ad Feedback Ad Feedback", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/14/business/us-auto-jobs-history-free-trade-automation/index.html", "source": "CNN", "published_at": "2025-04-14T09:00:36"}, {"id": 370, "title": "Unlock YouTube on Apple CarPlay: The No-Jailbreak Method You Need to Know", "content": "Unlock YouTube on Apple CarPlay - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer Have you ever wanted to watch YouTube or access streaming apps like Netflix directly on your car\u2019s infotainment system without modifying its original setup? The solution lies in external devices that unlock advanced features such as YouTube, Netflix, and app access through Apple CarPlay or Android Auto\u2014all without requiring a jailbreak. These devices offer a seamless way to enhance your in-car entertainment system while preserving your vehicle\u2019s original functionality. The video below from HotshotTek explores how these devices work, their features, and why they are a practical choice for upgrading your driving experience. Watch this video on YouTube . Understanding External Devices for In-Car Entertainment External devices designed for in-car entertainment come in two primary categories, each offering unique benefits: Android-based devices: These devices provide full Android functionality, allowing access to apps like YouTube, Netflix, and the Google Play Store directly on your car\u2019s infotainment screen. They essentially transform your car\u2019s system into a smart device. Wireless CarPlay adapters: These adapters are designed to convert wired CarPlay systems into wireless ones. In addition to eliminating the need for cables, they often include features like streaming capabilities and enhanced audio performance. Both types of devices are compatible with vehicles that support wired CarPlay, making them an accessible and cost-effective solution for drivers looking to expand their car\u2019s multimedia capabilities without replacing the head unit. Features and Benefits of External Devices These devices bring a wealth of functionality to your car\u2019s infotainment system, transforming it into a versatile multimedia hub. Key features include: Streaming access: Enjoy popular platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Apple Music directly from your car\u2019s display. App downloads: With Google Play Store support, you can install additional apps to suit your preferences. Connectivity options: Many devices offer built-in LTE connectivity via a SIM card or mobile hotspot, making sure uninterrupted streaming on the go. Cross-platform compatibility: These devices work seamlessly with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay systems, catering to a wide range of users. Mobile gaming support: While console streaming isn\u2019t available, some devices allow for casual gaming, adding another layer of entertainment. Whether you\u2019re embarking on a long road trip or navigating your daily commute, these features can significantly enhance your driving experience by providing entertainment and convenience. Preserving Your OEM System One of the standout advantages of these external devices is their ability to retain your car\u2019s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) system. Unlike aftermarket head units, which can be costly and may disrupt your car\u2019s settings, these devices integrate seamlessly with your existing setup. By keeping the OEM system intact, you benefit from: Preserved car settings: Features like climate controls, ambient lighting, and other factory settings remain unaffected. High-quality displays and audio: OEM systems often offer superior resolution and sound quality compared to aftermarket alternatives. Full compatibility: These devices work harmoniously with your car\u2019s built-in features, making sure a smooth user experience. This makes them particularly appealing for older vehicles, where replacing the head unit might not be practical or cost-effective. By opting for an external device, you can enjoy modern entertainment features without compromising your car\u2019s original design. Considerations and Limitations While these devices offer numerous advantages, it\u2019s important to be aware of their limitations to make an informed decision: Vehicle compatibility: These devices are only compatible with cars that support wired CarPlay, limiting their use in some models. Variable audio quality: The sound performance may differ depending on the specific device you choose, so research is essential. Data usage: Streaming relies on cellular data, which could lead to increased costs if not monitored carefully. Despite these challenges, the benefits of these devices often outweigh the drawbacks, especially for drivers seeking a cost-effective way to upgrade their car\u2019s entertainment system. Who Benefits the Most? These devices are particularly advantageous for specific groups of drivers, including: Owners of older vehicles: Drivers with older models, such as those equipped with Ford Sync 3 or earlier Kia systems, can modernize their infotainment experience without replacing the head unit. Road trip enthusiasts: Long journeys become more enjoyable with access to streaming platforms and other entertainment options. Audio-focused users: Those who prioritize sound quality can benefit from devices designed to enhance audio performance. If you fall into any of these categories, these devices can provide a significant upgrade to your in-car experience, making every drive more enjoyable and engaging. The Future of In-Car Entertainment The landscape of in-car entertainment is evolving rapidly. There is growing speculation that Apple and Google may eventually integrate streaming platforms like YouTube directly into CarPlay and Android Auto. Some automakers, including BMW, Tesla, and Mercedes, have already introduced built-in YouTube functionality in their infotainment systems. However, until these features become standard across all vehicles, external devices remain the most practical and accessible option for enhancing your car\u2019s entertainment capabilities without altering its original design. External devices offer a straightforward and effective way to unlock advanced features like YouTube and streaming apps on your car\u2019s infotainment system. By retaining your OEM setup, they provide a seamless and cost-efficient solution for improving in-car entertainment, particularly for older vehicles. Whether you\u2019re planning a road trip or simply looking to make your daily commute more enjoyable, these devices can transform your driving experience into something far more engaging and convenient.

Our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are critical to our success.\u201d That\u2019s an extract from the obligatory risks section of a recent annual report from Block, the fintech firm founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Who has sparked a big debate this weekend by tweeting \u201cdelete all IP law\u201d on X . \u201cI agree,\u201d replied X owner Elon Musk . The most recent annual report from one of his other companies, Tesla, notes that it seeks \u201cto protect the underlying intellectual property rights\u201d of its technology innovations and designs through patents, trademarks, copyrights and other measures. Unlike another Musk venture, SpaceX \u2013 202 patents at the time of writing since you ask \u2013 it isn\u2019t rocket science to point quizzically at tech moguls calling for the system of IP protections that helped them make their billions to be thrown in the bin. But still, it\u2019s a bit on the nose. Dorsey\u2019s response to a number of replies to his tweet suggests that his view is partly because he thinks that \u201cexecution and speed matters more\u201d; partly about the approach in China (\u201cdo you want to have a chance at competing with them?\u201d; and partly a distrust of rightsholders. \u201cCreativity is what currently separates us, and the current system is limiting that, and putting the payments disbursement into the hands of gatekeepers who aren\u2019t paying out fairly,\u201d went one reply on the latter point. We\u2019d normally say \u2018well, this\u2019ll be awkward the next time Block subsidiary Tidal is negotiating licensing deals with music rightsholders, who have some quite different views on IP law eh?\u2019 at this point. But Dorsey and his company\u2019s interest in the music-streaming business seems to have dwindled away already . The serious point: this is a snapshot of an ever-louder public discussion, where some (not all) powerful people in the tech industry want to frame copyright as a barrier to innovation and growth. It\u2019s at the heart of consultations on how AI training should be regulated, for example. Music rightsholders certainly don\u2019t have a spotless record when it comes to fair payouts, but sweeping away copyright protection would benefit musicians far less than it would benefit, well, tech moguls. But the challenge for the music industry is to push back on the zero-sum analysis that copyright and IP laws can\u2019t co-exist with innovation. In fact, they should drive it. Dorsey is clearly thinking about technological innovation: he doesn\u2019t seem to care much about innovation in art and culture. But a world where IP laws are deleted en masse feels a bleak prospect for both.

[Mike Blake/Reuters] By Amy Sherman | PolitiFact Published On 14 Apr 2025 14 Apr 2025 United States President Donald Trump and his allies have offered a solution to avoiding price hikes because of his car tariffs : buy American. Trump told NBC News on March 29 that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if foreign car manufacturers raised prices in response to tariffs. \u201cI hope they raise their prices because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have plenty.\u201d The administration\u2019s 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect on April 3, and an additional tariff on imported auto parts is set to take effect on May 3. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their costs are often passed down to consumers through higher prices. Fox News host Jesse Watters made a similar statement to Trump on April 3: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried cars are going to cost more, buy American.\u201d Watters cited a clip of Ford Motor Co\u2019s promotion to temporarily give customers its employee rate on cars. Bernie Moreno, a Republican senator from Ohio who owned multiple car dealerships before taking office, echoed Trump in an April 2 CNN interview. Advertisement Moreno said the \u201conly ones that are mostly hurt are the cars that are made overseas, exclusively, and are shipped into the United States. The ultra-luxury cars.\u201d However, this is contradicted by an analysis by Cox Automotive, a research firm, which found that the \u201c25 percent tariff on imported vehicles will apply to nearly 80 percent of vehicles priced under $30,000\u201d. The analysis cited models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Trax and Trailblazer, Nissan Sentra and Honda HR-V. Senator Moreno added that among \u201cmainstream cars \u2013 a Honda, a Toyota, a Subaru, a Ford, a Chevy \u2013 if one car goes up in price, because there\u2019s a tariff, that person will just buy the other one that doesn\u2019t have a tariff, which is your American-made automobile\u201d. Many car experts said it is not so simple to avoid price increases by buying US cars, because those assembled in the US also use imported parts. \u201cThe concept of an American-made car with all parts from the US is a fictional tale,\u201d said Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey will tariff those parts.\u201d Car companies rely on imported parts to varying degrees. For example, the Tesla Model Y has 70 percent of the value of its parts made in the US or Canada. For the Ford F-150, it is 45 percent. The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists have said it is unlikely that high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans. Advertisement In response to a PolitiFact email asking about Moreno\u2019s statement on US-made cars, a spokesperson for the senator attacked the publication and provided no answers to its questions about cars and tariffs. The White House, when contacted, said that some auto parts are exempted from tariffs. Many US car manufacturers use imported parts Moreno said that US-assembled cars that get parts from Mexico and Canada will be \u201ccompletely tariff-free\u201d if they comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump\u2019s administration negotiated in 2018. But many auto parts used in the US come from countries other than Mexico and Canada. Jason Miller, a Michigan State University supply chain management professor, examined auto tariff data and told PolitiFact that it showed Mexico \u201cclearly top of the list\u201d for car parts imported into the US. China is second (because of lithium-ion batteries), Japan is fourth, South Korea is fifth and Germany is sixth. Miller said Trump\u2019s other tariffs on steel and aluminium mean that even if a car were 100 percent assembled from only domestic components, costs would still rise because steel and aluminium prices are increasing in the US. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t oversimplifying things, they are outright lying,\u201d Miller said about people saying car shoppers can buy all US-made cars. Also, not all auto parts from Mexico comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, so those are being tariffed, too, he said. Amy R Broglin-Peterson, a Michigan State University expert on supply chain management, said, \u201cAll vehicles use at least some percentage of foreign parts \u2013 period. There is no vehicle model that uses 100 percent American-manufactured parts.\u201d Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported on April 4 that, at first glance, Ford is best positioned to weather tariffs because 80 percent of its cars, pick-up trucks and SUVs sold in the US are manufactured domestically, and so are many of the parts. Many components of Ford\u2019s F-150s, such as alternators and wheels, come from other countries and, starting in May, those parts could face a new 25 percent tax. The Wall Street Journal wrote, \u201cSo even though Ford\u2019s trucks are built in the American heartland, import tariffs could jack up the average price by thousands of dollars\u201d. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) publishes data about the US and Canadian content by value of the parts used to assemble passenger motor vehicles in the US and foreign countries. The data shows that some Toyota car lines built in the US, such as Corolla, include at least 25 percent value of parts imported from Japan. A Toyota spokesperson said that 47 percent of vehicles the company sold in the US in 2024 were built in the US. USA Today analysed NHTSA data for multiple automakers and found that \u201cfor all models assembled and available for sale in the US, 47 percent of the parts (by value) originated from the US or Canada\u201d. A Cox Automotive spokesperson said that the average US-made vehicle has about 50 percent of its parts or components by value imported. Car prices could rise because of Trump\u2019s tariffs The long-term effect of the tariffs on the car industry us difficult to predict. Cox Automotive predicted strong sales until the pre-tariff inventory declines. Advertisement \u201cBut all roads lead to this fact: In the coming months and years, as new tariffs settle into place, vehicle prices in the US are expected to increase,\u201d Cox wrote in an April 4 market insights report. Cox predicted that vehicles affected by these tariffs could see prices increase by 10 percent to 15 percent, and at least a 5 percent increase for vehicles not subject to the full tariff. \u201cProduction disruptions and declines could be a reality this summer, especially as automakers and suppliers work to align practices with the new rules,\u201d Cox wrote. As the price of cars manufactured in foreign countries rises, producers of competing US models with fewer imported parts will raise their prices, not dollar for dollar, but perhaps 40 cents per dollar, Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted. \u201cUS auto manufacturers are hurting, and they will raise prices where they can,\u201d Hufbauer said.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

(Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Getty Images Trefis Tesla stock appears relatively expensive , making it a costly option at its current price of around $250. The company faces several risks. The U.S.\u2019s imposition of tariffs on all imports threatens to trigger a recession, while growing tensions between the U.S. and China, along with potential brand damage due to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s political involvement, could further impact Tesla. The stock remains nearly 47% below its December 2024 peak, and more downside could follow, as Tesla has historically underperformed the broader market in downturns. For instance, during the 2022 inflation shock, Tesla stock plunged 73.6% compared to a 25.4% drop in the S&P 500. This suggests further downside is possible. Separately, want exposure to AI? Should you Buy MSFT Stock At $400? Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries have declined, with the company reporting 336,681 deliveries in Q1 2025, down 13% year-over-year. The situation could deteriorate further. The U.S.-China trade war is intensifying, with President Trump raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, while China responded with an 84% duty on American imports. Although Tesla manufactures in China at its Shanghai plant, potential anti-American sentiment and Elon Musk\u2019s perceived alignment with Trump may affect sales. China accounted for 21% of Tesla\u2019s revenue in the past year. The Shanghai facility, with a capacity of over 950,000 vehicles annually, produced over half of Tesla\u2019s 2024 shipments. Reduced sales and underutilization may squeeze margins, especially as competition from Chinese automakers surges with high-tech, competitively priced vehicles. The U.S. market outlook is more mixed. Tesla may benefit from its upcoming Robotaxi launch in Austin and a refreshed Model Y. However, Elon Musk\u2019s political involvement, particularly his role in the Trump administration, is alienating progressive consumers. While the new tariffs give Tesla a cost edge over competitors reliant on Mexican production, Tesla also sources many components from China and Mexico, potentially increasing its own costs. In Europe, the situation is grim. Tesla's Q1 market share in 15 European countries dropped to 9.3% from 17.9% a year ago, following Musk\u2019s support of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party during February elections. Fundamentally, Tesla\u2019s metrics don't justify its high valuation. Despite strong operating performance and financial stability, as outlined below, investors seeking lower volatility might consider the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio , which has outpaced the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception.

In the US-China trade war, Beijing needs to stay ahead of the competition. This surprising move threatens to disrupt international manufacturing and security operations as countries scramble to find alternative suppliers. Rare Earths: The Backbone of Modern Technology US-China Trade War: Beijing Halts Rare Earth Exports, Affecting Global According to The New York Times , China dominates the global rare earth market, producing nearly 90% of the world's supply of these 17 essential elements. Rare earths are critical to the development of electric vehicles, smartphones, renewable energy technologies, advanced robotics, and military hardware such as missiles and drones. Among the rare earths now restricted are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium-related compounds. These elements are particularly hard to source and refine, making China's export halt a direct threat to global production capabilities. Export Crackdown Hits US and Allied Industries The new export controls come in response to a sharp tariff hike imposed by former US President Donald Trump, which took effect on April 2. In retaliation, Beijing introduced sweeping export restrictions on key minerals, magnets, and advanced materials. The measures target both raw materials and finished products, making it even harder for companies to find quick replacements. Many Chinese ports have already halted shipments of these materials, as Beijing crafts a long-term regulatory framework. Once finalized, this new system could permanently block exports to certain foreign companies, including US military contractors and tech manufacturers. Supply Chain Disruption Looms for Auto and Semiconductor Giants From Tesla to Boeing, and from chipmakers to renewable energy developers, a wide array of industries could feel the pressure. Permanent magnets, in particular, are indispensable for electric vehicle motors, aircraft systems, and industrial automation. Analysts warn that the US and other Western nations lack sufficient domestic production to meet demand. America currently operates just one rare earth mine, with most of its supply still dependent on Chinese exports. DigiTimes reported that the rare earth export controls also threatened semiconductor manufacturers in South Korea . Originally published on Tech Times \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The Tesla CEO has spearheaded efforts to reduce the deficit by at least $1 trillion, held private meetings on Capitol Hill, and even attended cabinet meetings. However, Musk's growing influence in Washington may become a central factor in a Democratic resurgence in the 2026 midterms. In recent weeks, Musk's approval ratings have plummeted. A recent poll conducted by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies and Harris, which surveyed 2,746 registered voters between March 26 and 27, found that 49 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, compared to just 39 percent who view him favorably. This is a sharp decline from February, when 44 percent said they viewed Musk favorably, and an equal percentage viewed him unfavorably. Similarly, a YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between April 5-8 among 1,563 registered voters, showed a drop in Musk's favorability from 44 percent in January to 40 percent. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters view him unfavorably, an increase from 48 percent in January. Pollster Nate Silver 's tracker also shows Musk's approval rating deep underwater, with 54 percent of Americans viewing him unfavorably and 40 percent viewing him favorably.

Since joining the Trump administration, Musk has aggressively pushed for policies aimed at slashing government spending, rolling back regulations, and downsizing the federal workforce, all in his role as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These efforts have triggered a series of legal challenges and widespread public backlash. Just last week, thousands gathered in a series of global \"Hands Off!\" protests, expressing outrage over Musk's attempts to gut federal agencies and cut the federal workforce. Hundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations have also taken place, urging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and shares of the company's stock in protest of Musk. In March, its market value fell by 4 percent. Musk's political clout was also shaken this month by the defeat of Brad Schimel, the Trump-backed judicial candidate, who lost to Susan Crawford by a 9-point margin in Wisconsin, despite Musk pouring millions of dollars into backing the Republican candidate. Since then, political analysts and GOP strategists have pointed to Musk's increasingly polarizing image as a key factor in the loss.

Alishia Abodunde/Getty Images \"It was clear that his efforts to take a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are deeply unpopular with the majority of voters,\" Democratic strategist Doug Gordon told Newsweek . In response, a group of 77 House Democrats, led by Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Greg Casar, is launching a campaign to force Musk to resign from his position at DOGE by May 30, saying it is \"for the good of the country.\" Amid Musk's declining popularity, Democrats are starting to see a path to recovery in the 2026 midterms after the party faced a humiliating defeat in the 2024 election, with Trump improving his vote share in almost every state, and the Republicans taking the House and the Senate . Pollster Adam Carlson suggested that Democrats could adopt a strategy similar to the one Republicans used in 2010, when they targeted then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , whose low favorability ratings made her a more effective target than President Barack Obama , who was still relatively popular. Carlson argued that Musk, much like Pelosi at the time, could become a potent symbol for Democratic opposition, particularly if his favorability continues to decline while Trump's approval remains stable due to the loyalty of his base. However, recent polls have shown Trump's approval rating declining as well. \"Musk could serve as a powerful 'bonus bogeyman' for Democrats, particularly in tight races across the House, Senate, and state-level contests,\" Carlson said. \"As we saw in Wisconsin last week, Musk is so electorally toxic that just the idea of him might be enough.\" Carlson also noted that while Democrats should focus their attacks on Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms, \"having that bonus bogeyman who is loathed by swing voters could be pivotal in key House, Senate, governor, and downballot races.\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, agreed, telling Newsweek : \"Elon Musk will certainly have a political target on his back in the 2026 midterms. The fact that DOGE is waning in popularity, and many voters resent Musk trying to buy elections with his wealth, will serve as energizers for the Democratic base.\" \"Musk does offer the Democrats an advantage in campaigning in that he is increasingly unpopular and his wealth is very otherworldly to most Americans,\" G. Elliott Morris, former director of 538 for ABC News, said. Democratic strategist Christy Setzer pointed to recent protests and strong special election results as signs of rising Democratic momentum. Setzer sees Musk as a powerful symbol for Democrats to rally against, particularly if they tie him directly to Trump, framing both as a unified threat. \"There's a clear and obvious upside in going after Musk\u2014just ask the Wisconsin electorate, who showed him the door in dramatic fashion just last week,\" Setzer said. Indeed, in Wisconsin's recent Supreme Court election, the Democrats framed their victory as a repudiation of Musk. Following their success, DNC Chair Ken Martin issued a statement criticizing both Trump and Musk for undermining key social programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, all in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. He also blamed their economic policies\u2014especially the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u2014for eroding consumer confidence and fueling fears of a recession. On a recent episode of the Hacks On Tap podcast, former Obama-era adviser David Axelrod characterized the recent Wisconsin election as \"a referendum on Elon Musk,\" not Trump. \"Democrats see it as more fruitful to go after Musk,\" Axelrod explained.

Scott Olson/Getty Images However, Gift warned that while Musk and DOGE's declining popularity could energize the Democratic base, the party still needs a compelling, positive agenda to make significant inroads. \"Democrats still need a positive message about what they stand for. Like in November's election, simply running against Trump or against Musk won't be enough for Democrats to make the kind of gains in the House and Senate they hope for in 2026.\" Morris echoed this caution, noting that it is unlikely to repair the party's credibility on key issues such as crime, inflation, and trade, where voters still express skepticism. \"I do not think the backlash to him alone will be enough to repair the party's credibility where it was before [Joe] Biden took office,\" Morris told Newsweek . \"Americans tell pollsters they do not trust Democrats to handle crime, the economy, inflation, guns, trade, etc. Just fighting against Musk will not fix all of those problems for them.\" In order to retake the House and the Senate in the 2026 midterms, the Democrats face an uphill battle. Since Trump won against his opponent Kamala Harris , the Democratic Party has seen record-low approval ratings. According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990. There was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Some recent polls have also shown that Trump's approval rating among Democrats is actually rising, indicating that some voters may be less hostile to him than in the past. In a recent interview on Real Time with Bill Mahe r, California Governor Gavin Newsom described his party's brand as \"toxic.\" \"Democrats, we tend to be a little more judgmental than we should be,\" Newsom added. \"We need to own our mistakes. We need to own what's wrong with our party.\" But Setzer argued that her party's popularity has declined because it has been weak in the face of Trump\u2014something that has frustrated voters. \"Democrats aren't standing up strongly against the biggest threat to our economy and our democracy in history,\" she told Newsweek . Looking ahead to the 2026 midterms, Setzer argues that if Democrats want to use the unpopularity of figures like Musk as part of their campaign, they must connect that negative image directly to Trump. By doing so, they can use the public's dislike of Musk to also weaken the president's support. Setzer believes this strategy\u2014attacking both at the same time\u2014can help diminish Trump's power and mobilize voters against him. \"Democrats, r anyone who wishes to stop Trump, need to make sure they're tying Musk's toxicity to Trump and taking him down in the process,\" Setzer said. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

By Reuters | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:19 IST Photo Credit: Reuters Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015 Highlights Musk sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman last year He accused OpenAI of straying from its founding mission OpenAI was founded to develop AI for the good for humanity Advertisement A dozen former OpenAI employees filed a legal brief on Friday backing co-founder Elon Musk's lawsuit aimed at keeping the non-profit status of OpenAI, marking the latest development in the dispute over the future of the artificial intelligence firm. Corporate leaders want to give investors control, drawing a host of concerns and a lawsuit from Musk and others who say business interests must be subordinated to humanitarian goals. Last year, Musk , who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman , accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission - to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations. ChatGPT Can Now Remember and Reference Your Previous Conversations In their federal court filing on Friday, the former employees contended that stripping the nonprofit of its controlling role would \"fundamentally violate\" its mission, as it would lose oversight of the for-profit AI development entity. The former OpenAI employees, who said they held technical and leadership roles in the company, said the nonprofit's oversight was crucial to its overall strategy, and that while they worked at the firm, OpenAI executives had emphasised repeatedly the structure's importance in OpenAI's ability to execute on its mission. The structure also helped with recruitment, and many employees joined because they were inspired by the nonprofit's mission, they said. OpenAI has argued that it needs to remove the nonprofit's controlling role in order to raise funds from investors. The nonprofit will retain a stake in OpenAI that will become increasingly valuable as the company grows, enriching the nonprofit with deep resources to carry out its mission, the company argues. OpenAI Could Buy Jony Ive and Sam Altman\u2019s AI Devices Startup In a statement, OpenAI said the transition would not affect its mission: \u201cOur Board has been very clear: our nonprofit isn't going anywhere and our mission will remain the same.\u201d Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Musk's opposition to the change in structure led to the current suit, and the two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. Recently Musk also went on to create his own AI firm, xAI , in 2023, and Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor. OpenAI, meanwhile, faces pressure from investors to change its structure. In order for OpenAI to secure a $40 billion (roughly Rs. 3,44,386 crore) fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

(AFP via Getty Images, left, and AP file images) By Douglas Schoen PUBLISHED: April 14, 2025 at 3:17 AM EDT The very public \u2013 and often sophomoric\u2013 fights emerging within President Trump\u2019s inner circle have exposed the many different factions desperately competing for Trump\u2019s ear. The two spats \u2013 one between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro and the other between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2013 burst into the public\u2019s view this week as chaos over Trump\u2019s trade policy unnerved markets and business leaders. Ultimately, these fights have immense consequences for the future of Trump\u2019s term. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attempted to brush the issue aside, saying, \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d but the emerging fissures go deeper than mere disagreements over tariff policies. They are symbolic of a proxy war between the longtime MAGA loyalists and the more recent, often more practical \u2013 or less extreme \u2013 supporters. The former are represented by committed ideologues like Navarro, Lutnick and Steve Bannon, who have long pushed Trump to adopt more hardline policies. At the same time, the latter, represented by Musk and other tech and finance titans like Bill Ackman are less idealistic, having backed Trump hoping he would usher in economic prosperity and take a more centrist, common-sense approach to social and cultural issues. Of the two conflicts, the one between Musk and Navarro has been the most public, largely taking place on Musk\u2019s X platform. After Musk took to X to push back against heavy-handed tariffs, Navarro went on CNBC and derided Musk\u2019s Tesla as a simple \u201ccar assembler\u201d rather than an actual \u201ccar manufacturer.\u201d Navarro then insinuated that Tesla\u2019s manufacturing process undermines Trump\u2019s preference for American-made cars, clearly striking a nerve with the world\u2019s richest man and most visible Trump supporter. Musk responded by saying Navarro is \u201ctruly a moron,\u201d accused him of spreading false information, referred to Navarro as \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Plainly, opinions of Musk aside, his position on trade and tariffs is the correct one. Where he believes in truly free trade and understands the benefits of increased global trade, Navarro has been the administration\u2019s loudest champion of protectionist tariffs that would strangle American businesses, bring global trade to a halt, and likely cause a recession. Put another way, Trump would be wise to pay greater attention to the segment of Trump\u2019s coalition that Musk represents \u2013 practical, libertarian, and committed to American dominance of the future industries that will shape the global economy \u2013 than the more extreme, isolationist wing led by Navarro. The other fight within the administration, between Bessent and Lutnick, has not been nearly as public, but it may be even more important for the American economy. Indeed, Bessent has reportedly been advising Trump that tariffs must be a negotiating tactic, rather than a permanent policy, including flying to Florida to push the president to soften his tone. According to Politico , Bessent \u201ctold Trump that markets would remain in peril unless he started putting more emphasis\u201d on the endgame of tariffs \u2013 new trade deals \u2013 and stopped talk of the \u201cpain\u201d Americans would have to endure in a protracted trade war. Bessent\u2019s approach is in direct conflict with Lutnick, who has made regular media appearances stressing that high tariffs are permanent, including telling CNN , Trump is \u201cnot going to back off on tariffs.\u201d Lutnick\u2019s tenure has been marked by these sorts of gaffes. During a CNBC interview on Wednesday, he credited Trump\u2019s policies for the historic surge in the stock market, seemingly oblivious that it was entirely due to Trump doing the very thing Lutnick pledged he wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 backing off on tariffs. On the trade issue, it appears that the Bessent-Musk wing won out, for now at least. The 90-day pause Trump announced on Wednesday may not be a guarantee of no future trade war, but it does give time to negotiate the kind of deals Bessent has advocated for, while suspending the suffocating tariffs pushed by Navarro. Undoubtedly, that policy is the correct one. Had the initial tariffs remained in force for months, the U.S. almost inevitably would have entered a recession. To be sure, these divisions are not new. They have been simmering since even before the inauguration. Last December, the cracks in Trump\u2019s coalition first emerged over the issue of H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. Musk was again leading one side, arguing that these workers allowed American tech companies to maintain their global advantage. The other side, led by Bannon and Laura Loomer, fiercely pushed back, claiming that these migrants \u2013 mostly from India \u2013 were taking jobs away from Americans. Trump eventually came down on Musk\u2019s side, ending that fight, but not the overarching issue of courting a coalition with wildly different \u2013 and often contradictory \u2013 views. For example, Loomer is now apparently back in Trump\u2019s good graces, reportedly being behind the firing of multiple national security officials for supposed \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to the president. Nobody should be under any illusion that the infighting will stop anytime soon. It is a feature of Trump administrations, not an anomaly. Perhaps more than any other president, Trump thrives on playing off his advisor\u2019s diverging views. However, it is clear that if Trump wants to have a successful second term, help Republicans maintain both chambers of Congress, and safeguard his own political legacy, he should lean on the more reserved, professional, and less ideological wing of his coalition. Allowing the extreme, MAGA-loyalists to drive the administration\u2019s policies not only risks wrecking the American economy, but on a wider scale, it risks undermining the Republican Party for years to come.

Supplied The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in use in Cambodia is expected to rise significantly by the end of this year, with a BYD assembly plant scheduled to begin turning out new vehicles in late 2025. During an April 10 meeting between the leadership of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) and a delegation from BYD Auto Industry Co., Ltd., Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the CDC, expressed his appreciation to BYD\u2019s leadership for choosing Cambodia as the location for another assembly plant in the Southeast Asian region. The BYD delegation was led by Xiao Haiping, executive director of the BYD Group President\u2019s Office, who confirmed that the plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of next year. Chanthol explained that, as the Royal Government\u2019s one-stop service body, the CDC is always ready to facilitate and coordinate all private sector investment activities in Cambodia to ensure a favourable, flexible and beneficial investment climate. He also noted that the trend of using BYD cars in Cambodia is on the rise. \u201cOnce the electric vehicle assembly plant is completed and officially begins operations in the fourth quarter of 2025, the usage rate of BYD vehicles in Cambodia is expected to increase even further,\u201d he added. According to BYD executives, a groundbreaking ceremony for the assembly plant is scheduled for the end of April. The BYD assembly plant will be located in the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, which offers convenient transportation access for various components. The plant will involve an investment of over $30 million and is expected to have a production capacity of 10,000 vehicles per year. Recently, BYD also introduced new vehicle models into the Cambodian market, such as the BYD SEALION 5 and BYD ATTO 2, which it described as \u201cnot only high quality and equipped with advanced technology, but also highly fuel-efficient and affordably priced for the Cambodian market\u201d. In June 2024, Prime Minister Hun Manet declared BYD\u2019s establishment of an assembly plant in Cambodia as a major success for the Royal Government\u2019s efforts to attract international investors to the Kingdom. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport recently reported that the number of registered EVs in Cambodia has increased significantly. In 2024, a total of 2,253 EVs were registered \u2014 a 620% increase over 2023, when only 313 new EVs were registered. The report showed that the most popular EV brands in Cambodia are BYD, Toyota and Tesla. Currently, there are six car assembly plants operating in Cambodia, including those for Ford, SsangYong, Hyundai, Kia, GTV and Toyota. latest news Economist: No need for concern over Cambodia\u2019s 90% Chinese trade deficit Drug awareness campaign stepped up during New Year festivities BYD assembly plant to begin Cambodian operations by end of year Fire destroys two motorboats in Kampot province Marigolds bloom for New Year at Tbong Khmum provincial festival Wing Bank Eliminates Cash-Out Fees, Forgoes Millions to Advance Financial Inclusion Rubber exports down as domestic demand increases Gasoline, diesel prices drop by 150 riel Cambodia\u2019s international Q1 trade surged 15% year-on-year Record-setting bridge opens to public for KNY Must Watch More Videos \u276f Shots fired!

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Balmer meticulously planned the assault, using Molotov cocktails and a hammer, intending harm. The attack caused severe damage to the historic residence, symbolizing the erosion of democratic norms. Bipartisan backlash condemned the violence, though media double standards on political violence persist. The incident highlights a broader crisis where extremism replaces democratic discourse with brute force. In the predawn hours of April 13, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, his wife Lori, their four children, and guests were jolted awake by state troopers banging on their door. An arsonist had just firebombed their Harrisburg residence, hurling homemade explosives through shattered windows in what authorities called a \"targeted\" act of terrorism. The suspect, Cody Balmer, 38\u2014who later admitted to \"harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro\u2014turned himself in after confessing he would have assaulted the governor with a hammer if confronted. This brazen attack underscores a chilling trend: the erosion of democratic norms as political violence becomes alarmingly routine in America. A premeditated assault on democracy Balmer\u2019s meticulously planned attack reads like a domestic terrorism manual. According to Pennsylvania State Police affidavits, he siphoned gasoline from a lawnmower, filled Heineken bottles to create Molotov cocktails, and walked an hour to the governor\u2019s mansion. Surveillance footage captured him scaling a perimeter fence, smashing windows with a hammer, and igniting fires in the piano and dining rooms\u2014spaces where Shapiro\u2019s family had hosted a Passover Seder hours earlier. \"He was very methodical in his approach,\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens. Balmer\u2019s admission that he anticipated harming occupants reveals intent beyond property damage; this was an attempted political assassination. The damage was severe : ceilings collapsed, furniture was reduced to ash, and Passover decorations lay blackened beside shattered glass. Yet the greater devastation is symbolic. The governor\u2019s residence\u2014a historic building housing state art and eight gubernatorial families since 1968\u2014was violated not by a random criminal, but by a man weaponizing ideological rage. The backlash was swift and cross-partisan. Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman called the attack \"unacceptable,\" emphasizing, \"There is no place for violence in our society.\" Shapiro, a Democrat, echoed this: \"I don\u2019t give a damn if it\u2019s coming from one particular side or the other \u2026 It has to stop.\" Such solidarity is critical, yet it raises uncomfortable questions. Would national media devote equal coverage if a Republican governor were targeted? Recent history suggests not. When a left-wing activist shot GOP Congressman Steve Scalise in 2017 or when Trump supporters faced violent riots in 2020, many outlets downplayed the ideological motives. This double standard fuels division. As Shapiro noted, violent rhetoric\u2014whether from fringe online forums or mainstream commentators\u2014creates a permission structure for extremists. Balmer\u2019s actions didn\u2019t emerge in a vacuum. They reflect a culture where dehumanizing political opponents has become routine. The broader crisis: Violence as political language The Shapiro attack joins a grim roster: with the 2017 shooting of Rep. Scalise joined by last year\u2019s assassination attempts against Donald Trump and the ongoing burning and firebombing of Tesla vehicles. The common thread? A rejection of democratic resolution in favor of brute force. Balmer\u2019s use of improvised explosives mirrors tactics seen in extremist playbooks, yet his profile\u2014a Harrisburg local with prior theft charges\u2014defies easy categorization. This unpredictability makes such threats harder to combat. Critically, Balmer\u2019s hatred wasn\u2019t abstract. He told police he knew Shapiro might be home, accepting the risk of casualties. This distinguishes the act from mere vandalism; it was terrorism designed to intimidate a sitting official and his constituents. Authorities charged Balmer with eight felonies, including terrorism and attempted murder. Yet legal consequences alone won\u2019t remedy the societal sickness enabling such violence. Shapiro\u2019s refusal to be \"deterred\" is commendable, but his call for unity must be matched by systemic action: bolstering security for officials, de-escalating incendiary rhetoric, and rejecting partisan hypocrisy in condemning attacks. The fire at the governor\u2019s mansion is a flare illuminating America\u2019s crisis of civility. When ideology justifies arson against elected leaders, democracy itself burns. As Shapiro said amidst the ashes: \"We have to be better than this.\" Sources for this article include: 100PercentFedUp.com Fox43.com CNN.com FoxNews.com Related Topics antifa arson bias chaos Dangerous domestic terrorism insanity Josh Shapiro left cult political violence rioting Latest News 04/14/2025 / By Willow Tohi DOJ launches Second Amendment Task Force amid federal rollback of gun control measures 04/14/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Housing market panic escalates: A perfect storm of tariff fears, inflation, high interest rates, and historic unaffordability 04/14/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Father speaks out: Challenging the mainstream narrative of his daughter\u2019s \u201cunvaccinated measles death\u201d 04/14/2025 / By Willow Tohi Convenience culture\u2019s hidden toll: Study links ultra-processed foods to reduced lifespan and environmental harm 04/14/2025 / By Laura Harris Trump administration proposes $998 daily fines on migrants defying deportation orders 04/14/2025 / By Ava Grace RFK Jr. launches federal probe into autism surge, vows answers by 2025 Related News 03/24/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Bernie Sanders, \u201canti-oligarchy rally\u201d exposed as staged spectacle with bussed-in activists tied to antifa, pro-hamas networks 03/24/2025 / By Lance D Johnson Tesla, Elon Musk targeted by same useful idiot domestic terrorists that burned and pillaged American cities in 2020 03/23/2025 / By Willow Tohi EXPOSED: Antifa and IRS collude to shield radical funding from taxation 03/10/2025 / By S.D.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Sam Altman, a dad and OpenAI's CEO, loves one smart crib for his baby son. His top baby gear picks so far are Cradlewise's crib and lots of burp cloths. At $1,999, Cradlewise is pricer than the Snoo \u2014 but it can be used for longer. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, is deep in new-dad life \u2014 and he's already sharing strong opinions on baby gear. \"We bought a lot of silly baby things that we haven't needed,\" he posted on X on Sunday night. \"But definitely I recommend a Cradlewise crib and a lot more burp rags than you think you could possibly need.\" Cradlewise hasn't made as many headlines as its older and bigger competitor, the Snoo \u2014 the sleek, motorized bassinet that's basically the Tesla of baby tech . The Snoo , designed by celebrity pediatrician Harvey Karp, has been the go-to setup for sleep-deprived parents for nearly a decade. It uses motion, white noise, and a built-in swaddle to gently rock babies back to sleep. Retailing at $1,695, or $159 a month to rent, the Snoo has amassed a devoted fan base, including celebrity parents like Justin Timberlake and Zoe Salda\u00f1a , who invested in the company. Altman's pick, Cradlewise, works a little differently \u2014 and at nearly $2,000, it's the pricier option. Instead of waiting for cries, it bounces the baby gently up and down to preempt fussing. It also skips the built-in swaddle, one of Snoo's signature features, and includes a built-in baby monitor and music features. Parents can use Cradlewise's crib for longer with a growing baby. The Snoo tops out at around six months old. Cradlewise converts from bassinet to crib, so it can be used until the baby turns two years old or meets other milestones, like weight. \"We're so grateful to Sam Altman for choosing Cradlewise for their baby,\" Radhika Patil, the CEO and cofounder of Cradlewise, told Business Insider. \"It means a lot coming from someone who truly understands the power of good tech.\" Snoo did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. 'Having a kid changed a lot of things' Altman and his husband, software engineer Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their baby boy in February . The newborn came early and spent some time in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Get CounterPunch in your inbox. Home $0.00 April 14, 2025 Surrender in Slow Motion: The Soft Collapse of American Democracy Nick Allison Getty and Unsplash+. It still feels a little paranoid to say it out loud: that the United States might be drifting toward something that looks a lot like Russia. Or Hungary. Or some unholy blend of theocratic nostalgia and corporate feudalism. But that gut feeling\u2014the one that says something\u2019s not right\u2014is getting harder to shake. The signs aren\u2019t exactly subtle, either. To anyone paying attention, they\u2019re plenty loud. But they\u2019re also easy to tune out, easy to dismiss as noise, as politics as usual. What\u2019s harder to ignore are the rituals. The reverence. The worship. The way power starts to look like something owed. We don\u2019t usually start naming highways after sitting presidents\u2014especially ones under multiple indictments, most especially ones wildly obsessed with power and openly musing about a third term. But here we are. A bill in Texas proposes to rename a stretch of I-35 the \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump Highway.\u201d It may not even pass, but that almost doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s one of a growing list of gestures aimed at deifying a man who, by any rational standard, should be facing serious consequences for his role in the January 6th insurrection\u2014an attack on the peaceful transfer of power that many legal scholars argue should disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment , if not result in criminal charges for inciting sedition. Instead, we get a slow-motion canonization. Lawmakers have floated putting Trump\u2019s face on currency, making his birthday a federal holiday, and renaming airports in his honor . Some supporters even want to carve his likeness into Mount Rushmore. Religious leaders compare him to biblical kings \u2014chosen vessels, sent by God. This isn\u2019t politics anymore. It\u2019s mythology. It\u2019s the construction of a parallel reality where Trump isn\u2019t just a man, but a savior figure. The kind of figure who can do no wrong, whose followers speak of him in reverent tones, who must be protected at all costs. This is how democratic values rot\u2014not all at once, but through the slow normalization of idolatry disguised as patriotism. But mythology only works if it can crowd out reality. Repression needs scaffolding\u2014and no tool is more effective than confusion. The Trump administration doesn\u2019t just clash with the press; it undermines the very concept of truth. \u201cFake news\u201d isn\u2019t a throwaway insult anymore\u2014it\u2019s a strategy. A sustained campaign to flood the information space and make facts feel optional. Reporters who challenge the administration are smeared as traitors or \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives. Trump still calls mainstream journalists \u201c the enemy of the people, \u201d echoing the language of the dictators and strongmen he seems to admire so much. Investigations are dismissed as partisan attacks. Whistleblowers are discredited before they speak. Independent newsrooms face lawsuits, threats, and coordinated disinformation campaigns designed to corrode public trust. And it works. The more chaotic the noise, the easier it is to tune out the signal. Truth becomes something to argue about, not act on. And once reality gets slippery, everything else is easier to break. Books get banned. Curricula get sanitized. Judges face harassment for upholding the law. Ordinary people start second-guessing what they post, what they share, what they say out loud. It doesn\u2019t take long for folks to forget what used to be obvious: opposition to authoritarianism is essential to a free society. *** I live in Austin, Texas, a city that prides itself on being an outlier inside a state that loves to talk about freedom while quietly legislating the opposite. This is a state where \u201csmall government\u201d somehow includes sweeping preemption laws, micromanaging what books kids can read, and controlling uteruses. The message is clear: freedom is fine\u2014as long as it\u2019s defined by those in power. Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country \u2014providers can face life in prison, and even individuals assisting in abortion access risk legal consequences, even in cases of rape or incest. In public schools, Bible-based curricula are slipping into classrooms under the name of \u201cvalues\u201d or \u201cpatriotism,\u201d incentivized by lawmakers. It\u2019s not freedom\u2014it\u2019s state-mandated morality dressed up as tradition. There\u2019s a reflex in this country\u2014maybe in every country\u2014to label dissent as disloyalty. Criticize the government, and suddenly you\u2019re \u201canti-American.\u201d I don\u2019t buy that. I love this country and the ideals it\u2019s supposed to stand for. When I enlisted in the Army and volunteered for the infantry, I swore an oath. I\u2019ve seen firsthand what it means to put your body on the line for a set of principles. Sure, my war was Iraq. And in hindsight, it\u2019s clear we weren\u2019t exactly defending American freedoms by invading a nation that had nothing to do with 9/11. But the men I served with\u2014some of whom never came home\u2014weren\u2019t there for oil or politics. They were there because they believed in service. Many had volunteered in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, willing to risk their lives to protect something bigger than themselves. They believed in the promise of liberty, accountability, and a system worth defending. And some of them probably support President Trump. I don\u2019t speak for them\u2014and while I respect their right to that choice, I won\u2019t pretend to understand it. But I do know what we all swore to uphold. Our oath wasn\u2019t to a man, or a party, or even a flag. It was to a Constitution\u2014one that\u2019s supposed to hold this nation together. (1) That\u2019s why this matters to me. When I see politicians twisting those principles into tools of repression, I don\u2019t call it patriotism. I call it what it is: a threat. And while there are many faces to that threat, perhaps none illustrates it more clearly right now than Elon Musk\u2014a man elected by no one, yet handed more control over federal institutions than most cabinet secretaries. His financial influence didn\u2019t just buy him a seat at the table. It bought him the table. *** Elon Musk\u2014billionaire, attention addict, CEO of everything\u2014holds real political power now. Not metaphorically, not just influence-by-Twitter (or X, or whatever that ad-choked echo chamber is calling itself today). Trump brought him in early to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency\u2014DOGE, which sounds like a joke until you realize it\u2019s not. As a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d Musk was handed sweeping authority to cancel contracts, slash programs, and restructure entire federal agencies. No election. No confirmation. No accountability\u2014except to Trump and his inner circle. Musk has used that power like a wrecking ball. USAID, gutted. The CFPB, gutted. The VA, slashed. Now the Department of Education is on the chopping block\u2014literally. Trump already signed the executive order to begin dismantling it, with the justification that schools should be governed \u201clocally.\u201d But the fallout is anything but local. Teachers\u2019 unions, the NAACP, and civil rights organizations are suing , warning that the move violates the Constitution and threatens to gut federal protections for vulnerable students. Meanwhile, DOGE\u2019s attempts to access sensitive agency data have been blocked by federal courts, citing privacy concerns and executive overreach. And like clockwork, Musk\u2019s signature chaos-management style has followed him into government: mass firings with little discernment, followed by quiet attempts to rehire the very people dismissed \u2014nuclear safety experts, pandemic response staff, oversight personnel\u2014when it turns out gutting institutions has consequences. Even Musk\u2019s own support is starting to wobble. His approval numbers have slipped. Protests have spread. Tesla cars have been vandalized, and a whole side hustle economy has popped up to cash in \u2014selling bumper stickers to owners who bought the car before they realized what kind of guy came with it. Movements like \u201c Tesla Takedown ,\u201d built around public shaming and targeted boycotts of Musk\u2019s brands, are picking up steam. Trump\u2019s base still defends him, mostly\u2014but they\u2019re beginning to sour on Musk. The golden boy of techno-libertarianism now looks a lot more like a self-dealing billionaire with too much control over their lives. Musk\u2019s role in the administration isn\u2019t just a weird twist of the Trump saga. It\u2019s a symptom of something much deeper: the corrosion of democratic norms in real time. When unelected billionaires are empowered to disassemble the federal government and profit from the fallout , we\u2019re not looking at innovation. We\u2019re looking at privatized power in patriotic packaging. Legal scholars are already sounding the alarm about a coming constitutional crisis. The rule of law is being selectively applied, courts are being ignored or sidelined, and the balance of power is being bent toward executive fiat. If the Constitution is a framework built on checks and balances, then we\u2019re watching those supports be quietly removed, one by one. This isn\u2019t hypothetical. It\u2019s happening. And if it continues unchecked, we\u2019re not just flirting with autocracy \u2014we\u2019re laying out a red carpet for it. And it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum. The courts have been methodically reengineered. Three Supreme Court justices were installed during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014after he lost the popular vote\u2014with help from a Senate that represents a minority of Americans. Lower courts have been stacked with ideologues who don\u2019t hide their contempt for civil rights. And then there are the laws\u2014quietly passed, easily overlooked\u2014that encourage citizens to snitch , sue, or surveil each other under the guise of morality or tradition. It\u2019s not just policy anymore; it\u2019s a culture shift. A moral panic turned into legislation. *** None of this is new. We\u2019ve seen this playbook before. Germany in the 1930s didn\u2019t collapse overnight. It slid\u2014through legal channels, institutional decay, and the slow boiling of norms. Russia didn\u2019t need a coup; it had bureaucracy, media control, and just enough plausible deniability. Hungary rewrote its constitution and wrapped its authoritarianism in flags and hymns. The slogans vary\u2014family, faith, purity, tradition\u2014but the structure is the same: consolidate power, erode checks, rebrand repression as righteousness. Here, it\u2019s not boots in the street\u2014it\u2019s bans in the library. It\u2019s teachers rewriting syllabi out of fear. It\u2019s protesters labeled extremists, and voting rights treated like optional extras. The message isn\u2019t \u201cyou can\u2019t speak.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s the whisper before the silence. I\u2019m not a paranoid person. I have no patience for conspiracy freaks or tinfoil logic. I try to root my thinking in science and history\u2014in what can be known, what can be verified. But even so, I\u2019m not immune to the quiet worries that slip through the cracks. I\u2019m writing this on a device connected to the internet. Nothing is truly private. Nothing online ever really disappears. That\u2019s not a problem with this essay\u2014I plan to publish it. But what about private messages? Notes? Conversations with AI? Whether we like it or not, tools like ChatGPT are becoming fixtures in daily life. People use them to draft emails, unpack personal dilemmas, or ask the kinds of questions they\u2019re not ready to say out loud. But these aren\u2019t confidants. They\u2019re algorithms trained to guess the next likely word. No mind, no morals, no memory. Are they logging dissent? Mapping behavior? Storing keywords for some future review? Maybe not. Or maybe not yet. But let\u2019s not underestimate the creativity of bad actors with power. The infrastructure exists. And if the political winds shift hard enough, all it takes is a flip of a switch. When it comes to tech abuse, the current administration\u2019s incompetence might actually be our last line of defense. These are, after all, the same people who planned a military strike in a Signal group chat\u2014and accidentally invited a journalist. If Orwell wrote fiction, these guys are writing farce. Jokes aside, the surveillance state doesn\u2019t need to be competent\u2014just connected. Metadata is already vacuumed up. GPS logs, browsing habits, biometric patterns\u2014all cross-referenced with identities. If this all sounds like dystopian fiction, that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve been trained to think of it that way. But it\u2019s not fiction. The systems are real. The only thing missing is the right justification: National security. Public order. \u201cFamily values.\u201d \u201cProtecting the children.\u201d And then comes the refrain: If you\u2019ve got nothing to hide, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear. That\u2019s how it always starts. *** The threat isn\u2019t abstract anymore. It\u2019s not looming\u2014it\u2019s embedded. Not with jackboots and batons\u2014though keep going down this road and we\u2019ll get there\u2014but with procedural language and patriotic branding. It waits for fatigue to set in. For outrage to give way to apathy. For protest to feel futile, and speaking up to feel like a risk. We\u2019ve been conditioned to treat comparisons to fascism as melodramatic. Alarmist. But sometimes, alarmist just means paying attention. When journalists are attacked, when courts are captured, when books are pulled from shelves and history is rewritten in real time, it\u2019s not alarmist to say the house is on fire. It\u2019s responsible. Authoritarianism doesn\u2019t need everyone to go silent\u2014just enough people afraid of making noise. It thrives on hesitation. On people weighing the cost of resistance against the ease of going along. That\u2019s the most dangerous part\u2014not the censorship itself, but the internalized version. The self-editing. The second-guessing. The voice that says: Maybe just let it go. Maybe don\u2019t post that. Maybe don\u2019t write this. But I\u2019d rather name it now than whisper about it later. If this country is still salvageable\u2014and I believe it is\u2014it won\u2019t be because we waited politely. It\u2019ll be because enough people chose not to. Because silence isn\u2019t safety. It\u2019s surrender in slow motion. *** To Those Who Still Support President Trump Maybe you still support Donald Trump and his approach to governing. A lot of people clearly do. Or maybe you just choose to look the other way. Either way, ask yourself this: what happens when the next president isn\u2019t your guy? When someone you don\u2019t trust\u2014someone you don\u2019t like and didn\u2019t vote for\u2014inherits the same unchecked authority, the same gutted institutions, the same executive branch reshaped for loyalty over law? To be fair, this didn\u2019t start with Trump. The power of the presidency has been sliding in this direction for decades. But he sure as hell didn\u2019t slow it down\u2014he stepped on the gas. And that\u2019s the thing about power: once it expands, it rarely contracts. The people who come next don\u2019t give it back\u2014they just find new ways to use it\u2026 to abuse it. The Founders weren\u2019t perfect, but they knew what concentrated power could do. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t build a throne\u2014they built limits. Guardrails. And we\u2019re watching those get stripped for parts. You might like who\u2019s driving now. But what happens when you don\u2019t?

That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.

Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Blame the magnificent seven \u2013 especially Nvidia . You can\u2019t exactly blame mega-cap stocks because Donald Trump felt like stirring the market pot, but tech stock oscillations \u2013 on Wednesday, following dizzying declines, Tesla , Nvidia and Apple soared 22.7, 18.7 and 15.3 per cent, respectively \u2013 are having an outsized impact on indices. Much attention has focused on the mag seven\u2019s growing influence on index returns, given they account for 30 per cent of the S&P 500\u2032s market capitalisation and 17 per cent of the MSCI All-Cap World Index\u2019s (ACWI).

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft. So if your portfolio\u2019s giving you indigestion, check the label \u2013 it probably says Nvidia.

However, it\u2019d be even better if Elon focused more on striking closer to the root of the problem: the public\u2019s economic ignorance from which all the disastrous, coercive, competition-immune, monopolistic government central planning, spending, and also warmongering grows. This is precisely what Ludwig von Mises did, and I like to call it the \u201cMisesian formula\u201d for prosperity. Mises devoted parts of his majestic treatise Human Action (1949) to the formula. In a section aptly titled \u201cEconomics and the Citizen,\u201d Mises writes : 5-Minute Core Exercise... Dzenitis, Tami Brehse Best Price: $3.81 Buy New $8.68 (as of 03:36 UTC - Details ) Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man\u2019s human existence\u2026. All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of\u2026economics. Everybody\u2019s mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines\u2026. Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories\u2026. As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake\u2026. \u2026all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society\u2019s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen. Since it\u2019s real freedom and capitalism that lead to prosperity, explaining this to people is, per Mises, \u201c the primary civic duty .\u201d Riding the wave of economic education, Javier Milei had been spearheading on his way to electoral triumph in Argentina, on November 8, 2023 Elon tweeted a Hayek meme writing: \u201cBest economist ever.\u201d A week later, on December 4, he tweeted , \u201cGreat book by Hayek\u201d while linking to Hayek\u2019s classic book The Road To Serfdom , and another meme quoting Hayek : \u201cnothing could contribute more to the cure of humanity\u2019s ills than to give people a better understanding of economics .\u201d Elon is thus increasingly aware of the need to educate, but still far from having a Misesian ethos-understanding. Mankind\u2019s problems are overwhelmingly the result of the public\u2019s economic ignorance which then, via democracy, manifests itself in the order-destroying bureaucracies. It is their ignorance\u2014that of your neighbor, family members, and likely former self\u2014that is near the root of the problem, not whatever homo sapiens people vote for. The very root of this economic ignorance, as significantly shown by founder of the \u201cAustrian School of Economics,\u201d Carl Menger, is the fact that money (and its vital emerging benefits like profit-loss calculation), trade, the division of labor, economic competition, etc. are\u2014to borrow Adam Ferguson\u2019s popular phrase \u2014\u201cindeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.\u201d Hardly anyone, and much less people of significant influence, likely including Elon, are aware of this. One of my favorite little-known Libertarian books is Walter Block\u2019s I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians , which contains over 80 autobiographical essays-interviews of leading libertarians/free marketeers like Walter himself, Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, Peter Boettke, etc., describing how they became libertarians/free marketeers. It is easy to see how many of them went from being ignorant big government, socialist myth-believers to champions of freedom and emerging civilization, by stumbling upon sound economics. Mises (1881-1973) died long before the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) and pro-capitalist reforms in China, thus he spent his lifetime fighting a losing intellectual battle, as socialist myths expanded their control of more countries. He writes : From time to time I entertained the hope that my writings would bear practical fruit and point policy in the right direction. I have always looked for evidence of a change in ideology. But I never actually deceived myself; my theories explain, but cannot slow the decline of a great civilization. I set out to be a reformer, but only became the historian of decline. After WWI, he carried the same determination in his Atlas-like intellectual-educational efforts: How one carries on in the face of unavoidable catastrophe is a matter of temperament\u2026. Again and again I had met with situations from which rational deliberation found no means of escape; but then the unexpected intervened, and with it came salvation. I would not lose courage even now. I wanted to do everything an economist could do. I would not tire in saying what I knew to be true. Mises again , in Human Action : \u2026in the field of social organization and economic policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doctrines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such thing as an unpopular system of government\u2026. The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowledge. It determines the whole process of human history\u2026. \u2026great men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans if they do not convince public opinion. The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority. Mises\u2019s wisdom above predicts what is happening to Elon and his DOGE, and again highlights the need to \u201cconvince public opinion.\u201d Although Elon has gained support from many, a large percentage of the economically-ignorant public is increasingly, fanatically against Elon\u2019s efforts. Bolshevik-like, intellectually dangerous ideologues like Robert Reich have been constantly spewing anti-economics and violence-inducing class-warfare rhetoric. For example, on March 12, 2025, Reich wrote in Facebook: Elon Musk is trying to steal the federal government \u2014 slashing public services, firing civil servants, and handing power to billionaires like himself. I salute the brave public servants who are resisting this coup. This type of mindset by the economically ignorant masses have made Musk one of the most hated men in America, to be destroyed via lawfare and even physical violence. From January 29 to March 10, 2025, there have been 9 attacks on Tesla locations . On March 10, X/Twitter suffered a relatively massive outage which, at the time, Elon felt originated in Ukraine, showing the potential dangers of being against the interests of millions vested in neocon warfare. I would not be surprised if SpaceX and Tesla are already\u2014or will eventually be\u2014victims of internal sabotage. Statistically, as the anti-Elon dice keep getting rolled at an increasing rate, he will likely be brought down somehow. Besides, as Vincent Cook\u2019s article \u201c Is DOGE a Dog When It Comes to Real Federal Spending? \u201d shows, there are too many legal obligations for DOGE to make significant cuts. Elon is attacking the symptoms of economic ignorance, not the root causes like Mises did. With a more Misesian intellectual background and educational strategy, Javier Milei\u2014similar to Ron Paul\u2014managed to educate enough people to win the presidency of Argentina. In an interview with Ben Shapiro, Milei explained how the intellectual revolution grew from economic education: The Next Civil War: Di... Marche, Stephen Best Price: $10.12 Buy New $13.64 (as of 10:51 UTC - Details ) This time young people were really educated. We would organize what we called the concerts. They were political rallies\u2026 At these rallies we had stands\u2026with books. Minister Bullrich\u2026said something brilliant, \u201cyou should pay more attention to what Milei is doing. It\u2019s not normal for a politician to be talking to 20 or 30 thousand people about Hayek.\u201d Young people started to evangelize at home with their parents and grandparents. Mises wrote : Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority\u2026 It has full confidence in man\u2019s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future. In other words, we must believe that we can educate \u201cthe immense majority,\u201d and thus act accordingly, even if it proves to be futile, otherwise \u201cthere is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future.\u201d Mises concludes Human Action : The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the human race.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More A year before global markets were upended by President Trump's tariffs, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned shareholders of the rising threat of China's electric vehicle makers. In Tesla's Q4 earnings call on January 24, 2024, Mr Musk said: The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They are extremely good. I'm aware this story could go in many directions from here. But I'll focus on China's biggest EV maker, its rising dominance, and the implications for ASX lithium shares . Last week, I wrote a story that looked at whether or not the plunging lithium price had finally hit the bottom . A key factor that will determine where the price of lithium will go from here is demand, particularly Chinese demand. The latest Resources and Energy Quarterly report states that global lithium demand is forecast to grow by almost 13% a year to 2030. A closer look reveals forecasts of increased demand for lithium are largely based on expectations of increased uptake of electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. And BYD , which has now overtaken Tesla to become the biggest supplier of EVs in the world, will play a significant part in fuelling that demand. In 2024, more than 90% of Australia's lithium exports were shipped to China, and the Middle Kingdom's appetite for lithium shows no sign of slowing down. Chinese demand for lithium is set to rise as the biggest player in the EV space continues to expand despite tariff implications. In 2024, BYD reported that it had delivered 4.24 million vehicles, up from around 3 million the previous year. Charging ahead BYD is now selling almost as many vehicles as Ford, an astonishing feat for a company that has been around for only 30 years. This year, the company is projecting that it will deliver about 5.5 million EVs. It's likely that President Trump's tariffs will do little to slow BYD's rising dominance in the electric vehicle market. BYD's biggest market is China, where rising adoption rates of electric vehicles contributed to global EV sales growth of 26% last year. Other key markets for BYD include Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. And momentum is continuing into 2025 and beyond. Analysts at JPMorgan have raised their estimate for BYD's vehicle deliveries for 2026 to 6.5 million units. As BYD continues its astronomical growth path, it will have a material impact on global lithium demand. I'm not suggesting that all this means that the price of lithium has hit the floor. But it does seem clear that the signs do point to a more optimistic outlook for ASX-listed lithium players, including Pilbara Minerals Ltd ( ASX: PLS ), Minerals Resources Ltd ( ASX: MIN ), and Liontown Resources Ltd ( ASX: LTR ).

The Chinese government is drafting a new regulatory system for exports, and while the policies are being framed, the shipments of the magnets, essential for the manufacturing of almost everything ranging from cars to missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports, according to a report by The New York Times. Per the report, once the new regulatory system is in place, it could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors. US Dependency On Chinese Imports The official crackdown on exports is part of Beijing's retaliation against US President Trump's punishing trade war. China produces around 90 per cent of the world's rare earths, a group of 17 elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and electronics industries. Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related items, have been placed on the export control list. The United States has only one rare earths mine, and most of its supply comes from China. Beijing placed export restrictions on rare earth elements on April 2 as part of a broader package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump's decision to hike tariffs against most Chinese products to 54 per cent. The export curbs include not only mined minerals but permanent magnets and other finished products that will be difficult to replace, analysts said. The move, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further ratchets up trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and leaves American manufacturers scrambling for fresh supplies of the critical minerals they have relied upon for decades. Now, metals and special magnets made with them can only be shipped out of China with special export licenses, the NYT report said. However, Beijing's system to issue these licenses is barely in place, which is causing consternation among industry executives that the process could drag on and that current supplies of minerals and products outside of China could run low. A Move To Exert Dominance The move, which affects exports to all countries, not just the US, is the latest demonstration of China's ability to weaponize its dominance over the mining and processing of the critical minerals. While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, Beijing can throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it issues. Lockheed Martin, Tesla and Apple are among the US companies that use Chinese rare earths in their supply chains. The US government has stockpiles of some rare earths, but not enough to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity. Beijing has already imposed outright bans on the export of three metals to the US and slapped export controls on many others. The moves to restrict heavy rare earths are especially important because China has even tighter control over these elements, David Merriman at consultancy Project Blue, told Reuters. \"There is currently only one HREE (heavy rare earth element) focused operation outside of China, Myanmar and Laos,\" he said, adding that China has close involvement in supply chains from Myanmar and Laos. Why Rare Metals Are Important For The US The heavy rare earth metals put under export suspension by China are used in magnets-- essential for many kinds of electric motors used in the manufacturing of electric cars, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft and gasoline-powered cars. These metals are required for the manufacturing of jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs and capacitors, which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones.

In this highly volatile situation, a Tesla patent from 2023 could be the answer to the conundrum of de-risking America's supply chains, at least where rare earth metals are concerned.

In contrast to the commonly held view, the US can't just start refining its own copious rare earth resources at the flip of a switch, for such a feat requires an intricate interplay of massive funding, energy, infrastructure, and vertically integrated supply chain partners. While the US can certainly establish its own rare earth domain, it would likely require the better part of a decade. Slitted Magnet for Selective Coercivity: Tesla's Novel Approach to Rare Earth Metal Reduction @Tesla 's WO2024097176A1 patent introduces an innovative magnet manufacturing technique that transforms electric vehicle motor production through strategic cavity-based doping. By\u2026 pic.twitter.com/tZcaJ03OPG \u2014 SETI Park (@seti_park) December 4, 2024 So, what's the solution in the interim? Well, one idea centers around significantly reducing the use of rare earth metals in key industrial processes, and Tesla might offer one such avenue worth pursuing. To wit, in a patent filed back in 2023, bearing the international publication number WO2024097176A1 , Tesla describes a 'keyhole surgery-like process' to significantly reduce the need for rare earth metals in the manufacturing process of electric motors. The process involves the creation of \"controlled-depth cavities (0.2-1.5mm wide) in magnet structure,\" which then allow for the introduction of specific dopants. According to the patent, the process achieves desired magnetic properties while significantly reducing rare earth metal usage and manufacturing complexity. Of course, it remains unclear if Tesla is using this approach in its gigafactories, and to what extent. However, the approach does stand out for its simplicity and, therefore, could constitute a viable avenue for de-risking America's intertwined supply chains.

But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. AP Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump 's first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company's Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google's co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley's environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what's happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. Live Events \"One of the things I've seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\" Lyons said.

But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. \"I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\" said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry. \"The shift hasn't been for a lot of people,\" said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \"It's a handful of people who've gotten the attention.\" The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of the world's best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House 's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk . Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. \"We're still in the belly of the beast,\" said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \"If the lake was frozen, there's a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\" The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington's business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world's problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers' dreams of changing the world for the better. Google's motto was \"don't be evil,\" a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. \"Now,\" she said, \"if you're part of a startup, you're hoping you'll be absorbed in a way that's profitable.\" Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. \"I feel sick to my stomach now,\" she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. \"I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\" Sylvester said. \"It was not all OK.\" It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump's challenges to the country's system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley's top executives. \"The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\" said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \"Unfortunately, you've got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\" \"Just coming here, everyone's saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\" Wood added. \"We're all scared.\" Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. \"The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.\" Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition Asian Paints is trading at P/E lower than pandemic levels.

Cred is in early talks to raise new funds at a reduced valuation. This and more scoops in a packed edition of ETtech Morning Dispatch. Also in the letter: \u25a0 Bumrah\u2019s latest delivery \u25a0 India\u2019s tariff advantage \u25a0 K\u2019taka\u2019s gig welfare policy Scoop: Cred in talks to raise new funds as valuation slips by over 30% to $4 billion Credit card bill payments startup Cred has held discussions to pick up new funds at a lower valuation compared to its previous round, several people in the know said. Deal details: Existing backers, including Singaporean sovereign fund GIC, Peak XV Partners, Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, QED, among others are in discussions to invest $100-$200 million in Cred\u2019s latest financing, people in the know told us. The round could value Cred anywhere between $3.5-4 billion, a significant drop from its $6.4 billion valuation in 2022 . Valuation correction: If the round goes through, the Kunal Shah-led Cred may become one of the first major fintechs to raise venture funding at a markdown from its 2022 peak. Despite steady revenue growth and positive cash flow, sources said Cred\u2019s decision to pursue a down round reflects broader market realities. Between 2021 and 2022, the startup\u2019s valuation jumped from $3.4 billion to $6.4 billion in a year\u2019s time. Global fintech reset: Silicon Valley-based payments giant Stripe slashed its valuation from a 2021 peak of $95 billion to $50 billion last year . Earlier this year, Stripe disclosed that investors purchased employee shares through a tender offer at a $91.5 billion valuation. Swedish fintech firm Klarna saw its valuation plunge from $46 billion to $6.7 billion. Having delayed its IPO, Klarna now aims for a valuation above $15 billion when it eventually lists . Pushing growth: The fresh capital would help Cred accelerate growth across its business lines spanning lending, insurance, ecommerce and digital payments. Part of the funding may also bolster its lending arm, Newtap Finance, which aims to play a larger role in Cred's expanding financial services portfolio.

Funding woes: The company's monthly cash burn exceeds Rs 20 crore, prompting the decision to wind down its core operations. Earlier this year, a $50 million fundraising effort collapsed after existing investors refused to inject fresh capital. Financial troubles have deepened due to a debt crisis at Gensol Engineering, a firm backed by BluSmart founders Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. This has further constrained access to funds for the ride-hailing business. What else: Once BluSmart\u2019s vehicles are listed on Uber, the startup will receive a share of fare revenues while Uber retains its standard commission\u2014just as it does with other fleet operators or individual driver partners. Leadership exodus: Several senior BluSmart executives have recently stepped down, including fleet CEO Anirudh Arun, chief technology officer Rishabh Sood, and chief business officer Tushar Garg, formerly of Uber India.

In recent years, cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, and Hardik Pandya have increasingly invested in businesses or launched their own ventures. Investment details: Sudip Ghose, founder of Uppercase, revealed that the company will collaborate with Bumrah to develop a new line of products, including luggage, backpacks, and gym bags, designed primarily for athletes. Bumrah will receive a share of the profits from these items. Other happenings: Last week, former Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli ended his Rs 110 crore endorsement deal with Puma after eight years.

Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary: Electronics tariff exemptions are temporary, chip tariffs coming soon The goods will soon fall under a new semiconductor-specific tariff policy, likely within two months By AP- PTI Updated - April 14, 2025 at 07:33 AM. | Nashville US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The ongoing ambiguity has rattled markets, especially Big Tech firms like Apple and Nvidia, with experts warning of severe disruption to supply chains and investor confidence. | Photo Credit: NATHAN HOWARD/Reuters Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no \u201cexception\u201d at all because the goods are \u201cjust moving to a different\" bucket and will still face a 20 per cent tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren't usually made in the US The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won't be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. Also read Apple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India to beat Trump tariffs, sources say It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was \u201ctaking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Also read Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. Comments Published on April 14, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS. THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS.

Navarro is \"truly a moron\" and \"dumber than a sack of bricks,\" Musk posted to his X social platform last week during a spat over the American parts content in Tesla vehicles. He later dubbed the Trump advisor \"Peter Retarrdo\" in a separate post. \"I've been called worse. Everything's fine with Elon,\" Navarro told broadcaster NBC on Sunday. \"Elon is doing a very good job with his team with waste, fraud and abuse. That's a tremendous contribution to America,\" he added of Musk's aggressive cost-cutting through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Navarro had taken aim at Tesla after the billionaire Musk, who also owns SpaceX, proposed a free-trade zone between the US and Europe. The economist claimed Tesla mostly assembled components like batteries and motors shipped in from factories in Asia. Those are exactly the types of jobs Trump says his trade offensive is designed to bring back to America. Musk retorted with studies he said showed \"Tesla has the most American-made cars.\" \"Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,\" he added -- referring to a fictional pundit Navarro quoted in a series of books and a policy memo, using an anagram of his own name. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt tried last week to play down the public feud, saying that \"boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue.\" Do you like the content of this article?

Navarro is \"truly a moron\" and \"dumber than a sack of bricks,\" Musk posted to his X social platform last week during a spat over the American parts content in Tesla vehicles. He later dubbed the Trump advisor \"Peter Retarrdo\" in a separate post. \"I've been called worse. Everything's fine with Elon,\" Navarro told broadcaster NBC on Sunday. \"Elon is doing a very good job with his team with waste, fraud and abuse. That's a tremendous contribution to America,\" he added of Musk's aggressive cost-cutting through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Navarro had taken aim at Tesla after the billionaire Musk, who also owns SpaceX, proposed a free-trade zone between the US and Europe. The economist claimed Tesla mostly assembled components like batteries and motors shipped in from factories in Asia. Those are exactly the types of jobs Trump says his trade offensive is designed to bring back to America. Musk retorted with studies he said showed \"Tesla has the most American-made cars.\" \"Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,\" he added -- referring to a fictional pundit Navarro quoted in a series of books and a policy memo, using an anagram of his own name. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt tried last week to play down the public feud, saying that \"boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue.\" Elon musk President donald trump \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

Queens Councilman Robert Holden said he doesn\u2019t want his neighborhood to turn into a potential \u201cmini-Chernobyl\u201d The site, which is now vacant at 64-30 69th Place, stands next to a daycare and preschool (Books & Rattles, Inc.), the Juniper Valley Animal Hospital and also lies across the street from PS 128. NineDot Energy spokesperson Karen Alter, when contacted by The Post, said the Brooklyn-based firm had not made a \u201cfinal decision on moving forward.\u201d In a copy of emails with community officials obtained by The Post, NineDot rep Sam Brill defended the safety of such battery sites, including a NineDot battery facility in the Bronx, that for years has \u201csafely operated\u201d 40 feet from a public school. \u201cFDNY wouldn\u2019t let us build these if they weren\u2019t safe,\u201d Brill said.

Archive Magazine Save this story Save Save this story Save The wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk , celebrated on his social media site X late Friday, writing that the \u201cpronoun bs is finally going away.\u201d \u201cThat was silly,\u201d Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency and has been slashing crucial federal funding for months, wrote after reposting a pronoun knock-knock joke. \u201cThank god Trump won,\u201d a user named TheDogeGlory replied below Musk\u2019s post, to which he responded with a bullseye emoji. Musk\u2019s post comes days after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that administration officials would refrain from responding to inquiries from journalists who include their preferred pronouns in email signatures or bios. \u201cAs a matter of policy,\u201d Leavitt wrote in an email from a reporter asking about the closure of a research observatory , \u201cwe do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk arrives on stage at an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Samuel Corum/Getty Images President Donald Trump \u2019s administration, in January, instructed federal employees to remove any reference to their identifying pronouns from their email signatures and other forms as a part of the broad effort to roll back any and all evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Or, as a Texas state employee found out , get fired. Leavitt\u2019s admission this week confirms that the press office is following suit. \u201cAny reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,\u201d the press secretary, who in just a few short months since Trump has taken office has gained a reputation as combative toward both individual journalists and legacy media in general, said in a separate statement to other news outlets. Axios also confirmed on Wednesday that officials will continue to skirt these reporters, asking Trump spokesperson Harrison Fields if that was now their official policy. \u201cFACTS!\u201d he replied. As The New York Times reported this week, \u201cOn at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters\u2019 questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.\u201d A spokesperson for the Times said, \u201cEvading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d they continued, \u201crefusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration\u2019s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025. JIM WATSON/Getty Images In one instance, Matt Berg , a reporter at Crooked Media, the network that runs the \u201cPod Save America\u201d family of podcasts, decided to experiment with the new administration\u2019s handling of journalists who include their pronouns. Berg doesn\u2019t usually include pronouns in his email signature. But, when he included \u201che/him\u201d in an email to Katie Miller , a senior adviser at DOGE, he too was met with a response claiming that the use of pronouns is detrimental to science, that it was her policy to refuse to respond to journalists with listed pronouns, and that he was ignoring facts. \u201cI find it baffling that they care more about pronouns than giving journalists accurate information, but here we are,\u201d Berg said in an email to the Times . The press office has previously been harsh on reporters who do not use the language they prefer. In February, Leavitt and the administration blocked The Associated Press from covering multiple White House events because it refused to change its editorial style from \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds and won\u2014though the White House said it would be appealing. Dozens of protesters gather in Times Square near a military recruitment center to show their anger at President Donald Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017 in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The White House\u2019s handling of pronouns aligns with the president\u2019s coordinated rollback of protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans and those who support them. Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people. In his first moments in office, the president signed an order declaring that the United States would only recognize two sexes, \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale,\u201d as defined at conception\u2014a move that required government agencies to use an outdated and scientifically inaccurate gender binary on documents like passports, visas, and employee records. He also signed others aimed at barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls\u2019 sports teams, restricting funding for gender-affirming care for people under 19, and removing transgender service members from the military. Multiple of Trump\u2019s orders against transgender people are being challenged in the courts. For Musk, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s discussed preferred pronouns on X, formerly Twitter. In 2022, he wrote , \u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.\u201d And in June of 2023, on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he would allow users to intentionally misgender someone without consequence. He also claimed that he personally would use the pronouns that someone prefers for manners\u2019 sake\u2014something he has repeatedly chosen not to do with his own daughter .

Agencies Confidential internal documents leaked following a cyberattack on NetJets, the private aviation firm owned by Berkshire Hathaway. They have reportedly exposed a detailed in-flight service guide tailored exclusively for Elon Musk on private jets, offering rare insight into the billionaire\u2019s airborne lifestyle, as per a report by Bloomberg. The document, first reported by Bloomberg, provides flight attendants with precise instructions on how to cater to the personal and professional preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, reflecting the meticulous attention given to his comfort and routine while in transit. Speed, Silence and Solitude: Inside the Jet Cabin According to the hacked manual, Elon Musk prefers direct and rapid routes regardless of fuel efficiency, a somewhat paradoxical position for the head of an electric vehicle empire known for sustainability. \u201cMr. Musk isn\u2019t interested in conserving fuel,\u201d the memo states, noting that his priority is to \u201cfly as quickly and as direct as possible.\u201d Live Events Onboard, the environment is kept controlled to Musk\u2019s liking: a cool cabin temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, dimmed lighting, and passenger vents turned off due to his aversion to background noise. Unexpected Wi-Fi dropouts are to be avoided at all costs, and staff are advised not to offer unsolicited help with technology, as Musk considers himself \u201cself-sufficient.\u201d Gaming in the Sky: Musk\u2019s Late-Night Livestreams Beyond the logistics of luxury travel, Musk has been using his time in the air to test Starlink\u2019s airborne connectivity, streaming video games from his private jet to millions of viewers. In a recent livestream that attracted over 16 million views, Musk played for 44 minutes, occasionally commenting on topics ranging from turbulence and artificial intelligence to the upcoming season of \"Diablo IV.\" Speaking into the camera in the early hours of April 10, he reflected on personal challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a stressful week, frankly. But today was a good day,\u201d Musk said, moments before resuming gameplay. These livestreams, often broadcast under his alias @cyb3rgam3r420, have become a regular feature of his travel routine, even showing glimpses of his son or spontaneous thoughts about Roman military history or Tesla\u2019s future tech ventures. Gaming Under Scrutiny Despite the casual tone of these videos, Musk has faced criticism within the gaming community. A previous exchange with a YouTuber, NikoWrex, suggested Musk may have considered \"account boosting\" \u2014 a controversial practice where gamers pay others to improve their rankings. The allegation drew ire from gamers and even prompted snark from official game accounts. Musk, while never officially commenting on the claims, did amplify the video in question. However, critics argue that his recent \u201chardcore mode\u201d failures during livestreams \u2014 including multiple in-game deaths and connection issues \u2014 cast doubt on his self-professed gaming prowess. FAQs What was leaked in the NetJets cyberattack? Internal documents from NetJets, a private aviation company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, were leaked following a cyberattack. These include a confidential service guide specifically tailored for Elon Musk, offering detailed insight into his travel preferences and routines aboard private jets. What does the guide reveal about Elon Musk\u2019s travel preferences? Musk prefers fast, direct flights regardless of fuel efficiency. He also requires a cabin temperature of 65\u00b0F, dim lighting, and no use of passenger air vents to reduce background noise. Flight attendants are instructed not to offer tech assistance unless asked.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any \u201cfurther unlawful and unfair action\u201d against OpenAI in a court case over the company\u2019s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution. OpenAI claims that Musk has tried \u201cnonstop\u201d to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using \u201cbad-faith tactics\u201d against it to help him control AI technology. Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a \u201cfor-profit\u201d company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity. OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now and 9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today \u201cThrough press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk\u2019s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI\u2019s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,\u201d In response, Musk\u2019s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI. \u201cHad OpenAI\u2019s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It\u2019s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI\u2019s assets allegedly \u2018interferes\u2019 with their business plans.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): AI Vision Versus EV Weakness - Goldman Balances Long-Term Hopes with Near-Term Risks Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On April 10, Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cNeutral\u201d and cut its price target on the stock to $260 per share from $275. \u201cFor Tesla , we believe that weaker auto demand/consumer sentiment, tariff costs (including in Energy), and US EV policy risk are offset by longer-term potential from its AI related efforts;\u201d Overall, TSLA ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries.

Elon Musk. Elon Musk has been steadily losing popularity among Americans, according to claims made by pollster Nate Silver in his latest tracker. However, Silver's assessment has drawn sharp retort from Tesla CEO Musk who blasted the ratings as \"political propaganda war\". \"We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125,\" Silver posted on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter). Replying to Silver's tweet, Musk wrote, \"The inevitable outcome of having a political propaganda war waged against me while I have almost no countervailing campaign and, at times, digging my own grave way better than my enemies do.\" Silver \"Do Americans have a favorable or unfavorable view of Elon Musk\" tracker shows statistics from January 1, 2024 till April 1, 2025. The timeline comprises Musk's endorsement for then Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, US President elections, and Donald Trump's inauguration and subsequent decisions that Trump administration has taken. Earlier on Thursday, two U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers on Thursday asked the Transportation Department's top ethics official to detail how the agency is addressing Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest given ongoing investigations of SpaceX and Tesla, companies run by the close ally of President Donald Trump. Live Events Meanwhile, Ireland's data privacy watchdog said on Friday it's investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X over its use of personal data to train his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. The Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into \"the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts\" that European users posted on X. FAQs Q1.

In a bold interview with EFN, Gardell called Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and pointed to slowing sales, Elon Musk\u2019s political drama, and Cybertruck struggles as red flags. While Tesla leads in EV innovation, Gardell warns the bubble could soon burst. Swedish billionaire Christer Gardell warns Tesla stock may crash 95%. He says the valuation is unrealistic and linked to Elon Musk\u2019s controversies, falling sales, and Cybertruck struggles Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell has issued a stark warning that\u2019s now catching the attention of Tesla investors worldwide. According to Gardell, Tesla\u2019s market valuation is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and could plummet by up to 95% \u2014 and possibly sooner than many might expect. In a recent interview with Swedish finance channel EFN, Gardell didn\u2019t hold back. He pointed to a mix of slowing sales, rising controversy around CEO Elon Musk, and what he sees as wildly overinflated stock value. Why is Christer Gardell calling Tesla\u2019s valuation a ticking time bomb? Tesla's current market value sits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But Gardell, who runs activist hedge fund Cevian Capital, says that figure doesn\u2019t align with Tesla\u2019s core business. \u201cTesla, especially now with the whole Musk circus going on everywhere, is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now,\u201d Gardell said in the EFN interview, as reported by Teslarati . \u201cIt could go down 95% \u2013 and maybe it should go down 95%.\u201d He clarified that it\u2019s hard to predict an exact timeline \u2014 \u201cIt could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years,\u201d he said. But in his eyes, a drop is coming. And when it hits, it could be steep. Live Events What\u2019s driving fears of a Tesla stock crash? Tesla has moved beyond just being an electric carmaker. The company now deals in robotics and AI, which are both major growth areas. But Gardell emphasized that, at its core, Tesla is still an automaker \u2014 and compared to its peers, its stock is way out of proportion. According to Companies Market Cap , Tesla\u2019s valuation is more than triple that of major auto giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Yet, Tesla\u2019s recent sales trends are not keeping up. Sales have dipped in key markets, and the controversial public presence of Elon Musk hasn\u2019t helped. As political tensions around Musk grow \u2014 especially in the U.S. \u2014 some analysts worry that Tesla\u2019s reputation could be taking a long-term hit. That\u2019s not just bad PR; it could mean real consequences for investor confidence. On top of that, Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated Cybertruck is underperforming. While Musk once projected annual sales of 500,000 units, current figures suggest it\u2019s not even hitting 10% of that. To move the product, Tesla has been forced to adjust financing options and offer more attractive interest rates to buyers. Could a Tesla crash ripple through the EV market? Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV market continues to thrive. In fact, Q4 2024 saw a new record for EV sales in the U.S., according to Cox Automotive . People are still switching to electric vehicles in large numbers, attracted by long-term savings and environmental benefits. But here\u2019s the concern: If Tesla's valuation tanks, will it scare investors away from other EV companies too? It's a real risk. Gardell's worry is that an overvalued company like Tesla might damage broader investor trust in green tech if it falls too hard and too fast. Still, it's not all bad news for EV buyers. As Tesla trims prices and tweaks financing to maintain demand, competitors may follow suit. That could lead to better deals for consumers, not just from Tesla but across the EV landscape. Should investors start looking beyond U.S. tech stocks? Gardell believes the stock market imbalance between the U.S. and Europe is reaching historic levels. \u201cThe difference between American stocks and European stocks has never been greater,\u201d he told EFN. For cautious investors, this may be a moment to reconsider their strategy. European equities, in his view, are offering more realistic valuations. And with companies in Europe also expanding into the EV and clean energy space, there may be opportunities to invest in future-forward industries without the same bubble risk. FAQs: Why did Christer Gardell warn about a Tesla stock crash ? He said Tesla\u2019s value is too high and could drop by 95%. How could Tesla\u2019s stock affect the electric vehicle market? A crash could shake investor trust in EV companies.

In his spare time, James is a long-suffering Rochdale fan and loves reading, running and music. Contact him via [email protected] X @ JimmyMoorhouse Advert Advert Advert Love him or hate him, Elon Musk has been part of some pretty wild projects over the years. Having one of his own cars up in space is perhaps one of the most random. While the Space X founder has lost plenty on Tesla stock in recent months, with Donald Trump 's tariffs only leaving more holes in his pocket , he remains the world's richest man and probably doesn't blink twice when a couple of million evaporates from his bank account. The businessman has taken on more of a political role since Trump's return to the Oval Office. This has hardly done much for the 53-year-old's controversial image, and it seems as though the South African's best work has been beyond Earth's orbit, given the success of various space projects over the years. Running a space company and a car business simultaneously, if you've got a mind like Musk, it's likely you'd put two and two together and send a Tesla up to the stars - and that's exactly what he did in 2018. Advert The Tesla Roadster was ejected into space as a dummy payload for a Falcon Heavy test flight. It's fitted with a mannequin in a space suit called Starman - a tongue-in-cheek nod to the David Bowie classic. The Bowie song Space Oddity was also set up to play on repeat through the vehicle's sound system. The SpaceX team also chucked a Hot Wheels car and a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside for good measure. Elon Musk (Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk previously revealed exactly why he sent the Tesla Roadster skyward, saying that he hoped that humanity would end up living on other planets and that his 'descendants will be able to drag it [the car] back to a museum'. The chances of that may seem pretty low, but the more kids Musk has, the more those chances improve. Musk has also said that he wanted to put the 'silliest' thing he and his SpaceX team could think of out of Earth's orbit, and apparently they settled on a car. Gosh, Elon, your imagination knows no bounds! Anyway, after seven years in space travelling at speeds well above 10,000 mph, you might think that it's tricky to keep track of the Roadster, but fortunately, like nearly everything these days, there's a website for that. Advert The \u2018Where is Roadster?\u2019 site keeps track of the Tesla as it zooms through space. At the time of writing, it is currently 228,647,460 miles from Earth. However, it's travelling back towards its home planet at the lightning-fast speed of 16,106 mph. A real space oddity... (SpaceX via Getty Images) That means that its speed has increased by 5,000 mph in the last week alone. Maybe it's homesick and wants to get back in time for Christmas, learning an important lesson from the NASA astronauts who end up spending far too long away from Earth. So what happens when the space car does finally come back home? Well, Musk could land himself in real trouble if the Tesla does crash land back to Earth. As long as it steers clear of any humans or man-made objects and doesn't cause any damage, it seems as if the billionaire will get away with it. Hopefully it avoids the likes of Mount Kilimanjaro and Niagara Falls, too.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially , and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk\u2019s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn\u2019t about a quick return on investment. It\u2019s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it a grift , pointing to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising and underdelivering . But the market is increasingly more tolerant \u2013 welcoming, even \u2013 of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president\u2019s right-hand men. \u201cAll of Elon\u2019s companies today are basically one company,\u201d Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.\u201d The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that \u201cevery single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,\u201d as Baron phrased it . Other businesses under Musk\u2019s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink \u2013 some of which reportedly share resources . \u201cWhen [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there\u2019s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok [\u2026] and you\u2019re gonna have connected cars all around the world? [\u2026] All these businesses link up. It\u2019s the ecosystem. It\u2019s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it\u2019s really interesting when you look at it that way.\u201d Baron Capital has invested across Musk\u2019s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire\u2019s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk\u2019s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren\u2019t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true when it comes to Musk\u2019s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it has automaker margins , based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \u201cThe reason why [Tesla\u2019s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it\u2019s not about what happens to numbers this year,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s one of Elon\u2019s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.\u201d Munster\u2019s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It\u2019s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X\u2019s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI\u2019s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland\u2019s DPC , which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe\u2019s GDPR law. \u201cAnother kind of risk here is that there isn\u2019t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you\u2019re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,\u201d Wang said. \u201cA lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information [\u2026] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.\u201d Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere for the last several months, Elon\u2019s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.\u201d When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they\u2019re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI\u2019s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. \u201cWe\u2019re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the value [\u2026] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?\u201d Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren\u2019t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk\u2019s superpower to \u201cbend capital markets to his will\u201d in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. \u201cThe people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,\u201d Rechtman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.\u201d Not for nothing, buying into Musk\u2019s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. \u201cSpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon\u2019s good graces.\u201d Topics AI , Elon Musk , Grok , Social , X , xAI Rebecca Bellan Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.
