It's not a myth. Some really do react \"as a way to minimise the expansion of other food from other cultures.\" this bit I really don't believe at all, sorry. Really doubt there was an organised attempt to minimize other cultures' food due to MSG myths. Shiroi Okami on 14/04/2025 - 23:18 +21 Do the people in your family also react to any kind of instant noodles, chips, packet soups, stock, fast food, frozen meals, soy, barbecue, oyster sauce, or gravy powder? What about foods that naturally contain it, like aged cheese, tomatoes, shiitake or enoki mushrooms, seaweed, soy products, meat, fish, green tea, fermented foods, or breast milk? jv on 14/04/2025 - 23:30 Comment score below threshold. Alcaro on 14/04/2025 - 23:33 +4 @jv: It's about hitting a critical mass and exceeding personal tolerances. Nothing to do with it being added or not. jv on 14/04/2025 - 23:44 -8 @Alcaro: Nothing to do with it being added or not. That's just your opinion. I'm talking about facts \u2026 CommanderCrumbcake on 15/04/2025 - 06:17 +11 @jv: How about scientific facts then? Controlled studies show that symptoms like nausea or headaches aren't reproducible under blinded conditions. FSANZ's technical report found no health risks at normal consumption levels: https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/sites/default/files/consume\u2026 So may I suggest you\u2019re likely dealing with either a placebo response or are regularly consuming highly processed foods with excessive added MSG, which is a separate issue. tenpercent on 15/04/2025 - 07:08 @CommanderCrumbcake: Interesting The FASEB evaluation concluded that sufficient evidence exists to indicate some individuals may experience manifestations of CRS when exposed to a \u22653g bolus dose of MSG in the absence of food. In addition, they concluded there may be a small number of unstable asthmatics who respond to doses of 1.5 \u2013 2.5g of MSG in the absence of food. Wolfenstein98k on 15/04/2025 - 13:54 +1 @tenpercent: Who consumes that much \"in the absence of food\"? That amount might be added to a huge wok full of fried rice, but then you need to eat a huge wok full of fried rice, and that will cause reactions in lots of people. That's a huge amount of sodium and insulin. tenpercent on 15/04/2025 - 13:58 +1 @Wolfenstein98k: Better question: why do scientists (or people funding scientists) get studies set up in such unrealistic ways so that we can't draw any valid conclusions that reflect how reasonable people might use the ingredient? Wolfenstein98k on 15/04/2025 - 15:39 +1 @tenpercent: Well that is an example where they used a massive dose to see if there was a threshold of effect. If 0.1% of people claim to turn blue when they eat vegetables, the only way to really test that is to give your treatment group a massive dose of vegetables and see if any of them turn blue. If they do, then you can conclude that there IS a threshold where vegetable exposure causes Smurfness and it's just a matter of dose and sensitivity. Otherwise, if your sample only captures 99.5% of people and you give them a normal dose, you would likely miss that 0.1% of people. King Tightarse on 14/04/2025 - 23:55 @Shiroi Okami Possibly - I don't know, but the thing with allergies and intolerances, they may be easy to ridicule or dismiss by those that don't have them or have never experienced them, when simply compared to their own lived experience of having never reacted. I can eat peanuts and peanut butter all day long, but it's a reasonably common allergen for some and can even invoke anaphylaxis in others. CommanderCrumbcake on 15/04/2025 - 06:21 +6 @King Tightarse: You're comparing a well-documented, IgE-mediated allergy like peanuts to MSG 'sensitivity', which has repeatedly failed to show consistent effects in blinded trials Lived experience matters, but reproducibility matters more TEER3X on 15/04/2025 - 07:12 +2 @CommanderCrumbcake: Lived experience matters, but reproducibility matters more Not to the individual that it actually affects. Wolfenstein98k on 15/04/2025 - 13:55 +2 @TEER3X: Except that research can show the individual that it's placebo they're experiencing. It matters if you're reacting to Compound X, or if you're just reacting to a perception. TEER3X on 15/04/2025 - 16:46 -1 @Wolfenstein98k: MSG symptom complex might be a real thing. You would have to assume most people who believe they are sensitive to msg don't go out looking to run experiments on themselves, on a frequent basis anyway. Wolfenstein98k on 15/04/2025 - 16:49 @TEER3X: And when they do, it's usually not a blind ABX. People who do these on themselves usually disprove their theory. Etherkai on 15/04/2025 - 05:51 +2 Can confirm, my mum is ethnic Chinese and gets pretty badly affected by MSG. tenpercent on 15/04/2025 - 07:04 +1 Is she racist against herself? /s loksmack on 15/04/2025 - 09:20 My grandmother has been 'alergic' to MSG for years. She has had several medical episodes requiring ambulance etc. Funnily enough she was absolutely fine when MSG was added to a non-Asian dish that a relative cooked without my grandmothers knowledge. Wolfenstein98k on 15/04/2025 - 13:52 +3 The placebo effect is strong. Some people break out in hives when consuming the sugar pill in a trial, but can eat sugar. Does sugar cause hives in some people, or only when it has a name like \"sucrose\"? King Tightarse on 15/04/2025 - 21:23 Do you believe that those who claim to be effected by MSG are simply suffering a delusion or some kind of placebo effect? Is that your position? If that is your position, PubMed has news for you: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10926854/#:~:text=T\u2026 . From the article: 'Typically, a dose of MSG of 2.5 g or less causes no symptoms in nonallergic people; larger doses can cause a burning sensation, facial pressure, headache, and drowsiness, but these symptoms usually dissipate within 4 h' This confirms, as widely reported, that some people can be allergic and there seems to be a distinct threshold with symptoms appearing in allergic individuals after ingesting three grams or more. G-rig on 15/04/2025 - 05:38 +1 This crap is posted every week or two, same arguments and opinions lol. I think the takeaway is to use very sparingly, everyone knows it isn't healthy (mainly high in sodium) and addictive, used in a lot of cheap takeaway and instant noodles etc. Better off learning how to cook. https://www.ozbargain.com.au/search/node/Ajinomoto%20MSG%20S\u2026 Wolfenstein98k on 15/04/2025 - 13:56 +3 It's not high in sodium - it supplants sodium. People can easily halve their sodium intake by replacing it with salt + MSG, because MSG is much \"stronger\" in flavour properties due to the glutamate. As a result, less total sodium produced the same flavour outcome. G-rig on 15/04/2025 - 16:41 most instant food has both though.. and do you think people actually put a pinch in? fkn same shit every time these are posted, everyone is acting like it's the first time it's being discussed haha ToBe on 15/04/2025 - 06:15 +3 when I was in school in the early 90s, I can't remember what the discussion was but I said MSG made food taste good. The teacher said sternly to me \"MSG kills people\". Ironically she smoked. G-rig on 15/04/2025 - 06:44 +1 Should have asked her to back that up with some proof. Red and processed meat kills people, but you don't see warning signs on those packaged goods. Mostly lifestyle and dietary choices are to blame for people's illness but there are plenty of studies and scientific results around these days - up to the individual if they want to believe them or change. Homr on 14/04/2025 - 23:03 is this yum yum? TEER3X on 15/04/2025 - 07:12 Yes. I love that guys videos. He's a legend. doogiechap on 14/04/2025 - 23:14 +2 Excellent episode of This American Life that addreses the mystery around MSG - truth is stranger than fiction!! https://www.thisamericanlife.org/668/transcript jv on 14/04/2025 - 23:27 -7 Good deal for those not allergic to it\u2026 marcozmitch on 15/04/2025 - 08:42 Any recipes of added flavourings to leave added to it? Like roasted seaweed or sesame, dried onions, chilli powder, pepper? Version of basic stock powder? (likely on-line, but for people to consider\u2026) jv on 15/04/2025 - 09:30 Any recipes Any French recipe\u2026 tenpercent on 15/04/2025 - 07:09 -3 No one was allergic to peanut butter back in my day so anyone trying to link it to allergic reactions is a racist /s marcozmitch on 15/04/2025 - 08:52 Part of the problem is the actual rarity of allergies: [Deaths from anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, remain relatively rare, with studies suggesting mortality rates ranging from 0.5 to 5.5 per million population. These deaths are often linked to medications, insect stings, or, less frequently, foods]\u2026 Which are increasing: experts acknowledging this trend and attributing it to various factors, including environmental changes and lifestyle shift. Not sure if tenpercent is referring to this \"In Australia, children born to parents who were born in Asia have higher rates of food allergies compared to non-Asian children.\" tenpercent on 15/04/2025 - 09:13 Not sure if tenpercent is referring to this No I was not. I don't know where you are even quoting that from. I was actually alluding to the usual MSG commentary that goes something like this (sometimes in a different order like it did above)\u2026 JV: I have reactions to it. Other person: No you don't. JV: Actually I do. Other person: Well you're basically racist for even thinking that MSG might give you headaches or cause any other negative experiences. Crow K on 15/04/2025 - 09:19 +1 The best jokes are the ones that require detailed explanations with footnotes/links. tenpercent on 15/04/2025 - 09:38 @Crow K: Ka kaw.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. By Gizmodo Deals Published April 14, 2025 | \ud835\udd4f Copied! \u00a9 Amazon AirTags have been a godsend for those who have a habit of misplacing their belongings: Whether it\u2019s your keys, wallet, bag or luggage (or even your pet\u2019s collar), these small Bluetooth trackers offer a simple and effective solution to keep track of your belongings. Amazon is now offering great discounts on the single AirTag unit and the 4-pack set which it an excellent time to pick up this handy device. Though these prices aren\u2019t all-time lows, they\u2019re near enough to low to make this offer very attractive\u2014especially with word on the street that tariffs might double the price of electronics any time soon. The individual AirTag is now just $24 (orig. $29) , and the 4-pack bundle can be had for $79 (orig. $99) . Both options are Top 5 bestsellers in Amazon\u2019s Electronics category right now. See 4-pack AirTags at Amazon See single AirTag at Amazon Very Useful Tracker The AirTag is a tiny attachment that makes finding lost items simple: It\u2019s very simple to set up\u2014just tap it to your iPhone or iPad , assign the AirTag a name for what you\u2019re using it for (such as \u201cKeys\u201d or \u201cBackpack\u201d) and you\u2019re ready to go. When linked to your Apple ID, the AirTag cooperates with the Find My app to display its location on a map in real time. If the item is nearby but not in sight, you can use Precision Finding on recent iPhones that have Ultra Wideband technology for a very precise location with on-screen directions and sound. Or you can have the AirTag play a sound from its built-in speaker to locate it in seconds. One of the unique features of the AirTag is that it is able to leverage Apple\u2019s vast Find My network which is composed of hundreds of millions of devices across the globe. When you misplace something outside the home (at a hotel or airport, for example), the AirTag can transmit its location anonymously through nearby Apple devices and back to you via iCloud. This feature makes your items trackable even when they\u2019re out of Bluetooth range . Obviously, privacy and security are also important aspects of the AirTag design: The device uses encrypted communication to protect your data and prevent unwanted tracking. Moreover, if someone attempts to use an AirTag to track you against your will, your iPhone will detect and alert you if there are any unfamiliar trackers nearby. As fears mount over imminent tariff hikes that would essentially see electronics prices go through the roof, it\u2019s a great time to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s discounts. Purchasing AirTags today will ensure that you are not caught off guard by rising costs in the near future.

That\u2019s more than 50% off of its regular price, which does bring it down to an all-time low. This is the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked on the Q8 Max+ since it was announced. The Roborock Q8 Max+ stands out with 5,500Pa of suction power, making it a top-tier pick for pet owners and anyone needing deep daily cleaning. It\u2019s also a 2-in-1 vacuum and mop, using LiDAR navigation to map your home for room-by-room or zone cleaning intelligently. This model also includes Roborock\u2019s Auto-Empty Dock Pure, which takes care of dustbin emptying for you\u2014ideal if you\u2019re running it every day and don\u2019t want to touch the mess. It holds up to 7 weeks of debris in its dust bag and features multi-directional brushes to minimize tangles from pet hair. You can also set up customizable no-go zones to keep the robot from cleaning specific areas and set cleaning schedules in the Roborock App. Roborock has also included its auto-lifting mop technology here, so it can seamlessly transition from hard floors to carpet. Without dragging the dirty and wet mop all over your carpeted floors. If you\u2019re looking to get a robot vacuum that won\u2019t cost an arm and a leg, then the Q8 Max+ is a really good option.

This launch will feature the company\u2019s first all-female crew aboard its suborbital rocket, New Shepard. The mission highlights Blue Origin\u2019s ongoing efforts to make space travel more inclusive, sustainable, and globally inspiring. Leading the crew is Lauren S\u00e1nchez, an Emmy-winning journalist, licensed pilot, and vice-chair of the Bezos Earth Fund. Joining her are global pop icon Katy Perry, CBS anchor Gayle King, former NASA engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Kerianne Flynn. The mission aims to celebrate women's contributions to science, media, and social change, while encouraging young girls to dream beyond Earth's boundaries. The brief yet significant flight will reach the edge of space\u2014about 62 miles above Earth\u2014offering the crew a few minutes of weightlessness before a safe parachute-assisted landing. Beyond its scientific and symbolic significance, the mission blends space with culture. The all-female crew will wear custom-designed suits by Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim of Oscar de la Renta and Monse, created in collaboration with Creative Character Engineering\u2014showcasing a fusion of technology, empowerment, and design. This launch follows Blue Origin's past high-profile missions, including flights carrying Jeff Bezos, William Shatner, and Wally Funk, and further cements the company\u2019s role in shaping the future of space tourism. With the NS-31 mission, Blue Origin is not only expanding access to space but also turning it into a platform for powerful representation and inspiration. The event will be streamed live, attracting a global audience eager to witness this groundbreaking moment in space history. 00:00 (IST) Apr 15 Katy reflects on the love and meaning of her space journey In an interview after returning to Earth from space, Katy Perry shared that the experience made her realize how much love she had to offer and how loved they all were. She also described it as the most meaningful experience of her life. 23:30 (IST) Apr 14 Gayle King overcomes fear and remains calm after spaceflight Gayle King, after returning to Earth from her 11-minute spaceflight aboard the NS-31, admitted that she had once been afraid and never dreamed of becoming an astronaut. However, she overcame her fears and remained calm during the landing. 23:00 (IST) Apr 14 Katy Perry reflects on space journey After returning from space, Katy Perry shared that the flight gave her a deep sense of belonging. She emphasized that it wasn't about reaching the destination, but rather the journey itself, which helped her appreciate life even more. 22:30 (IST) Apr 14 Lauren Sanchez defends Blue Origin mission Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos' fianc\u00e9e, expressed her wish that those criticizing the mission could witness the efforts at Blue Origin. She emphasized that many individuals had worked tirelessly behind the scenes, dedicating their hearts and souls to advancing science. 21:00 (IST) Apr 14 Blue Origin crew posing together after landing on Earth &mdash; davill (@davill) 20:07 (IST) Apr 14 Katy Perry reveals why she carried a daisy flower in her hand The experience has shown Katy Perry how much love is inside of her, she says, adding that you cannot know how much you are loved \u201cuntil the day you launch\u201d. According to the Guardian, Katy spoke about her daughter Daisy watching on and why she carried a daisy flower on the flight, \"Daisies are common flowers but they grow through any condition. They grow through cement, cracks, walls. They are resilient, they are strong, they are everywhere.Flowers, to me, are God\u2019s smile but they are also a reminder of our beautiful Earth. The beautiful magic is everywhere, all around us, even in a simple daisy. Speaking about singing \u2018What a Wonderful Life\u2019 on the descent, she says it\u2019s not about her and that \u201cit is all for the benefit of Earth\u201d. 19:57 (IST) Apr 14 Katy Perry kisses the ground as she exits the capsule Pic: Blue Origin X handle 19:46 (IST) Apr 14 Key stats from today\u2019s New Shepard crewed NS-31 mission: The Crew Capsule reached an apogee of 346,802 ft AGL / 350,449 ft MSL (106 km AGL / 107 km MSL).The booster reached an apogee of 346,481 ft AGL / 350,128 ft MSL (106 km AGL / 107 km MSL).Official launch time was 8:30:00 AM CDT / 13:30:00 UTC.Capsule landing occurred at 8:40:21 AM CDT / 13:40:21 UTC.The mission elapsed time was 10 min 21 sec. Blue Origin - X handle 19:45 (IST) Apr 14 Blue Origin launches all-female celebrity crew with Katy Perry, Gayle King, Lauren Sanchez Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched his fiancee Lauren Sanchez to space on Monday with an all-female celebrity crew that included Katy Perry and Gayle King. It was the latest wave in space tourism, where more of the rich and famous than ever before - or lucky and well-connected - can enter the zero-gravity realm traditionally dominated by professional astronauts. The New Shepard rocket blasted off on the quick up-and-down trip from West Texas. The fringes of space beckoned some 65 miles (105 kilometers) up, promising a few precious minutes of weightlessness. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and \"CBS Mornings\" co-host King. Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence. Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip comes two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice. It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin's first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad. The celebrity launch was the nation's first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963. That's when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet. Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 per cent of the more than 700 people who have travelled into space. Sanchez said she deliberately chose women to launch with her, each of them eager to inspire both the young and old to dream big, and even commissioned special flight suits. \"It's an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\" Perry told The Associated Press last week. The launch brought out VIPs to West Texas including Oprah Winfrey and several women who previously have flown on private flights. This isn't the first Blue Origin launch with marquee names. \"Star Trek\" actor William Shatner caught a lift to space with Blue Origin in 2021 at age 90, soon after Bezos' inaugural trip. He was followed by former New York Giants defensive end and TV host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the rocket is named. Two aviation pioneers who missed out on space when they were younger - Wally Funk and Ed Dwight - also rocketed away at ages 82 and 90, respectively. Most of Blue Origin's passengers - 58 counting the latest launch - have been business or science types, TV hosts or YouTubers. Ticket prices are not disclosed. The Russian Space Agency also has launched its share of space tourists, beginning with a California financier in 2001. Two decades later, a Russian actress filmed aboard the International Space Station. Elon Musk's SpaceX also sells multi-day trips to private customers. SpaceX's first client to fly, billionaire tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman already has launched twice and performed the first private spacewalk. He's now set to become NASA's next administrator if confirmed by the Senate. Chinese-born bitcoin investor Chun Wang just returned from the first spaceflight to carry people over the north and south poles. Wang picked up the whole SpaceX tab for himself and three polar explorers for an undisclosed sum. \"In this exciting new era of commercial spaceflight, the dream of becoming an astronaut is no longer limited to a select few,\" Wang said via X last week. 19:43 (IST) Apr 14 Katy Perry joins NS-31 crew for space journey &mdash; blueorigin (@blueorigin) 18:40 (IST) Apr 14 Blue Origin to fly Katy Perry to edge of space with all-female crew Pop star Katy Perry, along with five other females, is set to create history by touring to the edge of space on Jeff Bezos' aerospace venture Blue Origin's tourist mission on Monday evening. The six-member crew is expected to lift off on the company's reusable New Shepard rocket -- NS-31 -- from Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:30 a.m. CDT (7:00 pm IST). The 11th human flight to suborbital space will last 11 minutes and will fly above the Karman line -- the internationally recognised boundary of space. \"I've dreamt of going to space for 15 years and tomorrow that dream becomes a reality,\" Perry shared in a post, along with a video, on Instagram. \"I am so honoured to be alongside five other incredible and inspiring women as we become the first ever all-female flight space crew!\" she added. In the video, she gave her fans a sneak peek inside her space capsule and declared that she might sing in space. \"I think I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna sing in a little bit, I got to sing in space,\" she said. Besides Perry, the mission includes Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn, and Lauren Sanchez. \"This is the first all-female flight crew since Valentina Tereshkova's solo spaceflight in 1963,\" according to Blue Origin. While Perry is one of the best-selling music artists of all time and a philanthropist, Flynn is a film producer and philanthropist. King and Sanchez are award-winning journalists. Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist, will become the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman astronaut. Bowe is a former NASA rocket scientist, and the CEO of STEMBoard, an engineering firm. She is expected to conduct three research experiments, including studies on plant biology and human physiology -- advancing her mission to explore space for the benefit of Earth. The mission will be the second this year. So far, Blue Origin has flown 52 people above the Karman line. 18:20 (IST) Apr 14 Unseen footage shows Katy Perry preparing for space journey with NS-31 crew &mdash; todaykatyp (@todaykatyp) 18:12 (IST) Apr 14 \u201cI\u2019ve got to sing in space!\u201d Katy Perry 18:10 (IST) Apr 14 Katy Perry's participation in Blue Origin mission Katy Perry\u2019s participation in Blue Origin\u2019s NS-31 mission transcends celebrity spectacle\u2014it\u2019s a bold statement about possibility, representation, and the evolving narrative of space exploration.

Her enthusiasm extended beyond the launch pad\u2014she curated a personal playlist for the flight and embraced the mission\u2019s cultural significance, blending her artistic identity with a passion for exploration .\u200b By stepping into a space historically dominated by men, Perry helped redefine who belongs in the cosmos.

The six-member team included pop icon Katy Perry, journalist Lauren S\u00e1nchez, CBS anchor Gayle King, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. Departing from West Texas, the autonomous New Shepard spacecraft ascended beyond the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, allowing the crew to experience weightlessness during the approximately 11-minute journey. The mission emphasized both scientific exploration and cultural representation, with crew members like Nguyen conducting research and S\u00e1nchez curating the team for their storytelling prowess. Notably, the crew donned custom-designed, jewel-toned spacesuits by designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, blending fashion with space travel. The NS-31 mission not only advanced private space exploration but also highlighted the growing intersection of science, media, and diversity in space endeavors. 18:04 (IST) Apr 14 Katy Perry set for launch on all-female spaceflight today: \"I am SO honored\" - WATCH Pop star Katy Perry is set to blast off into space today on a groundbreaking spaceflight as part of Blue Origin\u2019s first all-female spaceflight mission, NS-31. The 10-minute suborbital trip aboard the rocket will mark a historic moment in space travel. With the clock counting down to the big takeoff on Monday morning, Katy took to Instagram to share her excitement. In a video, she shared a clip of the capsule in which she underwent training. \"I\u2019ve dreamt of going to space for 15 years, and tomorrow, that dream becomes a reality,\" she captioned the post. 18:03 (IST) Apr 14 Lauren Sanchez to visit space on fianc\u00e9 Jeff Bezos' rocket!

Sanchez is taking a trip to space, as part of her pre-wedding celebrations, along with her all-female passengers on board for the flight. Here\u2019s all you need to know about the all-female spaceflight. The all-female flight! It\u2019s not a new piece of information that Jeff Bezos is all set to get hitched this summer, with his long-time partner and fianc\u00e9e Lauren Sanchez, and all the hullabaloo around the heavyweight wedding has already started. Although the wedding is reportedly not before late June, the festivities are expected to start weeks before the actual wedding. Sanchez\u2019s flight to space in Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin rocket, with five more female guests, reportedly is part of that celebration! The private spaceflight company owned by Bezos had announced that Gayle King, Katy Perry, and Lauren S\u00e1nchez will join three other women on its upcoming mission, revealing that the 11th crewed flight, with an all-women crew, would board the New Shepard rocket. As reported by NBC News, a ticket for the ride in the Blue Origin Rocket goes into nothing short of six digits! The launch of Blue Origin New Shepard: Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle from the company's West Texas site on Monday, April 14. The launch window opens at 9:30 a.m. EDT, and can be watched live via the company. A livestream of the New Shepard launch will be available on Blue Origin's website 90 minutes before liftoff, and it will be simulcast on YouTube and the Blue Origin X account. Monday's mission is known as NS-31, because it will be the 31st flight to date for New Shepard, a reusable rocket-capsule combo. This will be the 11th crewed flight for New Shepard; the other missions have been uncrewed research jaunts. NS-31 will also be the first all-female spaceflight since June 16, 1963, when the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova launched on a three-day solo trip to Earth orbit. Who are on board NS-31 along with Lauren Sanchez? Apart from Bezos\u2019 fianc\u00e9e Sanchez, the other passengers of the Blue Origin all-female spaceflight are pop star Katy Perry, \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, author and bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Nguyen, STEMBoard CEO and former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. NS-31 is set to launch to suborbital space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle from the company's West Texas site on Monday. The space fashion: Only a few days ago, Perry posed in blue monogrammed suits alongside aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, journalist Gayle King, producer Kerianne Flynn, and activist Amanda Nguyen and shared the photos via Instagram, writing, \u201cHappy International Day of Human Space Flight. Forever in awe of the Universe and it\u2019s [sic] alignment.\u201d Sanchez had told Elle during an interview that she and her fellow passengers were planning to go glam before the flight, saying, \u201cWho would not get glam before the flight?!\u201d She quipped that there would be \u201clash extensions flying in the capsule.\u201d Bezos\u2019 fianc\u00e9e also explained that she doesn\u2019t have to worry about her lashes defying gravity, adding, \u201cMine are glued on. They\u2019re good,\u201d to which Perry added, \u201cSpace is going to finally be glam!\u201d On the other hand, Bowe explained that she had thoroughly planned her rocket launch look and did a test run on her hair to \u201cmake sure\u201d it would be OK, saying, \u201cI skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good \u2014 took it for a dry run.\u201d Nguyen chimed in that people need to see them with a full face of makeup, saying, \u201cThis dichotomy of engineer and scientist, and then beauty and fashion. We contain multitudes.\u201d She added, \u201cWomen are multitudes. I\u2019m going to be wearing lipstick.\u201d How long will the space trip be? Although Sanchez is getting an unprecedented pre-wedding gift from her husband-to-be, she and her fellow passengers won't be gone for nearly that long. New Shepard missions last just 10 to 12 minutes from liftoff to capsule touchdown. However, the NS-31 crew will get above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, the internationally recognized boundary of outer space, which lies 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth. The passengers will also get to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see our planet against the blackness of space. Blue Origin's New Shepard NS-31 mission achieved a historic milestone by launching an all-female crew into suborbital space. The six-member team included pop icon Katy Perry, journalist Lauren S\u00e1nchez, CBS anchor Gayle King, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguy\u1ec5n, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. This marked the first all-women spaceflight since Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963.\u200b Departing from West Texas on April 14, 2025, the autonomous spacecraft will ascend beyond the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, allowing the crew to experience weightlessness during the approximately 11-minute journey. The mission emphasized both scientific exploration and cultural representation, with crew members like Nguy\u1ec5n conducting research and S\u00e1nchez curating the team for their storytelling prowess. Notably, the crew donned custom-designed, jewel-toned spacesuits by designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, blending fashion with space travel. The NS-31 mission not only will advanced private space exploration but also highlight the growing intersection of science, media, and diversity in space endeavors.

It\u2019s not about getting more clicks \u2014 it\u2019s about getting more from every customer. CVO turns casual visitors into buyers, buyers into repeat customers, and makes every stage of your funnel more profitable. I\u2019ll walk you through the CVO system that has helped thousands of businesses generate sustainable revenue in the most competitive business climates. From there, you\u2019ll learn specific strategies you can use across the customer lifecycle to optimize value, and how to measure the impact of your efforts. What Is Customer Value Optimization? Customer Value Optimization is a data-driven process designed to maximize the lifetime value of each customer relative to how much it costs to acquire and keep them. The approach focuses on each step of the customer journey as an opportunity to increase the number of people who buy, their purchase frequency, what they spend on average, and how long they stay with your brand. As a concept, CVO emerged in the 2010s. Marketer Ryan Deiss popularized the term Customer Value Optimization by packaging it as a step-by-step process to improve the profitability at each stage of the funnel. CVO and its terminology \u2014 like tripwire offers and profit maximizers \u2014 gained traction in the digital marketing community, especially among ecommerce businesses looking for more sustainable growth. Since then, Customer Value Optimization has been widely adopted by DTC brands, SaaS companies, and local businesses like gyms and restaurants. Really, any business that is looking to move beyond one-off purchases and build customer value over the long-term is probably using a few of the CVO tactics I cover in this post. The System for Customer Value Optimization The core framework that Deiss put forward includes seven steps to build out a system that supports ongoing CVO. He starts at the very beginning: Determine product/market fit : Confirm that your product solves a real problem for a specific audience. Without a strong fit between what you offer and what people need, no amount of marketing will generate long-term value. Choose a traffic source : Identify where your target audience spends time and how they prefer to engage. Whether it\u2019s paid ads, organic search, or social media, pick one primary channel to focus your acquisition efforts. Master that channel before adding in others \u2014 don\u2019t spread yourself too thin before you know what works. Offer a lead magnet : Provide something valuable for free in exchange for contact information. An appealing lead magnet builds trust, ensures people are genuinely interested, and gives you permission to continue the conversation. Offer a tripwire : Present a low-priced, high-value item that\u2019s easy to say yes to. The goal isn\u2019t to profit on this offer \u2014 it\u2019s to convert someone from a casual visitor into a paying customer. This first transaction builds trust and opens the door to future purchases. Offer a core product : Once trust is established, introduce your main offer. This is the product or service that delivers your primary value and generates the bulk of your revenue. Offer a profit maximizer : Introduce relevant and timely offers for add-ons, premium versions, service bundles, or subscription options. These offers increase profitability without increasing your acquisition cost. Create the return path : Build systems to bring customers back through email marketing , loyalty programs, or replenishment reminders. Repeat customers are more profitable and easier to convert than new ones. The framework follows the customer throughout their entire lifecycle with the brand. A key intuition of CVO is that the sale is at the center of the lifecycle \u2014 not the end. To see why this is so valuable, let\u2019s walk through a quick real-world example. What CVO looks like in practice Consider a residential plumbing company that currently treats each repair call as a one-off transaction. Disaster strikes, the company responds, they get paid, and that\u2019s the end of the relationship. What if instead they offered service plans and with annual tune-ups and preventative maintenance? Because the company would get predictable revenue, they could offer customers a healthy discount on service and peace of mind about their property. Timing this profit maximizer offer in the immediate aftermath of a plumbing emergency is probably going to resonate. I use this example because I just signed up for such a service plan with a plumbing and HVAC company after getting my furnace tuned up. The tech didn\u2019t tell me about this offer until after he was done and we were doing the bill. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can get money off today\u2019s service and get on our calendar for your AC tuneup with a service plan.\u201d I was sold. He already had my trust and was able to offer me a good deal on future service. I went from being a $160 dollar visit to being a customer that will probably spend $4,000 with this company over the next ten years. This is just one small example for one type of company. Let\u2019s walk through ways you can optimize for customer value over the entire lifecycle. 7 Strategies for Optimizing Customer Value BEFORE you take steps to optimize customer value, ensure that your strategy is grounded in real, recent, and relevant data. I recommend: Conducting comprehensive market research to fill any gaps about your ideal customers, including their demographics, psychographics , behaviors, and purchasing habits. Developing a clear understanding of what your competitors are doing to identify opportunities and threats. Competitor keyword research is a quick way to see what they are spending money on and who they are targeting. Making sure that you are accurating tracking all of the key business metrics and funnel data that underpin your decision-making. Getting qualitative data via customer surveys and interviews to give you deeper insight into the motivations behind the quantitative data you collect. Old, incomplete, or unreliable data leads to poorly-informed decisions and missed opportunities. With good data, there should be clear areas of your funnel where there are opportunities to make improvements. Once you know what you want to work on, you can use these strategies to start going after specific objectives that are guaranteed to optimize customer value. 1. Increase traffic quality Focus on bringing in the kind of visitors who are actually likely to stick around, engage, and buy \u2014 more qualified traffic means less waste and more results. When you do really great work getting high-quality leads at the top of your funnel, it increases the odds you will generate revenue at every later stage. Conduct keyword research to optimize ad targeting so that it closely matches the intent of high-value prospects. Utilize lookalike audiences and retargeting on social media to attract relevant, high-quality visitors. Invest in high-quality content marketing tailored to the interests and questions of your ideal customers. 2. Decrease traffic costs The less you spend to get people customers on the page, the more value you get from every sale. All of the ad platforms give you tools to monitor your spend and ways to get more from every dollar. Regularly audit and pause low-performing ads or channels. Optimize ad bidding strategies to focus spending on the highest-converting audience segments. Use SEO strategies to increase organic traffic by improving your brands discoverability and visibility in search results. 3. Increase the conversion rate Small tweaks to messaging, layout, and flow can help you achieve a good conversion rate that makes your funnel much more profitable. The same number of customers will result in a higher number of purchases. Use well-known conversion rate optimization tactics to remove friction, confusion, and uncertainty from landing pages, checkout flows, and other high-value pages. Conduct A/B testing regularly to identify high-performing messages, designs, and calls to action. Use persuasion techniques like urgency, scarcity, and storytelling to motivate people to act. 4. Increase the percentage of high-value customers This is about attracting the kind of customers who move the needle \u2014 the ones who spend more, stick around, and actually fuel your growth. They\u2019re a small slice of your audience, but extremely lucrative. For many brands, 20% of customers account for 80% of the profits. Develop ICPs or customer personas based on detailed research to guide acquisition tactics. Employ targeted campaigns focused specifically on segments with the highest potential CLV. Segment existing customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis identify potential high-CLV customers in need of a nudge, or those on the verge of leaving. 5. Decrease churn / increase retention Keeping your customers happy is cheaper and more profitable than acquiring new ones. Every customer that decides to stay, or stays for longer, adds value in a meaningful way. Take proactive steps to listen to customers \u2014 use surveys, interviews, NPS or CSAT surveys \u2014 and act quickly on what you discover. Create loyalty programs that offer meaningful rewards to frequent purchasers. Educate existing users about how to get the most value out of your product to improve customer retention . 6. Increase AOV Raising your AOV means earning more revenue from the same number of customers \u2014 without increasing your traffic, acquisition costs, or marketing spend. It\u2019s one of the most efficient ways to grow your business, and the source of some of the biggest CVO wins in history. How much revenue has McDonalds added over the years by asking, \u201cWould you like fries with that?\u201d Suggest complementary products during checkout. Use personalized recommendations based on past purchases to offer relevant upsells and cross-sells. Create bundled offers or tiered discounts encouraging larger orders. 7. Improve customer experience Enhance overall satisfaction to foster stronger customer relationships, encourage repeat business, and generate positive word-of-mouth. Regularly audit and improve customer service processes, ensuring quick response times and effective problem resolution. Invest user experience (UX) by using heatmaps , learning from CES survey results, running usability testing \u2014 improvements to UX will almost always benefit customer experience. Empower your employees to provide better experiences with sufficient training, tools, and authority to resolve issues quickly. Measuring the Impact of Customer Value Optimization I would rate our CVO efforts by looking at a few key metrics and the direction they are trending: How much revenue are we generating per customer? The higher the better. How long do customers stay with us? The longer duration the better? How much are we spending to get new customers? Trending less is good. How much does it cost to maintain customers? Steady or trending down is good. The specific data you need to answer these questions depends on your business model. A software company that sells subscriptions tracks revenue differently from a gym that sells memberships \u2014 and both of those are very different from stores that sell individual products or service businesses working in the field. It makes sense, and you want to make sure that you are accurately modeling the revenues and costs associated with your customers. Defining customer lifetime value for your organization More than any other single metric, customer lifetime value (CLV) will help you figure out where you should focus your CVO efforts and how to judge the results. Now, CLV modeling is its own discipline that predates digital marketing by several decades. It can get wildly complex \u2014 just think about ginning up a CLV for Amazon Prime members, let alone Amazon customers writ large. Most people don\u2019t have as difficult a task. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to start with one of the simple, widely-used equations that people use for calculating customer lifetime value. Ecommerce : AOV \u00d7 Purchase Frequency \u00d7 Lifespan \u00d7 Gross Margin B2B : Annual Contract Value \u00d7 Contract Term \u00d7 Retention Rate SaaS : (ARPU \u00d7 Gross Margin) / Monthly Churn Rate Retail : Average Spend per Visit \u00d7 Visits per Month \u00d7 Lifespan Nonprofit : Avg Donation per Year \u00d7 Donor Lifespan \u00d7 Retention Rate Treat these equations as a starting point for figuring out how to most accurately determine and forecast CLV at your business. Not every B2B company should use ACV to determine customer lifetime value \u2014 for example, the traditional method I laid out above probably falls short of the mark for companies with usage-based pricing because it doesn\u2019t track actual value. You will find smart people who disagree completely about the best approaches to measuring and interpreting customer value. Example CVO Impact Calculation Let\u2019s walk through an actual calculation using a simplified real-world example that walks you through the problem, strategy, and results. Problem : An online skincare brand noticed most customers made a single purchase and never returned. With an average order value of $30 and gross margins of 80%, CLV hovered around $24. Strategy : The brand introduced a low-cost starter kit as a tripwire offer to attract first-time buyers with minimal risk. They followed up with a personalized email sequence that included upsells to full-size products and automated reminders for replenishment. Results : A significant lift in both average order value and purchase frequency, which increased CLV from $24 to $192. Let\u2019s plug some numbers into the standard ecommerce CLV equation, where: CLV = AOV \u00d7 Purchase Frequency \u00d7 Lifespan \u00d7 Gross Margin Initial metrics : Average Order Value : $30 Purchase frequency : once lifetime Lifespan : 1 (since the purchase only happens once, we\u2019ll treat this as 1) Gross margin : 80% CLV: $24 (30\u00d71\u00d71\u00d70.8=24) After implementing CVO tactics : Average Order Value: $40 Purchase frequency : 6 times per year Lifespan : 1 year (assuming they stick around for just that one year) Gross margin : 80% CLV : $192 (40\u00d76\u00d71\u00d70.8=192) For those keeping score at home, this is a sevenfold increase in customer lifetime value \u2014 all from increasing purchase frequency and AOV.

The Villans took a 35th-minute lead in Paris through Morgan Rogers, but their advantage lasted less than five minutes and PSG were ahead by the 49th as Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored in quick succession. Nuno Mendes\u2019 92nd-minute goal means Villa will start the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final 3-1 behind, but they have won four and drawn one of their home matches in this season\u2019s competition, keeping four clean sheets and winning by at least two goals on three occasions. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, but we have to feel strong at home and try to prepare as best as possible,\u201d said Emery, calling the decider a \u201cpossibility and opportunity\u201d. bet365 Champions League Winners Odds \u2013 Who Are The Favourites To Win the 2025 UCL? \u201c[We have to] try to transmit our energy, to get the supporters\u2019 energy and then play the best football. When we are playing this [season our] best football, we can [overcome challenges].\u201d Luis Enrique celebrated his 100th match in charge of PSG in the first leg, and the Spaniard was particularly pleased with his players\u2019 response to falling behind, which he described as a \u201cparticularly difficult moment for our confidence\u201d. \u201cIt was kind of a moment of doubt\u2026 the team showed personality and character,\u201d added the 54-year-old, who won the 2014/15 Champions League with Barcelona. \u201cWe always say that when you play a match of this importance, you have to control your emotions.

Widemen Andres Garcia and Donyell Malen both came on against the Saints but will drop out of the matchday squad because they have not been included in the club\u2019s European squad list. PSG were not in action at the weekend and the early Ligue 1 winners have a full squad to choose from as they attempt to reach the final for a second consecutive campaign. Fabian Ruiz must avoid a booking if the Spain midfielder is to be available for a potential semi-final first leg.

PSG lost their subsequent Champions League away game 1-0 at Bayern Munich but have been in serene form on the road since then, thrashing Salzburg, Stuttgart and Brest before edging past the team with by far the best home record in the Premier League when they won 1-0 at Liverpool before prevailing on penalties. They have had three extra days\u2019 rest and will go through if they repeat the defensive resolve they showed at Anfield, although Villa, who have scored at least twice in 10 of their last 12 games in all competitions, are likely to attack aggressively from the outset. The extra risks Villa will take could result in a high-scoring draw, with two goals apiece sending PSG through. Aston Villa F.C. , Paris Saint-Germain F.C.

The NS-31 mission marked the 11th human flight of Jeff Bezos' New Shepard program . \"I can't even believe what I saw,\" marveled \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King after returning from the roughly 10-minute journey. She joined pop superstar Katy Perry, journalist and philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, and civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen on Blue Origin's historic trip to space. Bowe is the first Bahamian and Nguyen the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space. They joined a small group of 52 prior passengers with the New Shepard program who have made the quick trip to space. This is the first all-women crew to lift off in nearly six decades, following Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's solo spaceflight, Blue Origin said . Blue Origin's first all-women crew blasts off Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket carrying astronauts Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguy\u1ec5n, Kerianne Flynn, Gayle King, Katy Perry, and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, lifts off from Launch Site One north of Van Horn, Texas. Justin Hamel / Getty Images The all-women Blue Origin flight crew lifted off on time Monday morning, around 9:30 a.m. ET. You could hear screams of awe inside the capsule as the rocket blasted off and headed toward the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. \"I got chills. I got tears in my eyes...the enormous burst of sound,\" described \"CBS Mornings\" featured host Vladimir Duthiers as he watched the rocket disappear into the sky, later saying he could hear King marvel, \"Oh, look at that,\" from inside the rocket. At the apex of the mission, the passengers were in microgravity, meaning they experienced weightlessness. They unbuckled and floated in the capsule for about 4 minutes before returning to their seats. \"I thought I heard Katy Perry singing up there, and listen, she had a lot to sing about,\" CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassman commented after the launch. King confirmed Perry sang Louis Armstrong's \"What A Wonderful World.\" The booster then made its way back to Earth, landing upright about 2 miles from the launchpad as the capsule successfully landed back on the ground. Crew members return to Earth After a brief safety check, the hatch was opened and each of the astronauts were allowed to exit the capsule one by one. S\u00e1nchez was the first to walk through the doors, hugging fianc\u00e9 Bezos. Perry was the next to exit, pointing at the sky with a smile on her face before kissing the ground. Nguyen then popped out, pumped her fists and cheered with the crowd on the ground. Bowe followed closely behind, also raising her arms. King then walked down the stairs. \"I just have to have a moment with the ground...to appreciate the ground for just a second,\" said King as she got on her knees and kissed the ground before commenting \"that was amazing.\" Flynn was the final crew member to exit, chanting, \"I went to space!\" \"I'm so proud of you,\" Bezos said as he gave Flynn a hug. Gayle King describes space journey Gayle King speaks after her return from space on Monday, April 14, 2025. Blue Origin / CBS Mornings Jumping up and down after the journey to space, King said she wouldn't call it a \"ride\" but a \"bona fide freakin' flight.\" She said that she's proud of herself for overcoming her fear of flying. King described the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line as being \"oddly quiet\" and \"peaceful.\" \"You look down at the planet and you think, 'That's where we came from?' To me, it's such a reminder about how we need to do better - be better,\" said King, adding that she'll \"never, ever, ever forget it.\" Though they all trained for it, King said microgravity was \"very difficult,\" particularly when you had to get back into your seat and strap in to make the trip back down. \"I looked like a freakin' moose getting in the chair,\" King joked. \"It was like, 'Just let me get in the chair! Let me get the seatbelt on!'\" But Perry quickly soothed her panic by singing \"What A Wonderful World.\" \"Isn't that nice?\" said King, calling it really special. Blue Origin's all-women crew talks about launch \"Profound,\" an emotional S\u00e1nchez said is the one word she would use to describe the spaceflight, describing the contrast of the darkness and the bright moon and then looking back at Earth. \"You look back at Earth and it's this beautiful jewel. It was quiet. It felt like it was breathing. It was so alive,\" she said during a news conference the crew held about three hours after the launch. A video showed the six crew members floating inside the capsule, gathering together and saying, \"Take up space!\" They each moved to their large windows and took in the breathtaking scene while holding up personal items they brought with them. Perry held up a daisy, a tribute to her 4-year-old daughter Daisy. \"Flowers, for me, I believe are like God's laughter and God's smile. I brought a daisy because I have so much love for my daughter Daisy, and I have so much love for Mother Earth and I believe you can see the beauty in the Mother Earth in a single, resilient daisy,\" Perry explained. King said she was proud of the entire crew for their bravery, admitting the walk to the capsule was \"a little daunting.\" \"We were all feeling this experience together. I know I will never forget it,\" King said, adding that she walked out of the capsule feeling like she can do anything after conquering her fear of flying. Flynn said she thinks she blacked out during most of the ride but she felt \"a sense of peace\" at the height of the ride. \"I almost felt as if I was watching a really intimate film,\" said Flynn, acknowledging that the trip went so fast. \"What a beautiful world we have,\" agreed Nguyen, who discussed conducting experiments aboard the flight. \"If I got there, you can get there, too,\" she added. Bowe held up the Bahamian flag while on the capsule as a \"powerful reminder of the past, the present and the future of space,\" giving a nod to her grandfather who was in the crowd at the news conference. Oprah's message to Gayle King before spaceflight A sea of yellow filled the viewing area at Blue Origin's launch site Monday as Oprah Winfrey joined Gayle King's family and friends in color-coordinated outfits to support the \"CBS Mornings\" host's journey to space. \"All of us, the whole family is wearing yellow today,\" Winfrey said moments before her best friend blasted off as part of the historic all-women crew. \"I have never been more proud of my friend than today.\" Winfrey's bright attire matched the sunshine of the West Texas morning and symbolized a light of encouragement for King, who has long struggled with a fear of flying. \"This is bigger than just going to space,\" said Winfrey, stressing that King has \"real, real, real anxiety flying\" and jumps at even the slightest bit of turbulence. \"This is overcoming a wall of fear, a barrier. I think it's going to be cathartic in so many ways for her.\" Winfrey, who has been friends with King for nearly five decades, said she was among those who encouraged the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host to accept the spaceflight invitation. \"I think life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest expression of yourself,\" Winfrey said. \"I know that, I felt deeply that she would regret it, and I didn't want to hear about it for the next 15 years.\" Her final words to King before the flight were: \"Peace. Be still. Hold to God's unchanging hand. He's got your back.\" History of Blue Origin's New Shepard flights Blue Origin named its New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard , the first American to fly in space, who piloted Mercury's Freedom 7 capsule in May 1961 on its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates. \"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters after the successful 2021 spaceflight. The unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft. Blue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research. \"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added. How long was Gayle King and the crew in space? The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight. They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday. \"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin describes on its website . About Blue Origin's first all-women crew Crew of Blue Origin's NS-31 mission, clockwise from left: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, Amanda Nguyen, Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe and Kerrianne Flynn. Blue Origin Gayle King: \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, explained that participating in a spaceflight represents an unexpected turn in her life and career. \"I can't even believe what I saw,\" she said post-launch. Katy Perry: Pop superstar Katy Perry performed a tribute to Earth during her journey as part of the historic all-women space crew mission. \"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said ahead of the spaceflight. Lauren S\u00e1nchez: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, who is engaged to Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, helped assemble the all-women crew. She has many titles: Journalist, philanthropist and helicopter pilot, to name a few. She said the groundbreaking idea came to her immediately after Bezos returned from his journey beyond Earth's atmosphere. \"Within 24 hours, he's like, 'Would you ever go up?' I was like, 'What?' I was like, 'Yes, I would go up.'\" \"In that exact moment, I said, 'Could I take all women up?'\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"And he goes, 'That's a great idea.'\" Aisha Bowe: Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and two-time tech company founder, made history as the first person of Bahamian heritage to travel to space. She said she had \"been preparing for this moment my entire life.\" Amanda Nguyen: Civil rights activist and astronaut Amanda Nguyen, who drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights and played a key role in the act's 2016 passage, made history as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space. Nguyen told \"CBS Mornings\" about her plans to conduct two science experiments during Monday's spaceflight \u2014 one focused on plant pathology in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and the second on women's health, specifically menstruation. Kerianne Flynn: For American film producer Kerianne Flynn, gazing at the stars as a child in Michigan has evolved from wonder to reality, telling \"CBS Mornings\": \"I went through my life, my career and never really thought that going up there to be among those stars was a possibility. And now it's a reality.\" Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board. The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight. At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad. About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space. The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth. After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home. \"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News. Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace. Blue Origin's New Shepard crew capsule descends with its parachute system after a flight on Dec. 11, 2021. Mario Tama / Getty Images The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule. \"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\" The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.

Westend61/Getty Images/Westend61 2025-04-14T11:40:20Z Share Facebook Email X LinkedIn Copy link Save Saved Read in app This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Ad giant WPP offers free Friday lunches as a perk for staff as some express discontent at its RTO policy. The policy requires employees to work in-office four days per week, including two Fridays per month. WPP said the free lunches are not connected to an employee petition protesting the RTO policy. Advertising giant WPP hopes to sweeten the deal on in-office work by promising free lunch on Fridays as it fights employee discontent over its RTO policy. A WPP spokesperson told Business Insider complimentary lunches on Fridays were introduced at the company's UK-based campuses this month. On Saturday, The Times reported that the free lunch at WPP's South Bank office in London offered beef rag\u00f9, garlic bread, and a spring salad. The spokesperson told BI it was one of several perks being offered to help foster an appealing work environment for employees coming into the office. They did not confirm whether the free lunches would be permanent. The initiative comes soon after over 20,000 people signed a petition expressing unhappiness at WPP's recent RTO mandate. WPP's new rules have been controversial among employees, who were told by chief executive Mark Read that they now have to come into the office four times a week and commit to coming in two Fridays a month. The memo, obtained by BI in January , was sent to 114,000 employees. Read said that in-office attendance was associated with \"stronger employee engagement, improved client survey scores, and better financial performance.\" \"I believe that we do our best work when we are together in person,\" he wrote. \"It's easier to learn from each other, it's a better way to mentor colleagues starting out in the industry, and it helps us win pitches as a truly integrated team.\" The petition, in contrast, described the policy as a \"step backwards in supporting employee wellbeing and work-life balance.\" \"The mental and social effects on employees due to such rigid work regimes can be extensive,\" it said. \"Therefore, we call on Mark Read and the decision-making body at WPP to reconsider this mandate and adopt a policy that respects and prioritises the well-being and preferences of its employees.\" Some staffers' complaints added in comments include the additional hours of traveling per day and the added expenses of commuting to and from the office. WPP's spokesperson told BI the free lunch initiative was planned independently of the petition. Employees have had mixed responses to RTO policies. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told all corporate employees they had to be in the office five days a week . Goldman Sachs, Salesforce, and JPMorgan have followed suit . While critics say the strict policies can erode trust and cause friction between management and staff , others have a more positive view. Gen Z, for example, may strongly benefit from being physically in the office, workplace experts previously told BI. Benefits can include enhanced teamwork and more chances for mentoring and career development, Anita Williams Woolley, a professor of organizational behavior at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, said. However, according to one 2024 survey, around three-quarters of Gen Z and about 50% of other generations said that hybrid working is their ideal setup . Experts have previously told BI more autonomy and flexibility can help to abate burnout and foster a better work-life balance .

Having a power station at home can help keep your appliances running in a power cut, and a good portable one can upgrade your camping trips.

See at Wellbots Anker makes some of favorite power stations , with its Solix F3800 being our pick for those looking for an extra large option or something to use as a home backup.

It was designed to be 80% charged in 1.5 hours and has multiple inputs for your gadgets: two USB-A slots, three USB-C slots, one for AC and a car charging port. It weighs 132 pounds, so it can be intimidating to move this thing around, but it has sturdy wheels that make it easier to maneuver.

Katy Perry promised to sing on the trip and did so, but it was difficult to hear. Here's what to know about the flight and crew of the New Shepard 31. Lauren S\u00e1nchez , Katy Perry, and a crew of inspirational women took a trip to space on Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket on Monday. The women were on Blue Origin's NS-31 , the 31st flight of the New Shepard rocket program, which launched from its base in Texas. Here's what to know about the flight and the crew. Blue Origin's NS-31 rocket launched at 8:30 a.m. CT. The six-person crew includes TV presenter Gayle King. Blue Origin The rocket traveled to space at up to three times the speed of sound. About 2 minutes and 40 seconds after launch, the crew capsule separated from the rocket, allowing it to cruise 62 miles above Earth over the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line \u2014 the internationally recognized boundary separating Earth's atmosphere from space. Once they were past this line, the crew unbuckled to experience a few minutes of weightlessness before the capsule fell back to Earth. The capsule landed using parachutes roughly 11 minutes after takeoff. Lauren S\u00e1nchez handpicked the NS-31 crew Katy Perry, Gayle King, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, and Jeff Bezos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in March. Kevin Mazur/WireImage The NS-31 crew featured: S\u00e1nchez, an Emmy-winning journalist and finance of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ; pop star Perry; Gayle King , the award-winning CBS News anchor; Amanda Nguyen, a bioastronautics research scientist and civil rights activist; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist; and Kerianne Flynn, a film producer. Not only was Nguyen the first Vietnamese woman in space, but this was the first all-female space crew since 1963, when Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian engineer, crewed a solo flight. S\u00e1nchez told Elle magazine she chose the other crew members because they're all \"storytellers in their own right. They're going to go up to space and be able to spread what they felt in different ways.\" S\u00e1nchez asked Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, the creative directors of luxury brand Oscar de la Renta and co-founders of their own brand Monse, to make fashionable spacesuits for the crew, she told The New York Times. The NS-31 crew is certified \u2018ready to fly to space\u2019 by CrewMember 7 Sarah Knights. The launch window opens tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. CDT / 13:30 UTC. You can watch the live webcast here tomorrow at 7 a.m. CDT, hosted by Charissa Thompson, Kristin Fisher, and Ariane Cornell. pic.twitter.com/auKPJvtSl3 \u2014 Blue Origin (@blueorigin) April 14, 2025 Garcia and Kim partnered with Creative Character Engineering, a Hollywood costume company, to create the Monse Blue Origin suits. On Sunday, Perry posted an Instagram video showing the capsule, explaining that they dubbed their crew \"The Taking Up Space Crew\" and promising to sing during the flight. During the flight, she sang as she'd previously promised, but the audio was difficult to hear. King said on the Blue Origin livestream that Perry sang \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong. \"It's not about me. It's not about singing my songs,\" Perry said of her song choice. \"It's about a collective energy and making space for future women. It's about this wonderful world that we see right out there and appreciating it. This is all for the benefit of Earth.\" Meanwhile, Nguyen said on Instagram she would conduct multiple experiments on women's health and plants during the brief flight. Blue Origin flight deposits are $150,000 Jeff Bezos founded Amazon and Blue Origin. Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press Blue Origin , founded by Bezos, has been offering space tourism flights since 2021. The company does not disclose the cost of a space flight , but the website says applicants must pay a $150,000 refundable deposit. In 2021, Blue Origin auctioned a seat for its maiden flight for $28 million. Tim Chrisman, the cofounder of the Foundation for the Future, told the Observer in 2022 that a board member of the nonprofit paid $1 million for his seat. Blue Origin has also attracted several celebrities, including William Shatner, the \"Star Trek\" star.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. By Gizmodo Deals Published April 14, 2025 | \ud835\udd4f Copied! \u00a9 Amazon Americans are rushing to purchase Apple products in bulk in anticipation of the soon-to-be-imposed tariff hikes that will substantially raise prices within a few weeks. Based on early rumors, prices for electronic devices are likely to double or triple so now is the best time to buy your desired Apple products at their current (and reasonable) prices. The most popular deal on Amazon is about the newest AirPods 4, which are selling for just $119 now down from their $129 list price . The discount isn\u2019t huge but it\u2019s a great opportunity to pick up Apple\u2019s latest wireless earbuds before potential price increases. See at Amazon The Best Audio Experience The AirPods 4 are a major leap forward in Apple\u2019s iconic earbud lineup as they combine advance tech with a comfortable design. Powered by Apple\u2019s advanced H2 chip, they deliver exceptional audio performance and a host of intelligent features that adapt super easily to your environment (whether you\u2019re commuting through noisy city streets or enjoying a quiet evening at home, it will adapt to any situations). These earbuds are very popular because of the Personalized Spatial Audio experience with dynamic head tracking. This technology creates a \u201ctheater-like\u201d sound experience by placing audio all around you, which makes music, movies and games feel a lot more immersive and three-dimensional. Complementing this is Adaptive EQ which automatically adjusts low and midrange frequencies based on what you\u2019re hearing. Active Noise Cancellation first comes to the AirPods 4 open-ear option courtesy of enhanced microphones and the H2 chip. ANC eliminates low-frequency background noise\u2014such as airplane propellers or heating and air systems\u2014before it reaches your ears so that you can enjoy your tunes or podcasts uninterrupted. For times when you want to be aware of your environment, Transparency Mode allows you to hear what\u2019s going on around you without having to take out your earbuds. Comfort has also been a number one concern in the AirPods 4 design (which is not really the case of the AirPods Pro 2): The silhouette and fresh inner design provide a comfortable and secure fit for even more individuals. The smaller stem houses the H2 chip and features a force sensor for easy playback and telephone control with the mere pinch of your fingers. What you\u2019ll also like about these AirPods is that they offer up to 6 hours of listening time on a single charge with ANC enabled and up to 30 hours total when using the USB-C charging case . A quick five-minute charge provides about an hour of playback so you\u2019re never without your favorite tunes for long. At $119 at Amazon, they are a great value but also a wise investment as tariffs may jack up prices in the future. Make sure you get yours asap.

I bought that for a similar price last week. It usually comes down to around $200 on amazon. DAnn0 on 14/04/2025 - 21:51 +2 @magnitude: Good on pointing this out, honestly this would be very easy to miss to the untrained eye seanbaussie on 14/04/2025 - 21:47 +3 Note: \u2460 Since the tablet has a simple protective film attached to the tablet, please do not pull it too hard when removing the film. \u2461 The headphone jack is not 3.5mm and is also used as a Type-C (USB 2.0, data transmission/charging/headphones) interface. \u2462 To reduce electronic waste, this product does not include a charger and is compatible with most standard chargers you already own. Tock on 15/04/2025 - 09:38 Mine included a charger and cable (not AU) - was from AliExpress so maybe different packaging. And yes, comes with a screen protector already on which is super handy. netbies on 14/04/2025 - 21:58 The screen resolution 1920x1200 is weird for some application such as youtube short videos, they got extended and cropped off from top and bottom. dosada on 14/04/2025 - 22:03 +2 Comes With 16GB RAM (6GB LPDDR4X + 10GB virtual expansion dausyidsadasddwka on 14/04/2025 - 22:45 +1 Is this tablet good enough for reading on the couch and watching shows on the treadmill or should I hold out for a deal on something like a Xiaoxin Pad Pro? Budget around ~200-400 AeymothSky on 15/04/2025 - 04:37 +1 Yea it is Tock on 15/04/2025 - 09:40 +1 Yes, easy. I got one from Ali a few weeks ago. It is now my Home Assistant panel on the fridge plus kids YouTube and random couch surfing. So far, impressed with display, speed and build quality for price. dausyidsadasddwka on 15/04/2025 - 11:51 +1 Thanks for the review. I'm not planning on doing any gaming on this so I'll just pick this tablet up then, still got a bunch of 10% off gift card credit from the last Amazon deal. Nalar on 15/04/2025 - 15:36 +1 the 50pro was plenty enough for YT, comics, slay the spire and browsing, so this should be fine.

Glue-on foam ceiling tiles providing a quick, fancy refresh to your kitchen or living room. Gotta love an easy way to add a \"wow\" factor without having to splurge on carpentry or remodeling. Amazon, www.amazon.com Reviewers recommend a strong glue like this one . Promising review: \"If you\u2019re even considering doing it, JUST DO IT!! I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how easy this was, and the end result is mind-blowing! When people come over (we\u2019re remodeling our newly purchased home built in 1865), their jaws drop. We put this in the sunroom/eat-in kitchen area. We love it so much we\u2019ll be doing it in the bar area of the dining room. When you actually get them on the ceiling and look at your finished product, you\u2019d never guess it\u2019s styrofoam. Caulking between the tiles was crucial to giving its overall look. That was the most difficult part. My advice (from watching hours of YouTube videos and doing research): Find the center of the ceiling and work your way out. It took us two hours to do a fairly large space. We definitely overestimated how many it would take, but I\u2019m glad we had extra on hand in case we messed one up. Also \u2014 make sure your blade is SHARP!\" \u2014 Steven Get it from Amazon for $31.92+ (available in packs of 8, 48, 96, 144, and in eight colors). 2. An 18k gold-plated cherry keychain because dropping almost $100 on the one from Coach is honestly kind of ridiculous. Reviewers say this one is almost identical! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \" When I initially bought it, I was nervous that the brass color wasn\u2019t going to match with my coach bag, but once it arrived, it was perfect; it looks almost like the real one and doesn\u2019t feel cheap at all, I\u2019m very happy with my purchase, and I'd 100% recommend this to someone looking for an alternative to the Coach cherry charm!\" \u2014 Veronica G. Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 3. Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick offering super long-lasting staying power (up to 16 hours!!!), so you can enjoy a luxuriously vibrant pout all day, even after eating and drinking. Reviewers say this is not only comparable to, but BETTER than brands like MAC, Chanel, and Anastasia Beverly Hills. Amazon, www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Easy to use, pretty long wearing, very smooth, and comfortable. More of a slight satin finish, not too matte and not too shiny. The product does not flake and lasts all day into night without a touch-up, as long as you don't have an extremely oily meal. I actually now reach for this over my Chanel lip ink. Highly recommended.\" \u2014 Andy D Get it from Amazon for $7.98+ (available in 43 shades and in a kit option). Read our full review of the Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick . 4. A retro mushroom table lamp previously only seen in your wildest Architectural Digest dreams. Guests will ask you if you scored it at an auction; we'll let you decide how honest you wanna be (JK). www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I was so excited to turn this lamp on that I placed it on my couch instead of making room on my shelves. The lightweight lamp is funky, and the fun pop of orange adds character to my living room. It\u2019s always a cozy night in with this lamp. A great find to start your lamp collection or add to your existing one.\" \u2014 dana Get it from Amazon for $45.95 (available in four colors). 5. A midi corset dress if you love the House of CB Carmen dress but not the price. ($225?!) You can still enjoy a cinched back, front tie, and all the compliments of the real deal. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Check it out on TikTok . Promising reviews: \"Bought this dress because I always wanted to get the House of CB dress but didn\u2019t want to pay over $250 for it. It\u2019s honestly so good! I got the size large in this since they didn\u2019t have my normal sizes, which are small to medium (I have a bigger chest, so I tend to size up). But since this has a corset back, I was able to cinch it up really tight, and it fit perfectly!\" \u2014 Chris Herfurth Kennedy \"Beautiful, stunning perfection. This may be the best thing I've ever bought on Amazon. The corset in the back makes it fit like it was made for me. It's double-lined and not see-through at all, even though it's white. The straps are adjustable, the slit is a good height, and the fabric is slightly stretchy. I cannot say enough good things about it. It did come slightly wrinkly in the skirt, but nothing that a good steam won't fix.\" \u2014 Shoshanna Get it from Amazon for $53.99 (available in women's sizes 0\u201314 and 16 colors/styles). 6. A faux-sheepskin area rug ensuring the first thing your feet feel in the morning is fuzzy heaven. You can use this next to your bed, flung over a couch, or as an auxiliary pet bed. Yes, even Chanel the dog gets a fancy resting spot. Amazon Promising review: \"My parents went to Europe and sat outside on furs like these, and now they do the same at home. They live in the mountains in Utah. They put these on their metal patio chairs and then cover themselves with a blanket outside in the winter. The faux furs keep your backside insulated, and then, topped with the blanket, they are able to have a cocktail hour(s) on the deck all year long! It\u2019s honestly pretty sweet, and the dog gets her own to lie on when she\u2019s outside, too.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $15.19+ (available in six sizes and 11 colors). 7. A cute set of glass coffee syrup dispensers so you can pretend you have a personal coffee shop right inside your home. If the Seattle Space Needle can have its own Starbucks, why can't you? The kit comes with a funnel and package of labels, but if your coffee tastes are kind of niche, there are also two blank labels. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love the look of these dispensers on my kitchen counter. These dispensers have an expensive feel and look . Added so much class to my countertop, and blended perfectly with the current decor and items on the counter. The only change I would make is maybe adding an outline for where the perfect placement of the label should be on the jar. You really want them to be even and at the same height, but once they are on, they are on. I would still recommend this purchase to anyone! 10 out of 10. Gorgeous! These are stunning, and I am in love .\" \u2014 Kevin Get it from Amazon for $25.95+ (available in three finishes and two sizes). 8. A spandex-blend slip maxi dress that's the closest you can get to wearing a nightgown outside while still looking ready for date night. Reviewers say that this fabric is not only comparable to a certain Skims dress, it might actually be even better. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Reviewers agree that if you want it fitted, size down. Promising reviews: \"I saw this girl wearing this exact style of dress with a Skims tag on the back, and honestly, it made me so grateful that I purchased this dress instead. It looks exactly like the Skims version, and I could be biased, but the material of this dress looked better than the Skims one. If you want it to be a little snug, I would definitely recommend sizing down one size from your normal size. So freaking comfortable and made out of thick material.\" \u2014 Kaitlyn \"I have the Skims dress in black and wanted to look for a cheaper version, but I read reviews, and some said that it is a bit looser than expected. I would agree that the small is a bit loose. If you want a snatched look, definitely get a size smaller, as it is very stretchy . I'm 5' tall so this is a bit long on me, even when I wear heels. In comparison to the Skims, the material is smoother, while Skims has a ribbed texture. You honestly can't tell the difference. Good bang for your buck if you ask me! \" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in women's sizes XXS\u2013XL and 10 colors). 9. And a scoop neck tee offering the same buttery softness as the beloved Skims top. Bonus: This one comes in more colors than it costs. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"At first, I was a little skeptical \u2014 I have been wanting to find a Skims-like material shirt for a while but didn't want to pay the price of one, lol, and this shirt feels amazing. I will be getting one in every color now.\" \u2014 Julianne Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in women's sizes XXS\u20133XL and 34 colors). 10. A cut crystal\u2013style cocktail shaker if you'd like to pretend you have a well-stocked home bar instead of a bar cart with quarter-filled bottles of Aperol and margarita mix. The 17-ounce shaker is made with crystal and stainless steel, and reviewers say it's leakproof. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I am so thrilled with this shaker. It's beautiful and can sit out on my bar cart; it is super functional and doesn't leak. It's a conversation starter, and everyone who has seen it loves the way it looks and asks where I got it. I will say, the bottom is quite heavy, and this makes shaking a bit awkward, but once you get used to it, it's no big deal.\" \u2014 Amanda B Get it from Amazon for $22.63 (available in three colors). 11. A set of massively popular moisture-wicking double-brushed microfiber sheets so soft and cuddly, guests will feel like they're staying at a 5-star hotel. They'll forget aaaalll about thread count when they slide into these sheets. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com LuxClub is a small business that specializes in soft, durable, luxury-style sheets. P romising review : \u201cLOVE THESE!! I was searching for a sheet set that would help me sleep more comfortably at night and found these. I have terrible hot flashes with night sweats and get up in the morning, just miserable. Of course, these do not eliminate my hot flashes as no sheets will, but they definitely make my nights much more comfortable by eliminating wet bedding, and I definitely appreciate that! Aside from their moisture-wicking abilities, they are very soft, easy to look at, and launder extremely well. I would highly recommend these for anyone shopping for sheet sets and especially for anyone experiencing night sweats!! \u201d \u2014 Shannon Warfel Get it from Amazon for $29.71+ (available in sizes Twin\u2013California King, with deep pockets, and in 40 styles). 12. Easy-to-install pull-out pantry drawers that'll make it way easier to dig around for the right snack or roll of tin foil. It seems like something like this would require a contractor and an expensive kitchen remodel, but nope! A single Ulysses S. Grant and change will do. Wayfair Promising review: \"Great product. Fit exactly. Clear instructions, easy to assemble, and install. High-quality components (solid wood sides, real plywood bottom, no particle board). Would buy again!\" \u2014 Russell Get one from Wayfair for $52.99+ (available in eight sizes). 13. A layered necklace set with three classic chains \u2014 herringbone, curb, and rope \u2014 that'll elevate any outfit, even your dog-walking uniform. Thanks to their gold plating, the necklaces are hypoallergenic and tarnish-resistant, making them a great budget option when solid gold is out of the question. Amazon Promising review: \"I love the way these layering necklaces look! I haven\u2019t taken them off since I received them and they look brand new still. I\u2019ve worn them in the shower, pools, and beach, and they are still perfect. \" \u2014 Allison Kwong Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in three finishes and 14 other styles). 14. Or a classic bubbly paperclip chain that's doing its best impression of a Tiffany HardWear necklace. The 14k gold-plated piece is so convincing, your friends might start expecting you to pick up the check at dinner. Amazon Promising review: \"I\u2019ve been thinking about purchasing the Tiffany version of this necklace, but when I saw this one, I decided to purchase it. So glad I did. It is beautiful and very substantial. When I first put it on, couldn\u2019t believe the weight, in a good way. Feels and looks expensive, and the color of the gold is perfect, in my opinion; not too yellow or orangey. Love, love, love this necklace!!!\" \u2014 FAXA10 Get it from Amazon for $20.99 (available in two finishes and also Cuban link styles). 15. No drill, wall-mounted amber bottles for anyone who wants the hotel treatment at home. At first glance, the waterproof labels conjure up an Aesop vibe, so guests are gonna be like, \"OK, fancy.\" www.amazon.com The kit comes with a silicone funnel so you can easily transfer your favorite toiletries. You can see how one TikTok user styled these in this TikTok . Promising review : \"We have a narrow bathtub/shower with little space. I love this product; it\u2019s so easy to install. I used a level to keep them aligned . Wait 24 hours before you use them. Great price, great quality, I highly recommend.\" \u2014 Karen Kopecki Get it from Amazon for $24.70+ (available in six different styles and quantities of one, two, or three). 16. A roll of peel-and-stick fake marble to jazz up all your dull surfaces. The adhesive is water-resistant and heat-resistant up to 158 degrees Fahrenheit. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Used a little more than one roll for a quick makeover for an ugly fireplace in a rental apartment. It was easy to cover the tiles with the film, and I could stretch the film out about 1 mm if I had cut the strip too short. It makes a huge difference for minimal effort/price. I don't think anyone would be squinting down at the floor to notice the slightly pixelated pattern.\" \u2014 zhen Get a single roll from Amazon for $10.05+ (available in six sizes and six designs). 17. A super-soft longline sports bra some have compared to Lululemon's Align tank top for an Equinox-level workout look at a Planet Fitness price. Reviewers say it offers a little less compression, so you can wear it on casual days, too. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I wasn't seeing many pictures of small-chested ladies, so I was a little worried about how this would fit. Purchased X-Small, and it fits perfectly! The straps stay in place, don't look weird with the bra cups, and it is form-fitting in the back. I hate tank tops that have a big gap in the back. This one does not. It goes down to about my belly button. I wanted something similar to the Lululemon Align, but this is well worth it instead! It is not tight at all, does not dig in, and is super breathable. I am thrilled with this purchase!\" \u2014 olivia schilling Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes XS\u20133XL and 29 colors). 18. And high-waisted leggings that have also been compared to Lululemon A LOT, like over-600-reviewers lot. They're buttery soft, pass the squat test, and have the perfect stretch-to-hug ratio. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"They are the best leggings I've ever owned! I've been weight training for roughly 17 years now, and I've worn a lot of different leggings. I've even spent $180 on a pair of Lululemon leggings, which don't compare to these at all. These leggings are soft, stretchy, form-fitting, and they make you look incredible! This is the fourth pair I've bought, and I probably will buy all colors. Also very important: They don't leave sweat marks. 100% squat-proof and the softest material ever. I can't say it enough!\" \u2014 Emily Souther Get them from Amazon for $25 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XL and 23 colors). 19. A baroque-inspired mirror for anyone who has been eyeing the gorgeous Anthropologie mirrors but can't quite rationalize the hefty price tag. This piece of decor is pretty similar and comes at a fraction of the cost. www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I hopped on the gold ornate mirror trend and spent a long time trying to find one within my budget. I was worried at first because there weren\u2019t any reviews when I first bought this. It looked amazing online and was the perfect size, so I went ahead and got it. I am THRILLED with this purchase!!! One of the best things I\u2019ve gotten from Amazon. It\u2019s beautiful and exactly how it looks in the pics. It came four-ish days faster than estimated. It\u2019s perfect for my makeup desk. If there were different sizes of the same mirror, I would buy all of them.\" \u2014 McKinlee Mayer Get it from Amazon for $89.99+ (available in 10 sizes and five finishes). 20. Dossier's \"Ambery Vanilla\" perfume that'll smell familiar to any fans of YSL's spendy Black Opium scent. If you're not in the know, it has a dedicated following thanks to its unique blend of mandarin, vanilla, pink pepper, jasmine, and cedarwood. Just like its pricier cousin, this fragrance has staying power, so expect some \"you smell fancy\" comments throughout the day. www.amazon.com Dossier is a small business that specializes in alternative, affordable perfumes \u2014 check out the rest of their options on their Amazon storefront ! Promising review: \"Gorgeous scent! I love perfumes, and I\u2019m super picky. I either love or return. This scent is gorgeous. Smells a bit sweet but not overly sweet, not super vanilla, just a hint of it with sophistication. Very soft and sultry. I applied moisturizer (thin, thin layer of Vaseline) and then sprayed perfume. It stayed on my skin for probably over eight hours. I checked my sweater the next day you could easily smell it on my sweater. Definitely worth the money.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29+ (available in two sizes). 21. A beautiful tennis bracelet no one has to know is actually made with zirconia. You just need to decide if you want yellow, white, or rose gold plating \u2014 or OK, all three. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com If you want to step up the quality, the bracelet is also available in 18k gold vermeil. Learn more about the difference here . Promising review: \"I LOVE this bracelet!!! It looks so expensive and is heavy-duty. If you want a tennis bracelet without spending thousands of dollars, I HIGHLY recommend this!\" \u2014 Gabby Little Get it from Amazon for $17.95+ (available in three lengths and three finishes, as well as in a set of two). 22. A *solid wood* modern dining room chair that looks like the Wishbone Chairs from Carl Hansen & Son, but for about a tenth of the price. They even come fully assembled, so you can pretend like you don't normally have to contribute to the creation of your furniture. Bed Bath & Beyond Promising review: \"Really impressed with the quality of these chairs, and as a bonus, they came fully assembled. I was prepared to spend triple on similar chairs through another retailer and I am really pleased with these. Delivery was super quick, and chairs are gorgeous.\" \u2014 Kim L. Get it from Bed Bath & Beyond for $182.44 . 23. A classic pleated tennis skort with...*drumroll*...pockets! Pleased reviewers have compared it to reputable brands like Nike, Aritzia, and even Lululemon, saying it's suuuper comfortable. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising reviews: \"I LOVE this skirt! I have the original Nike one and they are identical. The only difference is that it doesn\u2019t have a logo on it, but tbh, I prefer the no-logo look. It\u2019s such a good buy and SO comfortable!\" \u2014 Tayler \"I was skeptical at first, but once it arrived! WOW! I love this skirt! I need one in every color now. Very comfortable, breathable fabric and the skirts have secret pockets on the inside of the shorts! I really like it, and the length is perfect! Oh, and there\u2019s a super cool thick band around the skirt top. It looks very nice I received a lot of compliments on skirt! Definitely recommend! \u2764\ufe0f\" \u2014 VM Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in nine colors and XS\u2013XXL). 24. A pair of stylish teardrop earrings similar to the popular Bottega Veneta ones, but for a fraction of the price. They're lightweight and gold-plated, meaning that even those with sensitive ears can enjoy them. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! If I didn't know any better, I would have said these are the Bottega Drop Earrings. I personally love the smaller ones. I have not ordered the larger ones yet. Smaller ones are truthfully the perfect size. We love a good alternative because who has $800+ to spend on the Bottegas.\" \u2014 Brittany Get them from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 11 colors, two-packs, and an extra large size). 25. Square premade wall panels that'll jazz up your otherwise boring walls (no offense). The lightweight molding can be installed with removable mounting tape and give your home some understated elegance. www.amazon.com Some reviewers even installed them on doors and kitchen islands! Promising review: \"Moldings came in well-packed and quickly. It was super easy to install. Used White Lightning Speed Grip to adhere the panels. These panels gave a high-end look to an otherwise drab wall and peninsula. So classic and affordable, and it will never go out of style !\" \u2014 JM Get a single panel from Amazon for $12.15+ (available in 13 sizes). 26. A Howard Products Feed-N-Wax wood polish and conditioner to give your floors and furniture an impossibly lustrous shine previously never seen in your home. The carnauba wax and beeswax enhance and protect your wood from drying out, so your guests will probably wonder if you splurged on new floors. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Many reviewers started by using Restor-A-Finish to blend out minor scratches before finishing with the Feed-N-Wax. It's as simple as wiping on and off! Promising review: \"I got this product a few hours ago from Amazon and now have shiny floors! It gave the really dull hardwood floors of my prewar NYC apartment an impressive shine. Really impressive. A little goes a long way: I used only about two ounces to shine about 500 square feet of clean floors. Before using it on the floors, I tested the polish on an old wooden side table that was scarred and needed sanding. It looked a lot better afterward.\" \u2014 KindleCustomer2 Get it from Amazon for $11.45 . 27. A set of lovely silk tulips that look like the real deal but, unlike live flowers, can stick around for many springs to come. Keeping a regular rotation of fresh flowers can be pricey! Spritz 'em with a little perfume and guests won't even be able to tell they're imposters. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I've seen these all over TikTok and had them in my cart for months\u2026ended up buying them and THEY ARE WORTH THE MONEY. Soft, soft, soft and look so real, I\u2019m going to buy more.\" \u2014 Brittney Jackson Get a set of 20 from Amazon for $18.99 (available in 63 color combos). 28. A roll of peel-and-stick subway tile backsplash to hide your offensively boring kitchen or bathroom walls. The waterproof and heat-resistant tiles interlock and stick right onto surfaces \u2014 no expensive remodel needed. www.amazon.com Promising reviews : \"We just moved into a rental that only had painted walls where the backsplash should be. My landlord approved my request to put backsplash up, and I sprung for the subway tiles with black grout. No bubbles, easy to peel, very sticky. These are pretty thick and seem like good quality. All in all, I would highly recommend.\" \u2014 Pleasetryadifferentname \"I\u2019ve been wanting to try peel-and-stick tiles for a long time, and I\u2019m so glad I found these for our kitchen facelift! They are so easy to apply and look amazing! I love that they are actual-size subway tiles as well! They\u2019ve given our kitchen the last very important piece that it needed!\" \u2014 April Grill Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in 18 colors). 29. Synthetic extensions if you want to look like you spent top dollar at the salon. These clip-ins provide instantly perfect beachy waves with zero effort and minimal cash. With over 12,000 5-star reviews \u2014 and many citing easy installation, comfort, and ability to style with heat \u2014 I'm inclined to think these things are well worth the little you have to pay! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Okay, so I am very picky about hair extensions. I've spent hundreds of dollars on numerous sets and have never been completely satisfied. UNTIL NOW! These are BY FAR my favorite \u2014 and for such an amazing price! If you're worried that this deal is too good to be true (because I was), then stop worrying! And buy these extensions. Also, I have very short hair, and it still looks great! They're very full and luscious. And you can straighten them! I'm very happy!\" \u2014 Makenzie Long Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in six lengths and 32 colors). 30. Or curly extensions for those with 3c or 4a hair. Reviewers say the human hair clip-ins are surprisingly high quality for the price, and some have even successfully dyed them. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Each length options comes with a different number of bundles. Check the listing to see how many you'll get. Promising review: \"I really like these extensions. My hair shrinks A TON and these clip-ins help me retain the length that I believe is owed to me when the mist decides to come out and ruin my good hair day. I use two packs and space them between my hair, but if it\u2019s really cold and misty (I live in San Francisco), I\u2019ll braid my hair in the back and clip the extensions to the braids. The texture matches my hair perfectly and, with wear, tends to flop and bend all wild like my natural curls do. It looks very natural. I\u2019m very open about my hair, and if someone asks, I\u2019ll let them know that I use clip-ins, and often people are shocked because they truly can not tell . I highly recommend these.\" \u2014 Bryce Get them from Amazon for $42.99+ (available in seven lengths and six colors). 31. Stained glass window film you might be able to pass as the real thing \u2014 at least at first glance. It's also the coolest version of privacy film I've ever seen, so it's worth it even if you don't trick your neighbors. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com The window cling is adhesive free and easy to remove. Promising review: \"It's beautiful and installation was really easy. I love it. It is wonderful!!! The pattern changes color as the sun passes throughout the day. Really pretty.\" \u2014 Lily Fred Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in five sizes and 17 designs). 32. A charming bubble dot bar glass reminiscent of a certain Maison Balzac design. For a tenth of the price, you can still enjoy a whimsical bevvy. World Market Promising review: \"These glasses not only look great, but are easy and fun to hold because of the colorful bubbles. Love them and will likely get more of them.\" \u2014 anonymous Get it from World Market for $8.99 (available as a coupe or old fashioned). 33. A cult-favorite luxury-scented candle reviewers love for its intoxicating and long-lasting smell (think: Le Labo's Santal 33). It has an impressive throw, meaning you can actually fill your home with its calming jasmine, oud, and sandalwood scent instead of having to stick your nose right up to the flame. www.amazon.com If you're wondering what oud is, think of the smell of fallen trees in the woods after a hard rain. Lulu Candles is a US-based small business that specializes in scented candles and perfumes. Promising review : \"I was staying over at a friend's house and sitting next to her coffee table. She had this candle on the table and even though it wasn't lit I could smell it, and it was so delicious that I instantly went online to find it and bought it for myself! If this came in a perfume I would buy enough to last the rest of my life. I don't know how to even explain the scent but if you are an amber/patchouli/vanilla fan, this is absolutely for you. The jasmine adds an unbelievable freshness without a flowery scent . I even bought the shampoo and conditioner which I will probably use as more of a body wash and shaving cream but that is how desperate I am to get this scent on me! \" \u2014 Melissa I.

Because of all that, things aren't getting any cheaper. We've already heard news about some technology getting more expensive, and there aren't many discounted bits of gaming tech floating around as everyone collectively tightens their belts. But in spite of it all, one of the most coveted bits of gaming hardware is seeing a miraculous 10% discount. The Meta Quest 3S at full price is already one of, if not the, best budget VR headset ever made, but its $299.99 price tag has taken a cut at Amazon, dropping the 128GB model to $269 . The same is true of the 256GB SKU which is seeing the same $30 off. That brings it down to $369 (was $399.99) at Amazon . Since its launch in October last year, the Quest 3S has never dropped in price by this degree. It had a few tiny discounts over the Christmas Holiday, but it has never been cheaper than it is right now. I first spotted the Quest 3S's price take a tumble right before I clocked off on Friday evening, but it was only seeing a discount in the UK. Given all of the goings on in the world, I didn't expect that price cut to make its way over the Atlantic, but here we are, talking about the fact you can get one of the best VR headsets for cheaper right now. It's safe to say we're in a pretty unpredictable place economically at the moment, so don't expect this discount to last for long. Meta Quest 3S 128GB | $299.99 $269.99 at Amazon Save $30 - Perhaps the best part about this discount is that the Quest 3S is still rocking its launch bundle which gets you a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow along with your headset. Who knows how long that's going to last, let alone this price? Buy it if: \u2705 You want to try out VR gaming without a heavy investment \u2705 You want mixed-reality features \u2705 You only play VR games every now and again Don't buy it if: \u274c You play VR games all the time (get the Quest 3 instead) \u274c You own a PS5 already 256GB model: $369 at Amazon UK: 346 at Amazon View Deal Should you buy the Meta Quest 3S? (Image credit: Future / Duncan Robertson) It's difficult to find a reason not to recommend the Meta Quest 3S , in all honesty. This is a headset so strong that it actually calls into question who should spend the extra cash on a full-fat Meta Quest 3 . For most users, this is all the VR headset they'll need to enjoy fully immersive gaming and a few bits of spatial computing. If you aren't mainlining VR as your primary gaming platform, the Quest 3S gets you almost all of the same specs and features for much cheaper. There are two caveats to that. Firstly, if you ask me, the biggest win for the Quest 3 over the 3S is the pancake lenses. It's amazing how much of a difference they make, and if you can afford to put down the extra cash for them, I'd argue they're worth it. Again, that's really only going to be true if you play a lot of VR games, whether that's standalone or through a linked gaming PC . If you usually play with just the power of the headset, the Quest 3 and 3S both harness the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, so you're not going to notice a big difference in terms of power being kicked into your eyeballs. Speaking of that processor, I'd use it as an excuse to justify this purchase here and now. Qualcomm's outsourced manufacturing happens in Taiwan, elsewhere in Asia, and other territories, so I'd fully expect this to be a rare discount for 2025, should the USA's disruptive Tariffs continue into the year. The second caveat is that if you already own a PS5, I'd spend money on a PSVR 2 instead. Admittedly, you're not going to get the same standalone experience of spatial computing capabilities, but if you only plan to use a VR headset for gaming, be it on a PS5 or PC, Sony 's headset is going to give you a better time of it.

Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Amazon has an interesting deal going on with the Galaxy S25 Ultra right now. You can pick up the 512GB model for $1099, which is the exact same sale price as the 256GB model. So obviously, we are going to recommend getting the 512GB of storage instead since it\u2019s the same price. But this means that Amazon is shaving $320 off of the 512GB Galaxy S25 Ultra . That\u2019s one of the best deals we\u2019ve seen for the S25 Ultra that doesn\u2019t involve a trade-in. The Galaxy S25 Ultra isn\u2019t a huge upgrade over the previous year\u2019s phone, which is not a huge surprise. Smartphones are pretty mature now, and companies like Samsung know that you aren\u2019t upgrading every year. So each year, we\u2019re looking at minimal updates, so when you update after 3-4 years, it\u2019s actually a pretty big upgrade. However, this year, we are looking at a larger display, now 6.9 inches, thanks to the 15% thinner bezels, the phone is actually physically smaller. It does run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, which isn\u2019t just an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite, but fully customized for Galaxy. Additionally, there\u2019s 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage inside. The 512GB model is also available from Amazon, however, the 1TB model is only at Samsung . If you\u2019re still unsure whether you want to buy this phone or not, check out our Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review .

It can communicate with people and has a projector. Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images After years of demos - it was actually shown off over 5 years ago at CES 2020 - Samsung\u2019s bright yellow, BB8-esque, home robot is finally going on sale. The Korean company confirmed that Ballie will roll into homes in the US and Korea this summer, with a juicy AI upgrade courtesy of Google Gemini. Pre-registration is already live on Samsung\u2019s website , so it looks as if, finally, Samsung is serious about turning this longtime prototype into a product you can actually buy. I\u2019ve actually seen Ballie rolling around at various CES and IFA expos over the years and it\u2019s never really struck me as more than a glorified projector on wheels. However, thanks to a newly announced partnership between Samsung and Google, Ballie will be infused with Google Cloud\u2019s generative AI technology, Gemini. Combined with Samsung\u2019s own LLMs, Samsung informs us that Ballie will be able to \u201c bring personalized interactions and proactive home assistance to users.\u201d This means the ability to understand voice, visuals, and environmental data, so it can do more than just roll around and look cute and beam the 2nd season of The Last of Us on to your wall. It will, we\u2019re promised, be a mobile smart home assistant that can interact conversationally, offer things like styling advice, and helping you to create tailored environments in your home. \u201cThrough this partnership, Samsung and Google Cloud are redefining the role of AI in the home,\u201d said Yongjae Kim, Executive Vice President of the Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cBy pairing Gemini\u2019s powerful multimodal reasoning with Samsung\u2019s AI capabilities in Ballie, we\u2019re leveraging the power of open collaboration to unlock a new era of personalized AI companion - one that moves with users, anticipates their needs and interacts in more dynamic and meaningful ways than ever before.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 - Patch 8 Is Big, Beautiful And Sad On paper, it sounds like a blend between a smart display home hub, a life coach, a fashion consultant\u2026 and still a projector too, of course. Ballie includes a built-in projector, microphone, and speaker, so it can beam visuals onto nearby surfaces and respond to voice prompts, even when you\u2019re across the room. It will integrate with Samsung\u2019s SmartThings home platform, so things like controlling your lights, thermostat, or robot vacuum should all be on board. Samsung\u2019s been steadily working AI into its broader ecosystem, with the Galaxy S24 series already tapping into Gemini through Google Cloud. Samsung says this is all part of a \u201cnew era of personalized AI companion,\u201d which sounds ambitious, but also not totally out of sync with what other big tech players are exploring. LG showed off its own take on a roving home assistant earlier this year , while Apple, Meta, and Google are all reportedly tinkering with robotics behind closed doors as well. Amazon already has a bit of a robo-fail with Astro but is, of course, pimping AI for the smart home by way of the just-launched Alexa+. The launch timing may be locked in for the summer but we\u2019re still yet to learn the price which could, of course, make or break Ballie\u2019s success. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

According to the press release by the Japanese company, the new Sony PS5 prices will come into effect from April 14, Monday. Sony said that the prices of PS5 have been increased amid a \u2018challenging economic environment\u2019, without directly naming Donald Trump's tariffs. Swastika Das Sharma Updated 14 Apr 2025, 04:53 PM IST Sony PlayStation 5 prices will increase from today. ( AFP ) Sony on Sunday said it had made a \u2018tough decision\u2019 to increase prices of its superhit gaming product PlayStation 5 by up to 25 per cent as the industry reels from the effects of Donald Trump's tariffs. \u201cWith a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, SIE has made the tough decision to raise the recommended retail price (RRP) of the PlayStation 5 console,\u201d the Japanese major said in a press release. However, the price rise of PlayStation 5 is just made for the Digital Edition and not the console for some countries, Sony said. The PS5 Digital Edition is a slimmed-down version of the console that comes without a disc drive. PS5 price hike: Who will be affected? Sony said that the PlaySation price hike will be implemented in select markets as of now. This includes markets in Europe, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Select markets in Middle East and Africa will also be affected by the PS5 price hike. When will the new prices come into effect? According to the press release by the Japanese company, the new Sony PS5 prices will come into effect from April 14, Monday. New PlayStation 5 prices The prices of PlayStation have been hiked by up to 25 per cent by Sony. In Europe, the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition will now be sold for \u20ac499.99. In the UK, PS5 Digital Edition price has risen to \u00a3429.99. In both the markets, there has been no change for the prices of the standard PS5 with ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive. In Australia, the standard PS5 with ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive price has been hiked to AUD $829.95, while PS5 Digital Edition will cost AUD $749.95.

The Sony PS5 Digital Edition will on the other hand cost NZD $859.95. Sony did not notify about the exact price change in Middle East and Africa but advised buyers to check with local retailers. How much does Sony PS5 Digital Edition cost in India? The Sony PlayStation price increase does not affect India at the moment. In India, the PS5 Digital Edition retails for \u20b9 44,990, while the standard PlayStation 5 costs \u20b9 54,990. You can buy a Sony PS5 from online retailers including Amazon, Flipkart, Blinkit and the Sony Center. Also Read | Mint Primer: With electronics tariffs off, what happens to iPhone in India?

The lawsuit was filed against Meta - then called Facebook - in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. AP Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump's Federal Trade Commission's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta - then called Facebook - in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\" Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. \"Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company's executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\" the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram - then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following - in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Live Events Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" - a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. \"The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it's looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we're talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\" said Paul Swanson , an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \"And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\" Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\" \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \"must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg , who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg \"seems to be skeptical\" of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \"fact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram. \"Instagram is now Meta's biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company's ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg . \"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\" But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. \"A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it's an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing - these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\" Swanson said. \"And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\" (AP) Read More News on meta instagram ftc swanson paul swanson mark zuckerberg jasmine enberg james boasberg gen z Read More News on meta instagram ftc swanson paul swanson mark zuckerberg jasmine enberg james boasberg gen z Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition Asian Paints is trading at P/E lower than pandemic levels.

Reading books, talking about books, sharing book recommendations\u2026 it all lights me up inside. While I\u2019ve never kept track of all the books I\u2019ve read or done much other than fly through novels and share them with you guys on the blog (usually in a Things I\u2019m Loving Friday blog post), I try my best to pull recent reads together every so often on the blog so they\u2019re easier to find in one place. For today\u2019s blog post, we\u2019re focusing on the books I\u2019ve read since the beginning of 2025 but rather than just sharing a recap of the books, I figured I would rank them in order from the books I loved most to those I didn\u2019t find as enjoyable to read. Selfishly, I also enjoy sharing these type of blog posts here because I love it when YOU chime in and share some of your recent reads with me. I have you guys to thank for discovering some of the best books I\u2019ve read in my life, so please keep the book recommendations coming! Everything I\u2019ve Read So Far This Year: Ranked Joe Nuthin\u2019s Guide to Life by Helen Fisher Genre: Fiction / My rating: A One of you recommended Joe Nuthin\u2019s Guide to Life to me on Instagram after I mentioned how much I loved Eleanor Oliphant and Molly the Maid , two books with uniquely wonderful main characters. As expected, I absolutely adored Joe Nathan. He is a neurodivergent young man who loves the TV show Friends and is so wonderful in his innocence and his desire for routine, predictability and his determination to do the right thing. Joe Nuthin\u2019s Guide to Life is such a unique book and one I thoroughly enjoyed. It has depth, so many sweet moments and great takeaways. It is not a light read but it was also one my tender heart could still handle. I know this book will stick with me and it\u2019s the book currently claiming the top spot on my list of best books I\u2019ve read so far this year. From Amazon: Joe-Nathan likes the two parts of his name separate, just like dinner and dessert. Mean Charlie at work sometimes calls him Joe-Nuthin. But Joe is far from nothing. Joe is a good friend, good at his job, good at making things and at following rules, and he is learning how to do lots of things by himself. Joe\u2019s mother knows there are a million things he isn\u2019t yet prepared for. While she helps to guide him every day, she is also writing notebooks of advice for Joe, of all the things she hasn\u2019t yet told him about life and things he might forget. By following her advice, Joe\u2019s life is about to be more of a surprise than he expects. Because he\u2019s about to learn that remarkable things can happen when you leave your comfort zone, and that you can do even the hardest things with a little help from your friends. Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver Genre: Coming of age fiction / My rating: A Despite so many glowing recommendations, I put off reading Demon Copperhead when I read the synopsis of the book online because I knew it was going to be a heavy read. Yes, it was, but it was also an intensely moving and captivating coming-of-age story about a boy born to a teenage addict mother in rural Appalachia. The author\u2019s ability to write as Damon, or Demon as he is much more commonly known, felt so believable. She captured his wit, resilience, determination and intelligence but also his flaws, frustrations and struggles in such a human way. This book touched me and made me think deeply and I know it will be one that will stick with me. From Amazon: Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, Demon Copperhead is the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father\u2019s good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. Relayed in his own unsparing voice, Demon braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities. The Light Between Oceans by M.L. Stedman Genre: Historical fiction / My rating: A- My gosh this book just about wrecked me. I was so morally conflicted the entire time I read this book. And was so stressed out and heartbroken. It was the kind of book I could not stop reading because I just had to find out what happened in the end. An important warning: This book has a LOT of trigger warnings (miscarriage, stillbirth, loss, grief, child-related trauma \u2014 all the things) and it honestly is not a book I would\u2019ve read had I not gone into it blind based on the recommendation of a friend. I downloaded it from my Libby app, started reading and got hooked. Even though it was fairly clear from the beginning that this one was going to be a hard one to get through. This book is beautifully written. And would be an incredible discussion book for a book club if your heart can handle it. Just be prepared to be wrestling with yourself the entire time, especially if anything involving children breaks you. The Light Between Oceans follows Tom Sherbourne as he returns to Australia after four years serving on the Western Front. Tom accepts a job as lighthouse keeper on an isolated island called Janus Rock. And falls in love with a passionate, loving young woman named Isabel. The two marry and Isabel follows Tom to Janus Rock where they start a life together and pray for a baby. After multiple traumatic losses, they begin to wonder if a baby will ever happen for them when a boat washes ashore, carrying a dead man and a crying baby. Isabel is convinced the baby is the answer to their prayers. She begs Tom not to report the boat, the man and the baby. Tom is greatly conflicted but Isabel\u2019s love for the baby is immediate, deep and strong. And Tom finds himself falling for the child, too. After raising the baby as their own for two years, Tom and Isabel take her to the mainland to meet her grandparents and come face to face with the reality of their deception when they learn about a man and a baby who went missing years earlier, leaving behind a devastated wife and mother whose life has never been the same. The Light Between Oceans is a heart-wrenching tale of love and loss and impossible choices. Funny Story by Emily Henry Genre: Romance / My rating: B+ Whenever I finish reading an intense book I often like to follow it up with something a little fluffier and when Funny Story became available through my Libby app, the timing was perfect. I\u2019m not the die-hard Emily Henry fan I know many romance readers out there seem to be but I do enjoy her books and Funny Story was one of my favorites I\u2019ve read by this author. The book had depth, plausible character growth, steamy moments and likable characters. And I enjoyed it from start to finish. I also found myself thinking how this book would be such a great read for women in the early phases of dating, as I loved the way the main character in the book was on a bit of a journey of self discovery. And focused more on what she wanted as her own person rather than as part of a \u201cwe.\u201d The book follows Daphne, a young woman fresh out of a broken engagement her fiance called off when he realized he was in love with his childhood best friend, Petra. With no place to live and barely enough money to pay her bills, Daphne agrees to live with Miles, the ex-boyfriend of Petra, her now ex-fiance\u2019s new fiance. It\u2019s a mess of a situation made only messier when Daphne finds herself lying to her ex, saying she and Miles are now dating. Daphne and Miles begin a faux relationship that soon has Daphne questioning whether or not her feelings really are fake or if there might be something more to this random man she now calls her \u201cboyfriend\u201d and roommate. Swan Song by Elin Hilderbrand Genre: Domestic fiction/Mystery/Romance / My rating: B+ Elin Hilderband has long been a favorite author of mine to turn to when I\u2019m in the mood for a light, beachy read. She\u2019s the queen of weaving together characters from past novels in an interesting way and always incorporates beautiful Nantucket imagery into her novels. The reason I keep coming back to Elin\u2019s novels, however, is the element of mystery she includes in her books that often center around some kind of family/friend/Nantucket local drama. She has a whole cast of characters involved in her mysteries with multiple plotlines going at the same time so her books are never dull. Swan Song took a hot minute to grab my attention (it felt like almost too many characters in the beginning for me to latch onto) but once I was in on this book, I was all-in. I felt like I had a first-class ticket to some crazy island drama centering around ridiculously wealthy Nantucket newcomers, Leslee and Bull Richardson. From Amazon: Chief of Police Ed Kapenash is about to retire. Blond Sharon is going through a divorce. But when a 22-million-dollar summer home is purchased by the mysterious Richardsons\u2014how did they make their money, exactly?\u2014Ed, Sharon, and everyone in the community are swept up in high drama. The Richardsons throw lavish parties, flirt with multiple locals, flaunt their wealth with not one but two yachts, and raise impossible hopes of everyone they meet. When their house burns to the ground and their most essential employee goes missing, the entire island is up in arms. Listen for the Lie by Amy Tintera Genre: Mystery/Suspense / My rating: B+ I liked so much about this book, from the creative plot to the twists and turns that kept coming from beginning to end. However, my favorite thing about this book was the format that flip-flopped back and forth between narrator Lucy Chase, a woman accused of murdering her best friend Savvy years ago, and the transcript of a popular true crime podcast currently investigating Savvy\u2019s case. Reading the podcast transcript became such a captivating way to learn more about the next piece of bombshell information Lucy was about to listen to in real-time as the podcast aired. While I was able to guess most of the twists in this book, it was still an entertaining read and one I absolutely flew through, as it was a serious page turner. The tricky thing about Savvy\u2019s case is that Lucy, the prime suspect, remembers absolutely nothing from the night of her best friend\u2019s murder. She knows she attended a wedding with her husband and Savvy. But after that her memory seems to be wiped clean. Including the part where she\u2019s found walking along the side of the road covered in Savvy\u2019s blood hours after Savvy is killed. Lucy was never charged or convicted of murder and moved to Los Angeles to escape the small town scrutiny in Plumpton, Texas after that horrible evening. Fast forward several years and Lucy is back in Plumpton for her grandmother\u2019s birthday. But now Ben Owens, the host of the podcast currently investigating Savvy\u2019s murder is here, too. Will Ben solve Savvy\u2019s case? Will Lucy help him? Or is Lucy as guilty as everyone seems to think? The Paradise Problem by Christina Lauren Genre: Romance / My rating: B+ Christina Lauren novels are some of my favorites in the romance genre, though I\u2019ve come to realize some books by this author duo are much better than others. When they\u2019re good, their novels are breezy, steamy, funny and creative (like Soulmate Equation !) and when they\u2019re not, they fall flat in a big way (ahem, Something Wilder). Thankfully The Paradise Problem was exactly what I\u2019ve come to expect when I think of a good Christina Lauren novel! The plot of this book sucked me in immediately and I really looked forward to reading this tropical escape of a novel before bed every night. From Amazon: Anna Green thought she was marrying Liam \u201cWest\u201d Weston for access to subsidized family housing while at UCLA. She also thought she\u2019d signed divorce papers when the graduation caps were tossed, and they both went on their merry ways. Three years later, Anna is a starving artist living paycheck to paycheck while West is a Stanford professor. He may be one of four heirs to the Weston Foods conglomerate, but he has little interest in working for the heartless corporation his family built from the ground up. He is interested, however, in his one-hundred-million-dollar inheritance. There\u2019s just one catch. Due to an antiquated clause in his grandfather\u2019s will, Liam won\u2019t see a penny until he\u2019s been happily married for five years. Just when Liam thinks he\u2019s in the home stretch, pressure mounts from his family to see this mysterious spouse, and he has no choice but to turn to the one person he\u2019s afraid to introduce to his one-percenter parents\u2014his unpolished, not-so-ex-wife. But in the presence of his family, Liam\u2019s fears quickly shift from whether the feisty, foul-mouthed, paint-splattered Anna can play the part to whether the toxic world of wealth will corrupt someone as pure of heart as his surprisingly grounded and loyal wife. Liam will have to ask himself if the price tag on his flimsy cover story is worth losing true love that sprouted from a lie. How to End a Love Story by Yulin Kuang Genre: Romance / My rating: B There is so much I liked about this book: A peek into the screenwriting industry. (<\u2013 My favorite aspect of the book!) A vulnerable, raw and intriguing main character. Laugh-out-loud dialog. Beautiful and memorable writing. But there one main thing that held me back from absolutely loving this (steamy!) book: It was frustrating. I am all for will-they-won\u2019t-they plotlines between characters and while this one was very emotionally fraught and complex in a way I haven\u2019t read in other novels before, it felt very drawn out (especially in the second half of the book) and went on a little too long for me to enjoy. The book wasn\u2019t crazy long but it felt like the author really tried to squeeze every last morsel out of the main character\u2019s struggle to embrace love. I realize this is very likely realistic in the \u201creal world\u201d but it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the novel and the way I felt about the main character overall. From Amazon: Helen Zhang hasn\u2019t seen Grant Shepard once in the thirteen years since the tragic accident that bound their lives together forever. Now a bestselling author, Helen pours everything into her career. She\u2019s even scored a coveted spot in the writers\u2019 room of the TV adaptation of her popular young adult novels, and if she can hide her imposter syndrome and overcome her writer\u2019s block, surely the rest of her life will fall into place too. LA is the fresh start she needs. After all, no one knows her there. Except\u2026 Grant has done everything in his power to move on from the past, including building a life across the country. And while the panic attacks have never quite gone away, he\u2019s well liked around town as a screenwriter. He knows he shouldn\u2019t have taken the job on Helen\u2019s show, but it will open doors to developing his own projects that he just can\u2019t pass up. Grant\u2019s exactly as Helen remembers him\u2014charming, funny, popular, and lovable in ways that she\u2019s never been. And Helen\u2019s exactly as Grant remembers too\u2014brilliant, beautiful, closed off. But working together is messy, and electrifying, and Helen\u2019s parents, who have never forgiven Grant, have no idea he\u2019s in the picture at all. When secrets come to light, they must reckon with the fact that theirs was never meant to be any kind of love story. And yet\u2026 the key to making peace with their past\u2014and themselves\u2014might just lie in holding on to each other in the present. The Midnight Feast by Lucy Foley Genre: Mystery/Suspense / My rating: B Lucy Foley is a mastermind in the mystery/thriller space and after enjoying The Paris Apartment apartment so much, I was excited dive into The Midnight Feast next. This book was a disturbing and twisty but thoroughly entertaining. There were a handful of unexpected reveals which I appreciated (I always loved it when a book can surprise me!) but there were also a handful of predictable moments. The pace of the book is solid as it kept me invested from beginning to end and I think anyone who typically flies through a good mystery will fly through this one, too. From Amazon: It\u2019s the opening night of The Manor, the newest and hottest luxury resort, and no expense, small or large, has been spared. The infinity pool sparkles; the \u201cManor Mule\u201d cocktail is being poured with a heavy hand. Everyone is wearing linen. But under the burning midsummer sun, darkness stirs. Old friends and enemies circulate among the guests. Just outside the Manor\u2019s immaculately kept grounds, an ancient forest bristles with secrets. And it\u2019s not too long before the local police are called. Turns out the past has crashed the party, with deadly results. Do You Remember? by Freida McFadden Genre: Psychological thriller/Mystery / My rating: B I have mixed thoughts on Freida McFadden\u2019s books as a whole. Her novels always begin with such fervor and intrigue but the dialog between her characters often makes me roll my eyes and sometimes it feels like she spends too many pages rehashing the same issues/drama rather than adding depth to her stories. That being said, I\u2019ve come to realize her books are better as audiobooks for me personally. When I\u2019m listening, I\u2019m less picky about the quality of a story and more likely to appreciate a book as a source of entertainment while multitasking. That being said, I think this book would\u2019ve frustrated me had I read it but as an audiobook, it was entertaining enough and was one I looked forward to listening to on walks, while folding laundry, etc. The book begins when Tess wakes up to a life she does not recognize. Her last memories were of the night of her engagement to her beloved Harry, but the man she is now told is her husband, Graham, is certainly not him. Graham calmly explains to Tess that she was in an accident and suffered a brain injury that affected her memory. A note she wrote to herself encourages her to trust her husband, forget about Harry and do her best to accept and enjoy her day and her \u201cnew\u201d life. Despite obvious challenges, Tess does her best to do just this until so many things don\u2019t line up and so many new questions, and old memories, begin to arise. Can she trust her husband? Why did she end things with Harry? Is her \u201cnew\u201d life really as good as everyone around her assures her it is? One Perfect Couple by Ruth Ware Genre: Mystery/Suspense / My rating: B- Ruth Ware has a talent for writing books that immediately rope me in. The premise of One Perfect Couple is instantly captivating: Lyla, a scientist, and her actor boyfriend, Nico, are selected to be part of a reality TV show where couples compete against each other on a private and very remote island. Lyla only agrees to do the show to help Nico\u2019s career. And assumes she\u2019ll self-sabotage early on and return to her work. Only things do not go as planned. After the first couple\u2019s challenge, tempers flare and a storm hits the island, cutting everyone off from the real world\u2026 and possibly their chance at survival. Talk about a creative plot, right!? I was all-in on this book but my interest slowly began to temper off as the pages went on and on\u2026 and on. One Perfect Couple felt unnecessarily long. And didn\u2019t really have a lot of mystery components that left me wondering how things would turn out. There was really only one part of the book I didn\u2019t figure out on my own. But it all felt fairly predictable. And I missed the need to use my super-sleuth abilities to figure this one out. I\u2019d opt for other Ruth Ware novels over this one if you\u2019re new to this author\u2019s work. (If you\u2019re looking for a place to start, I really enjoyed One by One and The Death of Mrs. Westaway .) The Fury by Alex Michaelides Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Suspense / My rating: B- I will forever remember The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides as one of the few books out there that genuinely left me completely shocked. As I\u2019m sure most avid readers out there can attest, especially those who have read their fair share of thrillers, it\u2019s hard to feel genuinely shocked by a novel\u2026 and I\u2019m not talking just a little surprised but rather totally floored. The Silent Patient did that for me so my hopes for The Fury by the same author were sky-high. Alex Michaelides has a gift for roping a reader in immediately and creating captivating plotlines that keep you guessing and flying through the pages. Unfortunately with The Fury, the \u201ctwists\u201d weren\u2019t as shocking but almost more annoying and I\u2019d love to elaborate more but I know I\u2019d give away too much if I dive too much deeper. Suffice it to say, The Fury was a fast and entertaining page-turner but far from a favorite for me. From Amazon: This is a tale of murder. Or maybe that\u2019s not quite true. At its heart, it\u2019s a love story, isn\u2019t it? Lana Farrar is a reclusive ex\u2013movie star and one of the most famous women in the world. Every year, she invites her closest friends to escape the English weather and spend Easter on her idyllic private Greek island. I tell you this because you may think you know this story. You probably read about it at the time \u2015 it caused a real stir in the tabloids, if you remember. It had all the necessary ingredients for a press sensation: a celebrity; a private island cut off by the wind\u2026and a murder. We found ourselves trapped there overnight. Our old friendships concealed hatred and a desire for revenge. What followed was a game of cat and mouse \u2015 a battle of wits, full of twists and turns, building to an unforgettable climax. The night ended in violence and death, as one of us was found murdered. But who am I? My name is Elliot Chase, and I\u2019m going to tell you a story unlike any you\u2019ve ever heard.

It gives me such a good feeling every time I think of it! I appreciate all your ratings and critique/recommendations. There are two books I read this year that I enjoyed, The Life Impossible by Matt Haig and In Five Years by Rebecca Serle. Another good one was Wild Dark Shore by Charlotte McConaghy. The first two have the element of time travel in them. The last one is about a family of four living on an island South of Australia that is being swallowed up by rising sea waters. It\u2019s kind of a strange story but it moved fast. You can look up the synopsis on Amazon or goodreads! Reply Some great books I would recommend if you haven\u2019t read yet; The Lion Women of Tehran, The Return of Ellie Black, The Tell, There are Rivers in the Sky, The Light Pirate, Honor, The Four Winds, What the Wind Knows, The Heart\u2019s Invisible Furies, Pachinko, Necessary Lies, The Story Teller, Secrets of a Charmed Life and Your Second Life Begins When You Realize You Only Have One. \ud83d\ude42 Reply I recently read Colton Gentry\u2019s Third Act after seeing @beginathome recommend it, and I absolutely loved it! Reply I recently read Long Bright River by Liz Moore and loved it! Shortly after finishing I learned it was created into a show for Peacock but in true book to screen form\u2026the book is better!

By Digital Staff US pop star Katy Perry and Lauren S\u00e1nchez, fianc\u00e9e of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, are preparing to fly to the edge of space and back in a Blue Origin rocket. The launch from west Texas of the reusable New Shepard vehicle, operated by Bezos\u2019 space company, is scheduled for 8:30am on Monday (11:30pm AEST), although the timing may shift depending on weather conditions.

Blue Origin notes that this will be the first time since Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo flight in 1963 that a spacecraft will fly with only women aboard. The suborbital flight is expected to last just over 10 minutes and reach an altitude of 100km, taking the six passengers just above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an invisible boundary between earth\u2019s atmosphere and space. For comparison, the International Space Station orbits about 400km above earth. Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry and Gayle King are preparing to blast off. (AP PHOTO) Credit: AAP The Blue Origin crew will be able to briefly unbuckle and float weightless before returning to the Texas desert via a parachute-assisted landing. The New Shepard vehicle is fully automated \u2014 there are no pilots on the voyage. Blue Origin has been offering short trips for space tourists since 2021. The company has successfully completed 10 such missions, carrying 52 passengers to the edge of space. Bezos himself was aboard the inaugural crewed flight, and the company has gained attention for sending celebrities, however briefly, into space. Legendary Star Trek actor William Shatner boarded a flight in 2021.

Trusted security tools are being hijacked to deliver malware. Even after a breach is detected and patched, some attackers stay hidden. This week's events show a hard truth: it's not enough to react after an attack. You have to assume that any system you trust today could fail tomorrow. In a world where AI tools can be used against you and ransomware hits faster than ever, real protection means planning for things to go wrong \u2014 and still staying in control. Check out this week's update to find important threat news, helpful webinars, useful tools, and tips you can start using right away. \u26a1 Threat of the Week Windows 0-Day Exploited for Ransomware Attacks \u2014 A security affecting the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) was exploited as a zero-day in ransomware attacks aimed at a small number of targets, Microsoft revealed. The flaw, CVE-2025-29824, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain SYSTEM privileges. An exploit for the vulnerability has been found to be delivered via a trojan called PipeMagic, with the unknown threat actors, tracked by Microsoft as Storm-2460, conducting credential harvesting and dropping a ransomware payload as part of post-compromise exploitation activities. The exact nature of the payload is unclear, however, the ransom note dropped after encryption included a TOR domain tied to the RansomEXX ransomware family. CVE-2025-29824 was addressed by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update for April 2025. 2025 State of Code Security: Key Trends and Threats In cloud-native environments, the security of your code repositories and development pipelines is critical. Do you know the most pressing risks facing your organization today? By analyzing hundreds of thousands of repositories, the Wiz Threat Research team uncovered key vulnerabilities and attacker strategies in the new 2025 State of Code Security Report . Key stats include: 35% of GitHub repositories are public, providing malicious actors with easy access to exploits if developers make critical mistakes 61% of organizations have cloud secrets, like API keys and access tokens, exposed in public repositories Download the report to explore all the findings in detail and learn actionable strategies to protect your organization. Download the Report \u279d \ud83d\udd14 Top News ESET Flaw Exploited to Deliver New TCESB Malware \u2014 The China-aligned ToddyCat advanced persistent threat (APT) group exploited a vulnerability in ESET's antivirus software to silently execute a malicious payload called TCESB on infected devices. The dynamic link library (DLL) search order hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2024-11859) was patched in January after responsible disclosure. DLL search order hijacking is a kind of vulnerability that occurs when an application searches and loads a required DLL in an insecure order, such as starting with the current directory rather than a trusted system directory. In such instances, an attacker can try to trick the application into loading a malicious DLL as opposed to its legitimate counterpart. Once executed, TCESB reads the running kernel version and disables notification routines, installs a vulnerable driver for defense evasion, and launches an unspecified payload. Fortinet Warns of Hackers Retaining Access to Patched FortiGate VPNs Using Symlinks \u2014 Fortinet revealed that threat actors have found a way to maintain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the initial access vector used to breach the devices was patched. \"This was achieved via creating a symbolic link (aka symlink ) connecting the user file system and the root file system in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN,\" the company said . Fortinet has released patches to eliminate the behavior. AkiraBot Leans on OpenAI Models to Flood Sites with SEO Spam \u2014 An artificial intelligence (AI) powered platform called AkiraBot is being used to spam website chats, comment sections, and contact forms to promote dubious search engine optimization (SEO) services such as Akira and ServicewrapGO. The platform relies on OpenAI API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. As many as 80,000 websites have been successfully spammed by the tool since September 2024. In response to the findings, OpenAI has disabled the API key used by the threat actors. Gamaredon Uses Removable Drives to Distribute GammaSteel Malware \u2014 The Russia-linked threat actor known as Gamaredon targeted a foreign military mission based in Ukraine to deliver an updated version of a known malware called GammaSteel using what appears to be an already infected removable drive. The attack paves the way for a reconnaissance utility and an improved version of GammaSteel, an information stealer that's capable of exfiltrating files from a victim based on an extension allowlist from the Desktop and Documents folders. Palo Alto Networks Warns of Brute-Force Attempts Targeting PAN-OS GlobalProtect Portals \u2014 Palo Alto Networks has disclosed that it's observing brute-force login attempts against PAN-OS GlobalProtect gateways. It also noted that its activity monitoring the situation to determine its potential impact and identify if mitigations are necessary. The development came in response to an alert from GreyNoise about a spike in suspicious login scanning activity aimed at PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals since March 17, 2025. Trending CVEs Attackers love software vulnerabilities\u2014they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out. This week's list includes \u2014 CVE-2025-3102 (OttoKit plugin), CVE-2025-23359 (NVIDIA Container Toolkit), CVE-2025-30406 (Gladinet CentreStack), CVE-2025-29824 (Windows Common Log File System), CVE-2024-48887 (Fortinet FortiSwitch), CVE-2024-53150, CVE-2024-53197 (Google Android), CVE-2025-2945 (pgAdmin), CVE-2025-2244 (Bitdefender GravityZone), CVE-2025-31334 (WinRAR), CVE-2025-30401 (WhatsApp for Windows), CVE-2025-23120 (Rockwell Automation Industrial Data Center), CVE-2025-25211 , CVE-2025-26689 (Inaba Denki Sangyo CHOCO TEI WATCHER), CVE-2024-4872 , CVE-2024-3980 (Hitachi Energy MicroSCADA Pro/X SYS600), CVE-2025-2636 (InstaWP Connect \u2013 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin), CVE-2025-3439 (Everest Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Quiz, Survey, Newsletter & Payment Form Builder for WordPress plugin), and CVE-2025-31565 (WPSmartContracts plugin). \ud83d\udcf0 Around the Cyber World Bulletproof Hosting Service Provider Medialand Exposed \u2014 A bulletproof hosting service provider named Medialand has been exposed likely by the same actors behind the leak of Black Basta chat logs in February 2025. According to PRODAFT , Medialand has been linked to Yalishanda (LARVA-34), with the service playing a key role in enabling a wide range of cybercriminal operations, including hosting ransomware infrastructure for Black Basta, malware C2 servers, code-signing systems, phishing kits, data exfiltration panels, data leak sites. Leaked internal data reveals a treasure trove of information about who bought servers, who paid (including via cryptocurrency), and possibly personally identifiable information (PII), not to mention allow defenders to correlate indicators of compromise (IoCs) and improve attribution efforts. The Black Basta chat dataset shed light on the group's \"internal workflows, decision-making processes, and team dynamics, offering an unfiltered perspective on how one of the most active ransomware groups operates behind the scenes,\" Trustwave said . The discussions also revealed the group targeting individuals based on gender dynamics, assigning female callers to male victims and male operators to female targets. Furthermore, they also laid bare the threat actor's pursuit of security flaws and stockpiling them by paying premium prices to acquire zero-day exploits from exploit brokers to gain a competitive edge. Arabic-Speaking Threat Actor Targets South Korea with ViperSoftX \u2014 Suspected Arabic-speaking threat actors have been observed distributing ViperSoftX malware targeting South Korean victims since April 1, 2025. Often distributed via cracked software or torrents, ViperSoftX is known for its ability to exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised Windows hosts, as well as deliver additional payloads like Quasar RAT and TesseractStealer. In the attacks detected by AhnLab, the malware has been found to serve a malicious PowerShell script that drops PureCrypter and Quasar RAT. Irish Data Protection Watchdog Probes X \u2014 Ireland's data privacy regulator has opened an investigation into X over its processing of personal data from publicly accessible posts shared on the social network for purposes of training its artificial intelligence models, particularly Grok. \"The inquiry will examine compliance with a range of key provisions of the GDPR, including with regard to the lawfulness and transparency of the processing,\" the Data Protection Commission (DPC) said . \"The purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether this personal data was lawfully processed in order to train the Grok LLMs.\" X previously agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from E.U. users. Flaws Uncovered in Perplexity's Android App \u2014 An analysis of Perplexity AI's Android app has uncovered a set of 11 flaws, including hard-coded API keys, cross-origin resource sharing ( CORS ) misconfigurations, lack of SSL pinning, unsecured network configuration, tapjacking, and susceptibility to known flaws like Janus and StrandHogg, exposing users of the app to risks such as data theft, account takeovers, and reverse engineering attacks. \"Hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to steal your personal data, including sensitive login credentials,\" AppKnox said in a report shared with The Hacker News. \"The app lacks protections against hacking tools, leaving your device vulnerable to remote attacks.\" Similar flaws were also identified in DeepSeek's Android app earlier this year. Tycoon 2FA Phishing Kit Receives New Updates \u2014 The latest version of the phishing kit known as Tycoon 2FA has adopted new evasion techniques that allow it to slip past endpoints and detection systems. \"These include using a custom CAPTCHA rendered via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode characters in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to thwart inspection,\" Trustwave said . \"HTML5-based visuals like the custom CAPTCHA can mislead users and add legitimacy to phishing attempts. Unicode and Proxy-based obfuscation can delay detection and make static analysis more difficult.\" The development comes as the cybersecurity company said it has identified a dramatic increase in phishing attacks using malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, driven by PhaaS platforms like Tycoon 2FA, Mamba 2FA , and Sneaky 2FA . \"SVG-based attacks have sharply pivoted toward phishing campaigns, with a staggering 1,800% increase in early 2025 compared to data collected since April 2024,\" it said . China Reportedly Admits to Directing Cyber Attacks on US Critical Infra \u2014 Chinese officials have acknowledged in a secret meeting in December 2024 that it was behind a series of cyber attacks aimed at U.S. critical infrastructure, a cluster of activity that's known as Volt Typhoon, the Wall Street Journal reported , citing people familiar with the matter. The attacks are said to have been conducted in response to increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan. China had previously claimed Volt Typhoon to be a disinformation campaign from the West. AWS Debuts Support for ML-KEM in KMS, ACM, and Secrets Manager \u2014 Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced support for Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism ( ML-KEM ) for hybrid post-quantum key agreement in Key Management Service (AWS KMS), Certificate Manager (ACM), and Secrets Manager. \"These three services were chosen because they are security-critical AWS services with the most urgent need for post-quantum confidentiality,\" Amazon said . \"With this, customers can bring secrets into their applications with end-to-end post-quantum enabled TLS.\" The development comes as the OpenSSL Project released version 3.5.0 of its widely used cryptographic library with support for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. Exploitation Attempts Against TVT DVRs Surge \u2014 Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise is warning of a 3x spike in exploitation attempts against TVT NVMS9000 DVRs as part of what's suspected to be malicious activity designed to rope the devices into the Mirai botnet. The attacks exploit an information disclosure vulnerability (no CVE) that can be used to gain administrative control over affected systems. The surge in attacks began on March 31, 2025, with over 6,600 unique IP addresses, mainly from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, targeting systems located in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, attempting to exploit the flaw over the past 30 days. GitHub Announces General Availability of Security Campaigns \u2014 GitHub has announced the general availability of Security Campaigns, a new feature that aims to streamline the vulnerability remediation process using Copilot Autofix to generate code suggestions and resolve issues. The aim, per the Microsoft-owned platform, is to reduce security debt and quickly address problems lurking in existing codebases. \"Using Copilot Autofix to generate code suggestions for up to 1,000 code scanning alerts at a time, security campaigns help security teams take care of triage and prioritization, while you can quickly resolve issues using Autofix \u2013 without breaking your development momentum,\" GitHub said . Watch Out for SMS Pumping \u2014 Threat hunters are calling attention to a cybercrime tactic called SMS pumping fraud that exploits SMS verification systems (e.g., OTP requests or password resets) to generate excessive message traffic using fake or automated phone numbers, incurring businesses additional costs or disruptions. Such schemes employ automated bots or low-skilled workforce to trigger fake account creation and OTP requests, which send SMS messages to phone numbers controlled by the threat actor. \"The fraudster collaborates with a 'rogue party,' often a corrupt telecom provider or intermediary with access to SMS routing infrastructure,\" Group-IB said . \"The rogue party intercepts the inflated SMS traffic, typically avoiding message delivery to reduce costs. Instead, they route the traffic to numbers they control.\" Routers Among the Most Riskiest Devices in Enterprise Networks \u2014 According to data compiled by Forescout, network-related equipment such as routers have emerged as the riskiest category of IT devices. \"Driven by increased threat actor focus, adversaries are rapidly exploiting new vulnerabilities in these devices through large-scale attack campaigns,\" the company said. The retail sector has the riskiest devices on average, followed by financial services, government, healthcare, and manufacturing. Spain, China, the United Kingdom, Qatar, and Singapore are the top five countries with the riskiest devices on average. \"To effectively defend this evolving attack surface, organizations must adopt modern security strategies that address risk across all device categories,\" Forescout said . \"As threat actors continue shifting their focus away from traditional endpoints, they increasingly target less-protected devices that offer easier initial access.\" Spanish Authorities Arrest 6 for AI-Powered Investment Scam \u2014 The National Police of Spain has arrested six individuals aged between 34 and 57 behind a large-scale cryptocurrency investment scam that used AI tools to generate deepfake ads featuring popular public figures to deceive people, defrauding 208 victims worldwide of \u20ac19 million ($21.6 million). More than \u20ac100,000 of the total money defrauded from the victims has been frozen as part of the operation codenamed COINBLACK - WENDIMINE. \"The modus operandi used to carry out this scam consisted of inserting ads on different web pages as a hook related to investments in cryptocurrencies,\" the National Police said. \"The victims were not selected at random, but, through algorithms, they selected those people whose profile fit into what cybercriminals were looking for.\" The investment scam involved inserting ads on web pages and social media networks and using AI tools to falsely claim endorsements from famous personalities so as to entice the targets into making the investments. Some aspects of the scam were detailed by ESET in December 2024, which codenamed the campaign Nomani. Oracle Says Hack Affected \"Obsolete Servers\" \u2014 Oracle has confirmed that a hacker stole and leaked credentials that were stolen from what it described as \"two obsolete servers.\" However, the company downplayed the severity of the breach and insisted its cloud infrastructure (OCI) was not compromised and that no customer data and services were impacted by the incident. \"A hacker did access and publish user names from two obsolete servers that were never a part of OCI,\" it said in an email notification. \"The hacker did not expose usable passwords because the passwords on those two servers were either encrypted and/or hashed. Therefore the hacker was not able to access any customer environments or customer data.\" It's not known how many customers were affected. Atlas Lion Uses New Tactics in Attacks Targeting Retailers \u2014 The Moroccan threat actor known as Atlas Lion (aka Storm-0539) has been observed using stolen credentials to enroll attacker-controlled VMs into an organization's domain, per cybersecurity firm Expel. Known for its extensive understanding of the cloud, the group's primary goal appears to be redeeming or reselling the stolen gift cards they obtain during their attack campaigns. U.S. Treasury OCC Says Hackers Had Access to 150,000 Emails \u2014 The Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) revealed in February 2025 that it \"identified, isolated and resolved a security incident involving an administrative account in the OCC email system.\" As a result, a limited number of affected administrative accounts were identified and disabled. \"There is no indication of any impact to the financial sector at this time,\" the OCC said at the time. Now, in an update, the OCC has classified the breach as a \"major incident,\" adding \"the unauthorized access to a number of its executives' and employees' emails included highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes.\" Bloomberg reported that the unidentified threat actors behind the hack broke into an email system administrator's account and gained access to over 150,000 emails from May 2023 after intercepting about 103 bank regulators' emails. \ud83c\udfa5 Cybersecurity Webinars 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Learn to Detect and Block Hidden AI Tools in Your SaaS Stack \u2014 AI tools are quietly connecting to your SaaS apps \u2014 often without Security's knowledge. Sensitive data is at risk. Manual tracking won't keep up. In this session, learn: How AI tools are exposing your environment Real-world examples of AI-driven attacks How Reco helps detect and respond automatically Join Dvir Sasson from Reco to get ahead of hidden AI threats . 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Learn How to Secure Every Step of Your Identity Lifecycle \u2014 Identity is your new attack surface. AI-powered impersonation and deepfakes are breaking traditional defenses. Learn how to secure the full identity lifecycle \u2014 from enrollment to daily access to recovery \u2014 with phishing-resistant MFA, device trust, and Deepfake Defense\u2122. Join Beyond Identity and Nametag to stop account takeovers before they start. \ud83d\udd27 Cybersecurity Tools CAPE (Config and Payload Extraction) \u2014 CAPE is a powerful malware sandbox that runs suspicious files in a safe Windows environment and digs much deeper than traditional tools. It not only tracks file changes, network traffic, and memory dumps but also automatically unpacks hidden payloads, extracts malware settings, and defeats tricks used to avoid detection. With smart use of YARA rules and a built-in debugger, CAPE gives threat hunters and analysts a faster, clearer way to uncover what malware is really doing. MCP-Scan \u2014 It is an open-source security tool that checks your MCP servers for hidden risks like prompt injections, tool poisoning, and cross-origin attacks. It scans popular setups like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf, detects tampering in tool descriptions, and helps catch silent changes that could compromise your environment. With built-in protections like tool pinning and Invariant Guardrail checks, MCP-Scan gives developers and security teams a fast, reliable way to spot vulnerabilities before attackers can use them. \ud83d\udd12 Tip of the Week Monitoring for Unauthorized Account Activations \u2014 Attackers are using a clever trick to stay hidden inside networks: reactivating the built-in Windows Guest account. Normally, this account is disabled and ignored by system admins. But when attackers enable it and set a new password, it blends in as part of the system \u2014 making it easy for them to quietly log in, escalate privileges, and even access devices remotely through RDP. Since the Guest account looks normal at first glance, many security teams miss it during reviews. To catch this tactic early, monitor your security logs closely. Set alerts for Event ID 4722 \u2014 this signals when any disabled account is reactivated, including Guest. Also track the use of native Windows tools like net.exe, wmic, and PowerShell for any commands that modify accounts. Pay special attention to any Guest account being added to privileged groups like Administrators or Remote Desktop Users. Cross-check with your endpoint protection or EDR tools to spot changes outside normal maintenance windows. If you find an active Guest account, assume it's part of a larger breach. Check for signs of hidden accounts, unauthorized remote access tools, and changes to RDP settings. Regular threat hunting \u2014 even just checking that all default accounts are truly disabled \u2014 can break an attacker's persistence before they move deeper into your environment. Conclusion Every breach, every evasion technique, and every new tool attackers use is also a learning opportunity. If you're in cybersecurity today, your advantage isn't just your tech stack \u2014 it's how quickly you adapt. Take one tactic you saw in this week's update \u2014 privilege escalation, AI misuse, stealth persistence \u2014 and use it as a reason to strengthen a weak spot you've been putting off. Defense is a race, but improvement is a choice. Found this article interesting? Follow us on Twitter \uf099 and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.

All rights reserved. \u00d7 What's Hot LOADING ERROR LOADING Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump \u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Advertisement Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s strategy, \u201cexpressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\u201d Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. \u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says. Advertisement Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal\u2019s value fell to $750 million after Facebook\u2019s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion . WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta\u2019s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple\u2019s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Advertisement \u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\u201d the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\u201d This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Advertisement Meta\u2019s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta\u2019s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC\u2019s narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\u201d which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it\u2019s forced to spin off Instagram. Advertisement \u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d But Meta isn\u2019t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google\u2019s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. We Don't Work For Billionaires. We Work For You.

And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d Advertisement Related Instagram meta WhatsApp Hakeem Jeffries Shreds Pete Hegseth With Blistering DEI Burn John Oliver Warns 'We're F**ked' If This Trump-Induced Moment's On His Show Next Week Wall Street Journal Skewers Trump\u2019s Tariffs Chaos As A Triple Whammy For Americans Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

It does remind me of walking through walmart, in one of those center aisle clearance bins. They had $1 spices. I think I bought one, and was asking myself, what am I trying to accomplish here? Whatever it was, maybe nutmeg, bitter as hell and wasn't fit for any food, I threw it right in the bin. Might have been pine sawdust, or whatever common chinese wood there is. I met a guy from Hong Kong, who was telling me about a chinese scandal regarding soy sauce. They had made it from hair. And he was like, why would you do that, soy sauce is so cheap? Answer is, because they can, why not?

If you are cooking Indian or Mexican food, you need cumin and not caraway. Agree about using seeds when possible (potentially put seeds through a coffee grinder if you need some fresh powder, +/- roasting before grinding). Cumin is commonly tempered -- heated in a bit of oil to extract the flavor, then add the oil/spice combo to whatever is being cooked. It's easily an S tier spice.

I find cumin seeds much easier to find in ethnic stores than caraway, but for goulash or rye bread cumin does not quite cut it.

By Gizmodo Deals Published April 14, 2025 | \ud835\udd4f Copied! \u00a9 Samsung Amid rising tariffs and growing uncertainty in the electronics sector, consumers are bracing themselves for higher costs for flagship phones. As manufacturers and retailers adjust to these changes, Amazon is offering an outstanding deal on Samsung\u2019s latest flagship device, the Galaxy S25 Ultra . This deal significant because of the huge discount but it also beats the price on Samsung\u2019s official website. Now marked down to $1,099 on Amazon which is a 23% below its list price of $1,419 , the Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB is officially available for a record low price (previous low was $1,184). For comparison, Samsung\u2019s website sells the same model for $1,219, which only serves to highlight Amazon\u2019s advantage. We recommend you to act quickly, before tariffs push prices up even higher or supplies run low. See at Amazon Best iPhone Rival in 2025 The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung\u2019s innovation flagship and it was released in January 2025. It merges the newest hardware with advanced AI features to deliver a top-of-the-line experience. At its heart is Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (the most powerful chip from Qualcomm right now) specially designed for Galaxy phones. The chip offers huge performance improvements including faster processing speeds and better AI capabilities\u2014ideal for multitasking, gaming, and CPU-intensive apps. We also love Samsung\u2019s S25 Ultra display: Its massive 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen offers QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz with the promise of rich colors and silky-smooth graphics for gaming or streaming. The display reaches a brightness of up to 2,600 nits which makes it perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. The display is topped with Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2 to avoid scratch and accidental drops. We also all know that Samsung is one of the best regarding photography. The Galaxy S25 Ultra quad-camera setup includes a 200MP wide-angle lens with optical image stabilization that captures stunningly detailed photos with rich colors and sharp contrasts. There\u2019s also a brand-new 50MP ultra-wide sensor which excels at landscape and macro photography, and two telephoto lenses with 5x and 3x optical zoom allow users to capture clear images of distant objects. The front 12MP camera delivers high-quality selfies and video calls. Battery life is another area where the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn\u2019t disappoint: The big 5,000mAh battery delivers all-day performance despite heavy workloads. Quick wired charging at 45W and wireless charging at 20W offer quick top-ups as and when needed. Reverse wireless charging is also available on this phone which allows you to top up other devices on the go. On the software side, the Galaxy S25 Ultra runs Android 15 with Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 interface . The user-friendly software provides productivity tools like Seamless Actions Across Apps and Now Brief to multitask with ease. Samsung has also assured seven years of OS updates for this device with a commitment to long-term support and security patches. Our advice: Order one now before tariffs drive prices up (or stocks run out). See at Amazon Daily Newsletter Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

However, those are meant premium segment products and are not an option for those looking for a budget gaming laptop. That is where today's deal comes in which is in the form of the Acer Aspire A15-41M-R8Y2 SKU priced at just $400 ( purchase link under the specs list below ). This laptop is powered by a Ryzen 5 8640HS , which is a hexa-core APU based on the Zen 4 microarchitecture. Keep in mind that AMD now distinguishes an APU from a CPU despite both of them having on-board integrated graphics processors (IGP). The key difference is that the IGP on CPUs is typically much weaker than that on the APUs. The Ryzen 8000 HX lineup (linked at the top) is a CPU while the Ryzen 8000HS series is an APU. That is because the 8640HS has Radeon 760M IGP powered by eight RNDA 3 graphics compute units (CUs) that clock up to 2600 MHz. The laptop has 8GB of system memory and 512 GB of M.2 NVMe SSD, which should be plenty for gaming as long as you are not looking to store an entire library of games. The 8GB DDR5 RAM is soldered but there is an empty slot for expanding it to 16GB. This should help immensely as it would double the memory bandwidth which is crucial for good performance of integrated graphics as IGPs see the system memory as VRAM. The other specs of the Acer Aspire A15-41M-R8Y2 are given below: Operating System: Windows 11 Home Display: 15.6\" Full HD (1920 x 1080), 16:9 aspect ratio, 60 Hz RAM: 8 GB DDR5 SDRAM Storage: 512 GB SSD Connectivity: USB 3.0, USB 4.0, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 Battery: 53 Wh Maximum Power Supply Wattage: 65 W Weight: 1.65 kg Get the Acer Aspire AMD Ryzen 8640HS laptop at the link below: Acer Aspire 15 Laptop | 15.6\" FHD Display | AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS Hexa-Core Processor | AMD Radeon Graphics | 8GB DDR5 | 512GB Gen 4 SSD | Wi-Fi 6E | AI PC | Copilot Key | Microsoft Pluton | Backlit Keyboard | A15-41M-R8Y2: $399.99 (Amazon US) (MSRP: $549.99) This Amazon deal is US-specific and not available in other regions unless specified.

For context, always refer to the full article. DEPARTMENT STORE. The entrance of SM Store in Makati City. SM Investments Corporation INFO 'While Gen X and millennials still lead in terms of purchasing power, we\u2019re strategically investing in Gen Z as they become an increasingly influential consumer group,' says SM Retail executive vice president Jonathan Ng MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Digital natives don\u2019t do everything online. SM Retail in 2024 saw Gen Zs spending 13% more by buying goods at SM\u2019s physical department stores, prompting the retail giant to strategically invest more to engage with the younger generation. \u201cFilipino shoppers, especially Gen Z, are more experiential and tactile in their shopping preferences,\u201d SM Retail executive vice president Jonathan Ng said in a statement on Monday, April 14. \u201cAt SM Store, we are dedicated to evolving to meet these expectations, investing in modern store designs and enhancing customer service to stay ahead of the curve.\u201d The company defines Gen Zs as those born between 1997 and 2012. Citing data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, SM noted that Gen Zs now make up 38% of the country\u2019s population, which is estimated to be around 114.12 million in 2025 . SM is now shifting to marketing to students in their teenage years and workers in their first few years of employment. \u201cWhile Gen X and millennials still lead in terms of purchasing power, we\u2019re strategically investing in Gen Z as they become an increasingly influential consumer group,\u201d Ng said. The company noted that in a 2024 study by The Fourth Wall and Uniquecorn Strategies , they found that 31% of 400 Gen Z respondents prefer shopping in physical stores because of \u201ctrust issues\u201d \u2014 being cautious about getting scammed online. These are usually the older Gen Zs in their mid to late 20s. The study also noted that most Gen Z shoppers are in the market for brands that are authentic and aligned with their personalities and beliefs. Must Read [Good Business] The Gen Z effect: When purpose meets profit A big majority of Gen Zs, however, still prefer online shopping on sites such as Shopee (42%), Lazada (16%), Tiktok Shop (9%), Instagram (2%), Facebook (1%), and Amazon. But when Gen Zs do shop in person \u2014 at least once a week according to a global study by Adyen released in January 2025 \u2014 visiting physical stores is an experience, which SM may be well-prepared for with personal shoppers ready to help customers. \u201cSM is all about excellent customer service,\u201d said Ng. SM Retail scored a 5% increase in both net income and retail revenues, ending 2024 with P20.9 billion and P434.5 billion, respectively. \u2013 Rappler.com Must Read Gen Z\u2019s sustainability mindset reshaping retail; Shein says it is taking note Add a comment Error.

Project Censored Award Jesse H. Neal Award See Full Bio REUTERS/Nathan Howard \u2014 Trump\u2019s legal serfs: when law firms bow to the Don. Trump is bragging about how he\u2019s forced f ive more major US law firms to kiss his a-- and give away $940 million in free services to his favorite causes . So far, the rogues gallery of cowardly law firms which have put money above principle includes Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, Allen Overy Shearman Sterling, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, Paul Weiss, Skadden Milbank & Willkie, and Farr & Gallagher. On the other hand, three major firms are suing Trump\u2019s administration for their efforts to intimidate and extort them (my words, not theirs), including Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale. And over 1600 attorneys who work for the big firms that have bowed down to Trump\u2019s intimidation have signed a letter demanding they do better. They wrote : \u201cWhen we are united, we cannot be intimidated. These tactics only work if the majority does not speak up. Our hope was that our employers, some of the most profitable law firms in the world, would lead the way. That has not yet been the case.\u201d One of the very first things authoritarians do when they seize control of a country \u2014 from Hitler in the 1930s to Putin in the early 2000s \u2014 is to seize control of the country\u2019s legal system. Typically they follow a twofold strategy of punishing independent judges and terrifying attorneys; Trump is doing both with a shocking level of speed and zeal. This is how democracy dies, not with a bang but with a pro bono agreement. \u2014 The Empire shudders: how Trump\u2019s trade tantrum could trigger America\u2019s fall. China can destroy Trump (and America) if Mark Carney doesn\u2019t do the job first: China produces 90% of the world\u2019s rare earth minerals, which America needs to build chips, jet engines, advanced displays, missiles, avionics, and a whole spectrum of other applications, many specific to the military and advanced computer manufacturing. And on April 4th , in response to Trump\u2019s first tariff tantrum, they put export controls on the seven (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium) most critical for US manufacturers and the US military. We have some reserves, but if this lasts for months it could seriously damage our military and advanced manufacturing capabilities. Trump appears to believe that President Xi will come to him any day now to \u201ckiss my a--\u201d (as he bragged a few days ago about other governments\u2019 leaders), but the Chinese dictator is showing no signs of bending or bowing, responding to Trump\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d 145% tariffs with a blanket 125% tariff of their own. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \u2014 himself the former Chairman of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada (the equivalents of our Fed) \u2014 got together last week with leaders of Europe and Japan to plan their response to Trump. About $8.5 trillion of the US\u2019 $36 trillion national debt is held by foreign governments (as Treasuries), including $350 billion by Canada, $1 trillion by Japan, and between $1.5 and $2 by the EU. If they were to coordinate the process of dumping their bonds, he reportedly suggested, it would flood the market with US bonds and make it harder for the the American Treasury Department to sell new debt issues, forcing us to increase the rate of interest we pay. This would drive up US mortgages and other credit, make it harder for companies to finance expansion and new operations, and increase the cost to the US government to fund our own debt: the result, if sustained over a few months, could be devastating. And, sure enough, it appears that\u2019s exactly what they did this past week when bond yields shot up, forcing Trump to put a 90-day pause on most of his tariffs. This threatens America\u2019s position as the holder of the world\u2019s reserve currency, as well as possibly producing a liquidity crisis similar to what had Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsen\u2019s hands trembling when, in 2008, he announced that the nation\u2019s banking system had \u201cfrozen up\u201d and needed a multi-trillion-dollar bailout from Congress and our Fed (which Bush gave to the banks and their executives), and throw America into a severe recession or possibly even a second Republican Great Depression. Should Carney, et al , continue dumping US debt and China jump in by bailing on their $760 billion in treasuries, it could bring our financial system to its knees just as Republicans in Congress are trying to raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion (which will have to be borrowed by selling that amount in treasuries) to fund their planned $4.5 trillion tax gift to America\u2019s billionaires. Highlighting the danger, the headline in yesterday\u2019s Financial Times is, for finance experts, a virtual primal scream: Liquidity worsens in $29tn Treasury market as volatility soars . Hang onto your seats (and your assets): this could get insanely wild \u2014 and dangerous for all of us \u2014 before long. (And it\u2019s amazing how the mainstream media is missing/ignoring these two stories.) \u2014 Was there a \u201clack of urgency\u201d in the Supreme Court deportation ruling about the Maryland father wrongly deported to El Salvador\u2019s most notorious prison? You Betcha... Will the Republican justices keep sucking up to Trump? Is a frog\u2019s a-- watertight? The Supreme Court issued one of the most mumbling, mealy-mouthed decisions in a century, giving Trump\u2019s gestapo plenty of time to continue the torture of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the husband of a US citizen and father of three (including a nonverbal autistic child) along with over 200 others, over 70% of whom have no criminal record according to CBS. The Trump regime\u2019s lawyers went to court yesterday and basically stalled, saying they didn\u2019t know where Garcia is or what his status is, a clear and naked lie. If nothing else, when El Salvador\u2019s hard-right (arguably neo-Nazi) president Nayib Bukele visits the White House this coming Monday, he could simply bring Garcia and the others with him. But don\u2019t hold your breath; he and Trump are both gleeful about their ability to incarcerate and torture a legal US resident without any legal due process in complete violation of the US Constitution and international law. The simple reality is that Trump is transforming America into a police state, step by step, and aligning himself with some of the planet\u2019s worst autocrats while crapping on our closest allies\u2026just like I\u2019ll bet Putin taught him how to do. \u2014 Seniors are first in the line of fire as Trump\u2019s tariff bomb explodes. Top Senate Democrats just proposed an emergency Social Security payment boost: Senators Chuck Schumer, Ron Wyden, and Elizabeth Warren are putting forward legislation to increase the monthly Social Security payments of everybody in the country by $200 a month to compensate for the coming Trump tariff inflation. The Social Security Emergency Inflation Relief Act is a response to the early signs that inflation \u2014 and shortages \u2014 are about to explode as both major and minor retailers across the nation are cancelling orders for Chinese goods rather than pay a 145% import tax (tariff). These cancellations will produce shortages and drive up prices, hitting low income people the hardest (as Republican policies always do). If nothing changes over the next week or two, expect major inflationary impact to sweep America starting in a big way next month. Meanwhile, Republicans promise to kill this Senate effort to give a raise to people on Social Security, because it may show down their plan to hand trillions to their billionaire benefactors. Finally, I\u2019m already seeing signs that America has already slipped into a recession: Every time we\u2019ve had a recession in the 22 years I\u2019ve been doing my radio show, the early indicator is that advertisers begin to cut back on their ad budgets for radio. I heard from our ad agency this week that this has begun, so we\u2019re looking at ways to tighten our belts, financially speaking. I predict, based on this \u201cearly warning system\u201d that hasn\u2019t failed me yet, that we\u2019ll all see the impact of the Trump recession within a few weeks. We gave Trump a loaded gun and he pointed it straight at our feet and began blasting away. Will this break the spell this cult leader has on his followers? Stay tuned. \u2014 Authoritarian Alert! There\u2019s a new dress code in Trump\u2019s Washington, and it\u2019s straight out of a dictator\u2019s playbook. Remember Mao Zedong and those little red pins with a gold image of his head on them? Stalin had them, too, as does Kim Jong Un; as Dean Blundell notes , if you fail to wear your Kim pin properly, you can get arrested in North Korea. Trump apparently loved the idea of having similar pins with his head on them, as do some of his cabinet members; FCC Chairman Brendan Carr was spotted wearing a Trump head pin in DC this week. Trump\u2019s apparently selling pure gold versions, although you can get gold-like ones on amazon for as little as ten bucks. What\u2019s next? A mandate that we all carry a little booklet of Trump\u2019s most famous sayings? (\u201cI moved on her like a b-----. I couldn't get there and she was married. \u2026 You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p-----. You can do anything.\u201d) G-d help us all\u2026 \u2014 The SAVE Act: What could possibly go wrong with the House-passed bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote \u2014 Hillary sends out a warning about it \u2014 I've been warning about this for months! I\u2019ve written several times about the GOP\u2019s latest strategy to purge millions of American women from the nation\u2019s voting rolls with their new SAVE Act, which passed the House this past week (with the votes of four democrats: Ed Case (HI), Henry Cuellar (TX), Jared Golden (ME), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA). They\u2019re doing this because women are about 7% more likely to vote Democratic than men. As Hillary Clinton noted on Xitter yesterday: \u201cThe House just passed the Republican voter suppression measure that threatens voting access for millions of Americans, including 69 million women whose married names don\u2019t match their birth certificates.\u201d Ever since 1980, when Heritage Foundation co-founder Paul Weyrich proclaimed the goal of the GOP should be to \u201creduce the voting population,\u201d the party has sponsored thousands of pieces of legislation \u2014 hundreds of which have been made into law \u2014 to make it harder to register, harder to vote, and easier to get purged from voting rolls or have your vote thrown out. This bill, which will next be debated in the Senate (will Fetterman join Republicans and vote for it like these four turncoat Dems did in the House?), is the most serious assault on women\u2019s right to vote since Republicans first opposed the 19th Amendment in 1920. Let your senators know you\u2019re not happy and they should vote to filibuster and then defeat it. \u2014 Crazy Alert! The next market crash or maybe even a war may be engineered by a robot \u2014 and nobody will be accountable. \u201c Evil robots\u201d could start a financial crisis or a world war in order to profit the corporations that own them, without those corporations even knowing about it? The Bank of England \u2014 not an organization prone to conspiracy thinking \u2014 issued a warning this week about what might happen when stock trading firms deploy AI robots to handle making money for them. The fear is that the robots will figure out what Naomi Klein wrote an entire book about: Disasters represent an opportunity to make big bucks. If an AI computer could infiltrate an air traffic control system and crash a plane, for example, right after betting big on airline stocks falling, it could make a fortune for its owners. The Bank\u2019s report noted , \u201cModels might learn that stress events increase their opportunity to make profit and so take actions actively to increase the likelihood of such events.\u201d They added: \u201cAI could facilitate collusion or other forms of market manipulation\u201d without the \u201chuman manager\u2019s intention or awareness.\u201d Yikes! Maybe it\u2019s time for some legislation to get this genie under control?

Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, a US author and philanthropist, also joined the passengers on board the flight, which blasted off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). The flight took around 10 minutes and the rocket returned safely to the ground by parachute. The remaining crew included TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. King's close friend, talk show legend Oprah Winfrey, was among those watching the launch in Texas. \"It's oddly quiet when you get up there... you look down at the planet and think, 'That's where we came from?' And to me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better and be better,\" King said. Monday's venture features the first all-woman space crew since Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. 10-minute flight to the edge of space The passengers were carried more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface \u2014 beyond the Karman line, the internationally recognized boundary of space. The fully automated craft rose vertically before the crew capsule separated in mid-flight, before returning to the ground in a fall braked by parachutes and a retro rocket. Perry, known for hits such as \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls,\" and her co-passengers had the chance to experience weightlessness for a brief period during the trip. \"I feel super connected to love,\" Katy Perry said after landing back on Earth. She was holding a daisy flower, which she took into space, to remind her of her daughter, Daisy. Ahead of the trip she told Elle magazine that she was going on the trip for Daisy, whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.\" \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space,'\" Perry added. Space tourism taking off Other prominent figures among the 52 previous Blue Origin passengers include longtime \"Star Trek\" star William Shatner . But Blue Origin, which does not publicly say how much such a trip costs, aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. Virgin Galactic , founded by English business magnate Richard Branson, also offers similar sub-orbital trips to those wanting to travel to space and in possession of the high sums of money to do so.

It is so designed to cut a box, a closed volume, which bifurcates into two separated to create two separate units, each with its own garden and no introspection. The rooms of the house are arranged around the patio, allowing the penetration of light into the core of the house. The privacy and quiet of the patio is combined with the aesthetic qualities and the expression of elegance by the dark walls.The building structure is made of wood and covered with slabs of thick ceramic panels mounted on a ventilated wall.

Regularly $299, this is $70 off, matching the price you\u2019ll pay for a refurbished set right now straight from Bose , and the lowest we can find. This deal is also matched as part of the now live, weeklong Best Buy Spring Sale \u2013 details on that await right here . While we have seen refurbished sets of the latest Ultra Open down as low as $180 a couple times this year, and even a quick drop over at Woot for the black set in brand new condition at the same $180, it\u2019s not often we see the other colors drop below $229 \u2013 once during the holidays last year we saw the champagne/off-white Diamond 60th Anniversary Edition set drop to $199. It is also worth noting that the previous Woot deal on the black set, did not include a full 1-year Bose warranty, but rather 90-day Woot coverage. The Open buds are very much what they sound like, delivering Bose\u2019s floating wear experience, as opposed to having to jam them right up into your ears like traditional buds. They also happen to be some of the best open buds I have tried out, by way of a cuff-like fit while still delivering solid audio and a private listening experience. Bose says they leave \u201cyour ears open to hear the world around you while OpenAudio technology delivers rich, private sound\u201d alongside up to 7 hours of playback time (the included charging case provides 2.5 additional charges) and the IPX4 water resistance. Hit up our launch coverage for more details. Bose Ultra Open Earbuds feature: Hear all of what\u2019s around you while enjoying rich, private sound; the wireless earbuds\u2019 open ear design says, \u201cI can still hear you\u201d while OpenAudio technology provides you with high-quality, private sound. With Bose Immersive Audio spatialized sound, these Bluetooth earbuds feel, look good, and bring you closer to your music, so you\u2019re not only listening, you\u2019re in it. The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds feature a flexible joint and a light-as-air-grip, simply hook it gently around the back of your ear and you\u2019ll stay open to the world around you with these comfortable earbuds.

That's the company he left when he entered politics. Today's episode is not a look back at Carney\u2019s time at Brookfield. It's about right now. Because among all of those claims and arguments about Carney and Brookfield and the past, there's something else that hasn\u2019t made as many headlines. An allegation about an ongoing connection between Carney and Brookfield. Is he still financially connected to Brookfield in any way, or is he not? Our reporter, Julian Abraham, tried to answer that question, and by the end of today's episode, you're going to know what Mark Carney isn't telling you about Brookfield.

Is Pierre Actually a Girl's Girl? 39:54 | Tuesday, April 8, 2025 | Ep. 1137 Last week, Pierre Poilievre said tick tock goes your biological clock. This was the first time that host Noor Azrieh noticed, during the campaign, that someone (anyone!) was speaking to women directly and explicitly. And it prompted a wave of pushback\u2026and some praise. The gap between men and women is widening. If the election happened today, and only women voted, Mark Carney would be on track for the biggest landslide in Canadian history. Gender gaps have been a mainstay of Canadian politics for years, but never quite like this. In this episode, we\u2019re diving into the minds of voters. What are they thinking about when they head to the polls? And the latest on Trump\u2019s tariff tantrums, Poilievre\u2019s big news on drug policy, the NDP\u2019s rent control dream, and is it defund the CBC or refund the CBC\u2026we can\u2019t tell anymore.

Election Dysfunction and Bozo Eruptions 32:46 | Monday, April 7, 2025 | Ep. 1136 In the last 50 or so years the number of independent first-time political candidates elected to office in Canada could fit in a car. Five candidates have made it to, albeit a very small portion of political power, without party support. That covers both provincial and federal elections.As Canadian elections become increasingly presidential affairs, focusing on the personality at the top of the ticket, the quality that seems most necessary in an aspiring MP is fealty to the Party, the leader, the mantra.The pressures of social media, political parties\u2019 reliance on marketing data, and the 24-hour news cycle all play a part in the clamping down on new or maverick voices.What is the cost of canceling out the independent voice in our MPs? And how did we get here?Alex Marland, author of No I in Team: Party Loyalty in Canadian Politics and Whipped: Party Discipline in Canada has interviewed hundreds of politicians trying to answer those questions.Host: Jesse BrownCredits: Tristan Capacchione (Audio Editor & Technical Producer), Bruce Thorson (Senior Producer), max collins (Director of Audio), Jesse Brown (Editor and Publisher)Fact checking by Julian AbrahamAdditional music by Audio NetworkFurther Reading:Alex Marland \u2014 Acadia UniversitySponsors: PolicyMe: Get Covered in Minutes\u2014No Hassle, No Hidden Fees.

Saw somewhere that this is 50 Watts and that very low.

The film will be a Japanese-French co-production at Yuasa's new studio ame pippin , and will release in 2026. Image via Amazon \u00a9 Banana Yoshimoto, Yoshitomo Nara, Gentosha The anime film is based on Banana Yoshimoto 's Hinagiku no Jinsei novel (pictured at right), which Gentosha published in April 2006. The novel features illustrations by Yoshitomo Nara . Sachiko Tanaka ( Before We Vanish, Asaki I & II ) is the screenwriter for the film as her first anime work. Original novel illustrator Nara is designing the characters. ASMIK Ace is producing the film. French studio Miyu Productions ( Ghost Cat Anzu , A New Dawn ) is co-producing the film. Producers from Miyu include Emmanuel-Alain Raynal and Pierre Baussaron . Variety describes the story: \u201c Daisy's Life \u201d follows the emotional journey of a six-year-old girl named Daisy, who loses her mother in a tragic accident and struggles to adapt to life with her aunt. One sleepless night, she encounters a mysterious girl named Dahlia at her window. Their days together begin to transcend time and space, bringing a cosmic perspective to Daisy's modest life in a downtown yakisoba restaurant. Yuasa launched the ame pippin studio in February in collaboration with ASMIK Ace, Aniplex , and CoMix Wave Films . The studio's website lists Yuasa as CEO and co-founder. Yuasa started as a key animator for such anime as Doraemon: Nobita's Animal Planet and The Legend of the Dog Warriors: The Hakkenden . He moved on to Crayon Shin-chan where he was animation director on a number of episodes, and did animation work on the franchise films. Yuasa co-founded Science SARU with Eunyoung Choi in 2013. The duo's \"Food Chain\" episode of the American animated series Adventure Time earned them an Annie Award nomination in 2014. Yuasa's major anime credits as director include Japan Sinks: 2020 , DEVILMAN crybaby , Kemonozume , Kick-Heart , Lu over the wall , Mind Game , Ride Your Wave , Ping Pong , The Tatami Galaxy , and Kaiba . Yuasa retired as president of the studio Science SARU in March 2020. He most recently directed INU-OH , the musical anime feature film of Hideo Furukawa 's Heike Monogatari : Inu-Oh no Maki (Tales of the Heike: Inu-Oh) novel. The film opened in Japan in May 2022.

We also love how lightweight and ergonomically it is designed: At 5.6 pounds, it feels super comfortable to push around and to use for extended periods without tiredness. Its motor and battery are carefully situated around the handle to maximize balance which makes effortless floor-to-ceiling cleaning easy. Dyson also offers an advanced filtration system that traps 99.99% of particles as minute as 0.3 microns . The Dyson V8 Extra has a maximum of 40 minutes of fade-free cleaning on a fully charged battery which provides you with all the time you require for almost any cleaning task. You can choose between two modes \u2014standard mode for regular cleaning and max mode to eliminate tough dirt\u2014with which you can adjust the desired power level according to your personal needs. Super useful is also the fact that the vacuum easily detaches t o act as a handheld cleaner for surfaces on stairs, upholstery, and automobiles plus other difficult spots. The vacuum comes with nine Dyson-developed accessories that include the anti-tangle hair screw tool that allows for an easy removal of pet hair on tight spaces and an extension tube that provides an additional 24 inches of rubberized reach. With the upcoming tariff increases that will drive prices up on everything, we really recommend you to buy now what you really need \u2013 and this Dyson vacuum cleaner is probably the bet you can get for such a discounted/low price.

Read Today's Paper Diesel demand growth falls to lowest since pandemic SECTIONS Diesel demand growth falls to lowest since pandemic PTI Last Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 04:11:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis India's diesel demand growth hit a pandemic-era low in fiscal year 2024-25, rising just 2% due to a slowing economy and the increasing adoption of electric vehicles. While diesel still dominates the transport sector, the shift to EVs in public transport and logistics is moderating its growth. Reuters A worker fills diesel in a container at a fuel station Growth in demand for diesel, India's most consumed petroleum product, fell to its lowest since the pandemic in the financial year ended March 31 as the economy expands at a slower pace and consumption shifts to cleaner fuels. Diesel consumption rose 2 per cent to 91.4 million tonnes in 2024-25 (April 2024 to March 2025) fiscal, according to provisional data released by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Oil Ministry. The growth in demand for diesel, which is used to power trucks and farm machinery, in 2024-25 was slower than 4.3 per cent in the previous fiscal and 12.1 per cent in 2022-23. Diesel accounts for about 40 per cent of oil used in India. Softness in demand growth mirrors economic activity in the country. But more than the economy, it is Electric Vehicles (EVs) which are starting to reshape diesel demand in India. Industry officials said diesel still powers three-fourth of India's transport sector but the growth is moderating due to the EV shift. The slower consumption rise compared to petrol was largely due to the commercial EV shift. Live Events Electric buses are being rapidly adopted in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, and electric auto-rickshaws (e-rickshaws) have become dominant in many tier-2 and tier-3 cities, directly cutting diesel use in urban public transport. Also, companies like Amazon, Flipkart, and BigBasket are switching their delivery fleets to EVs. This shift primarily affects diesel-driven vans and LCVs (Light Commercial Vehicles), reducing demand in the logistics sector. Petrol consumption rose 7.5 per cent to 40 million tonnes while LPG demand was up 5.6 per cent to 31.32 million tonnes. Reflecting boom in the aviation sector, jet fuel consumption was up nearly 9 per cent at about 9 million tonnes in 2024-25. Demand for naphtha, which is used as a fuel in industries, fell 4.8 per cent to 13.15 million tonnes while fuel oil consumption was down nearly a per cent at 6.45 million tonnes. Bitumen, used in road construction, saw consumption fall 5.4 per cent at 8.33 million tonnes. Petroleum coke demand was up 8.6 per cent and so was that of lubricants and greases whose use rose 12.3 per cent. Overall, petroleum production consumption in India was up 21 per cent at 239.171 million tonnes. This growth was slower than the 5 per cent rise in 2023-24, 10.6 per cent in the preceding year and 3.8 per cent in 2021-22. Oil consumption growth in 2024-25 was the slowest in a decade if the two Covid-marred years of 2019-20 and 2020-21 are excluded. During 2019-20 and 2020-21, oil demand fell as the country was under lockdown in most parts to prevent the spread of the pandemic. For the current fiscal which started from April 1, PPAC has projected a 5.7 per cent growth in oil demand to nearly 253 million tonnes. Diesel consumption is projected to rise by 3 per cent to 94.1 million tonnes and petrol by 6.5 per cent to 42.63 million tonnes.

A set of Tide sink packs if you have a goal to pack fewer clothes and re-wear more of the items you're bringing. These will make it so simple to do so. No washing machine required! www.amazon.com Each pack comes with three packets. And, because they *are* liquid, they'll easily slide into the side of your toiletries bag. Promising review : \" Game changer for travel! We were gone for two weeks, and I was able to wash all the clothes I had packed! Helped with using only a carry-on for the trip and kept my clothes fresh and clean! So easy to use and smelled nice! Will never travel without them again!\" \u2014 Kristy Get nine packs from Amazon for $6.39 . 2. A suitcase cover because you didn't spend your hard-earned Christmas bonus on swanky new luggage just to be too scared that baggage handlers might nick it that you never actually put it to use. Plus, thanks to the fact that it's clear, your fellow travelers will still be able to \ud83d\udc40 you have expensive taste. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought an off-white carry-on and realized how easily it could get dirty and scratched. So, I purchased this protector. It\u2019s clear, is a nice thick durable plastic cover, and has Velcros at the bottom. It fits perfectly. I did measure my bag without including the wheels as recommended. Love it!!!\" \u2014 MsLucy Get it from Amazon for $10.39+ (available in six sizes). 3. A pack of EarPlanes \u2014 earplugs designed to help ease the pain that comes with the sudden pressure change during takeoff. These are also great if you're driving to a destination at high altitude or if you're simply just trying to drown out the sound of a crying baby so you can sleep. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Never fly without these! Before I found these, I endured excruciating pain in my ears upon descent and landing. Felt like a hot poker being driven into each ear. My ears would also be plugged up, and it would often take two to three days for them to resume their normal state of being. I insert them about an hour before landing, as the plane is making its slow descent. I'm comfortable, and the most discomfort I experience is a slight adjustment of pressure in my sinus. NO PAIN. NO TEARS.\" \u2014 K. Tombrella Get a pair from Amazon for $7.69 (also available in multi-packs). 4. A portable digital luggage scale because the year is 2025, and it's time we put an end to that gut-wrenching moment the airline counter tells you your suitcase is a few pounds over the weight limit. Being forced to transfer your things from your suitcase into your carry-on in the middle of the terminal for everyone to see is dreadful. www.amazon.com You can also switch between pound and kilogram measurements. My colleague Elizabeth Lilly tested this luggage scale out when packing for a trip to Iceland \u2014 check out her demo of how it works on TikTok ! Promising review: \"We used this on a six-flight trip across Europe and it made it easy to know that we repacked our bags according to the various weight limits. Some bags had a 10-kg limit, and some had a 50-lb limit, so it was convenient to switch back and forth between units (even though dividing by 2.2 isn't exactly rocket science).\" \u2014 Zac Get it from Amazon for $7.64+ (available in four colors and a two-pack). 5. A TSA-friendly toiletries kit featuring a pack of four travel bottles, three little jars, two toothbrush caps, a set of labels, and a clear pouch to store them all away in. Keeping all of your liquids contained in this kit should help make getting through security a bit smoother. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly gives this kit her stamp of approval! \"I own and love this set! ... I've used this set on more than five trips, and for trips when I don't require body wash or shampoo (like to visit my parents), I use the extra room in the bag to shove in all my beauty products and daily contacts. Plus! It comes with labels that stay on the containers really well despite my thoroughly washing these containers between trips. I bought this set in spring 2019 and have, admittedly, lost a container or two. But the ones that I've held on to over dozens of trips have all held up well!\" Promising review: \"I used this recently on a trip to Europe. They worked great, had no leaks, and got through security in my carry-on just fine. I\u2019m glad to have these for future trips.\" \u2014 Rachel Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in three variations). 6. And if you already have miniature toiletries, then just get this set of three TSA-approved clear cases perfect for holding your travel-sized beauty/hygiene essentials. You can use one case for your shower products/shampoo, another for your skincare items, and another for your cosmetics! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I will never travel again without these \u2014 crystal clear so going through security is a breeze. Never expected these to hold up \u2014 at this price, I though one and done...nope, amazingly durable! Now I want a bunch to organize all my cosmetics, creams, and hair products, as they are still crystal clear after many uses. A steal of a deal!\" \u2014 Ellen Higgins Get a pack of three from Amazon for $11.04 (available in seven colors). 7. A set of packing cubes to not only make packing feel less overwhelming (because all your stuff will have a place!!!) but also make unpacking a breeze because you'll actually know where your stuff is! Think about how nice it's gonna be to open your suitcase and see some order rather than an overflowing mess! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I am officially sold on packing cubes!! These things are amazing! I can't believe I've been packing without them my whole life. The mesh lining allows you to peek inside, and I was able to pack all my clothes, shoes, and toiletries for a 10-day trip to Europe (full contents listed below). I packed them as I normally would first and then packed them in the packing cubes. There was SO much more room in my luggage after packing everything in the cubes! Items I fit in the cubes and bag include 2 jackets, 1 jean vest, 4 pants/capris, 2 pairs of shorts, 1 romper, 4 dresses, 1 maxi skirt, 7 tank tops, 4 shirts, 3 camisoles, 3 pajama sets, 15 undies, 6 pairs of socks, and 4 pairs of shoes. But why are you still reading?? Go buy these cubes!\" \u2014 Tiffany Get a set of five from Amazon for $21.99 (available in 14 colors). 8. And a shoe bag capable of holding up to three pairs of footwear. Think of how much less clunky it'll be to place this compact cube in your luggage than have to make space for three separate pairs of shoes. Don't even get me started on sand or dirt from the bottom of your shoes getting over all of your other belongings!!! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"You can totally fit three pairs of shoes in this! (Size 6.5 female shoe, fit heels, wedges, and sandals.) I bought two and will absolutely be buying more for my husband. 10/10 would recommend! I travel frequently, and I always overpack; this helped cut down space and stress immensely! \" \u2014 Taylor Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in seven colors and patterns). 9. A genius airplane window tray (if you're a window seat kind of traveler) that you can use to hold your drinks, headphones, etc. if you hate keeping the seat back tray down or want to use it for something else like setting up your laptop and playing The Sims 4 . Amazon, www.amazon.com PS: This only works if you have full access to the window (rather than those seats where you get the weird halves of two windows between the rows in front and behind you). Promising review: \"A friend recommended this to me as a vital travel companion now that I've returned to frequent flying. I initially thought of it as a novelty, but now that I've used it, it's a necessity. It keeps the workspace clear for my laptop, but it also organizes all the little pieces that can become so annoying to keep up with \u2014 glasses, earphones, etc. It got my seatmate's immediate attention, as well as a few other folks nearby. I suspect they'll have one soon. Watch for one soon in a window near you!\" \u2014 Timothy G. Wolfe Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . 10. A universal travel adapter you're gonna be grateful for if your travels involve hopping to various countries that all use different outlets. Now, you won't need to buy and pack different adapters for each country you plan on visiting. Phew! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com The charger can be used in Mexico, Canada, the UK, the UAE, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, and countries in Europe, Asia, and South America. Promising review: \"LOVE this adapter! I travel from time to time internationally and have always used just the 'standard' adapters found in airports. Could not pass up the opportunity to purchase this one after reading the reviews. Exceeded my expectations of what it was capable of. I used it on a recent trip to Germany, and it handled everything needed \u2014 laptop, cellphone (USB ports are so very welcome), alarm clock, dryer, etc. Did not miss a beat on the power provided. And it is also attractive looking ;-) Thank you for making such a great, dependable product!\" \u2014 Monkey Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . 11. A phone mount so you can watch your favorite downloaded shows/movies on your flight \u2014 because sometimes the airline doesn't offer your comfort characters on their entertainment menu or worse...there's no television at all. Amazon Promising review: \"If you travel a lot, buy this!! Even if you don't travel, this phone holder would be useful. My hubby and I fly fairly often, and I'm always tired of holding my phone or figuring out how to set it up during plane rides. This is a game changer for flights. Makes it so easy and convenient to watch movies or shows during trips. A few people even asked me where I got it from. Definitely recommend!\" \u2014 Alex Norman Get it from Amazon for $13.97+ (available in five colors and packs of two). 12. A super smart reusable bottle bag to help protect wine, perfume, olive oil, and more in your checked bag. Whether you're bringing back a souvenir for a loved one or going on a cruise where you can bring on a bottle of your favorite vino, this will def come in handy! Amazon JetBag is a small business specializing in creating bags to protect your wine and your stuff. It's designed with absorbent padding on the inside, so in the event that the bottle breaks, it won't get everywhere in your luggage. Promising review: \"Bought to bring wine from France home from vacation. We bought three bottles (one of which was champagne). All three made it on the Eurostar and two flights in perfect condition.\" \u2014 Katie Get a set of three from Amazon for $13.99 (available in four colors). 13. A pair of compression socks for potentially bringing sweet relief to feet that tend to swell during air travel. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Read more about compression socks and swelling on long flights at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"Game changer. I bought these to wear on the plane. Usually, when I fly, my ankles are swollen for days. These socks kept swelling to a minimum. So glad I bought them.\" \u2014 MeganLucey Get them from Amazon for $14.24+ (available in unisex sizes S\u2013XXL and 13 styles). Check out my colleague's Physix Gear compression socks review for more deets! 14. A portable door lock that'll provide some extra security and peace of mind in hotel rooms, hostels, and Airbnbs. www.amazon.com , Amazon Just be aware that this may get flagged if you bring it through security, so it's best to bring this in a checked bag! Promising review: \"I went on a solo trip to Europe and Africa and used the door lock to boost security. The lock fits and secures the lock. It's very easy to use. I would just suggest you watch the video and practice at home before your holiday.\" \u2014 Jaye Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (also available in a two- and four-pack) 15. A seat-back organizer if the thought of putting your personal belongings like glasses, drinking bottles, and tech items into the provided seat-back pouch makes you squirm. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Definitely my new favorite purchase to make flying easier. Very easy to slip over the tray table, with lots of pockets to keep things organized and at your fingertips. Material is stretchy but not thin, folds up very small, and can be stored in your backpack, purse, or briefcase without taking up a lot of space!! Great product to keep things handy mid-flight, and you don't have to use that icky seat back pocket anymore!!\" \u2014 Shirley Kinyon Check out BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord \u2019s Airplane Pockets review for more deets! Get it from Amazon for $29.99 . 16. A belt bag for a small but mighty solution to carrying around your essentials on your vacay excursions. You won't have to lug around heavy tote bags (or put any strain on your shoulders, for that matter) thanks to its compact size, but it's just big enough to keep your wallet, phone, room key, sunnies, medications, and a snack right in front of ya for easy access. Elizabeth Lilly / BuzzFeed, Amazon BuzzFeed editor and frequent traveler Elizabeth Lilly has one and loves it. \"I wear a size L/XL in clothing, and sometimes waist bags just don't work out so well for me. With this one, I can confirm that it fits around my waist comfortably without outerwear, across my chest without outerwear, *and* over a thick coat and several layers. The pockets inside are so handy, and I even had room to spare throughout my Iceland trip. This was the only purse I brought for the whole trip, and it performed its job flawlessly. Just make sure that you zip the zipper ALL the way because the zipper goes down pretty far on the sides for easier access to contents. Having my hands free was wildly convenient for a number of reasons, including crawling around inside of an ice cave and putting out my hands for some extra balance while walking on sheets of ice along cliffs. Oh, and it comes in so so SO many colors.\" Promising review: \"Bought this for a trip to Europe, and it was perfect. Wore as a crossbody. It was comfortable and held a lot of things, plus my iPhone Pro Max fit with no problem.\" \u2014 Maine Get it from Amazon for $12.98 (available in 38 styles). 17. A stroller that *actually* folds up small enough to fit as a carry-on in the plane's overhead compartments. Let's be real: You and your kiddo, who has been screaming their head off since takeoff, do NOT wanna wait to retrieve a checked stroller, and now you won't have to. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Fun fact: This stroller was awarded a Guinness World Record in 2014 for the most compact stroller! It weighs 9.5 pounds and has a weight limit of 55 pounds. Promising review: \"This is 100% the most crucial item that we took on our three-week trip to Europe with our 2-year-old. The wheels lock to maneuver uneven surfaces, and it\u2019s super lightweight. Buy a backpack-style bag for it. You can also buy a cup holder attachment. Being able to put it in the overhead compartment on the plane was a game changer. No more waiting at the gate for a checked stroller or, worse, having it sent with your luggage. Takes just a little practice folding up, and sometimes a little elbow grease, but put your weight into it, and you\u2019ll get it.\" \u2014 Kesley Get it from Amazon for $139.99+ (available in three styles and colors). 18. An AirFly Pro wireless transmitter so you can connect your wireless earbuds to the airplane entertainment system. Watching your favorite shows/movies with clear sound is a heck of a lot better than the static that comes with the junk headphones the airline tries to sell you. www.amazon.com It also comes with a USB-C charging cable, travel pouch, keychain holder, quick-start guide, and a manual. My colleague Chelsea Stuart used it on a European trip \u2014 check out her Twelve South AirFly Pro review . Twelve South is a small business that has been creating innovative tech accessories since 2009. Promising review: \"I loved being able to move around in my seat, eat, and stretch and not get bothered by a cord from my Bluetooth headphones to the video screen on the airplane. It's a game changer for sure. The battery lasted from Accra, Ghana, all the way to Texas in the US \u2014 18+ hours in the air! Buying a second one for my son for our next flight!\" \u2014 Stephanie Schmidt Get it from Amazon for $28.99+ (available in four styles and three colors). 19. A pet backpack with wheels to make getting through the airport with your tiny BFF a more seamless experience. Not to mention, thanks to the compact size, it'll fit comfortably underneath the seat in front of you once you get on the plane, and the mesh window will allow you and the little fluffer to keep an eye on one another. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com The medium size fits pets weighing up to 10 pounds, and the large fits pets weighing up to 18 pounds. That said, some reviewers mentioned that the large size works perfectly well for their 20-plus-pound dogs. It can be wheeled using the telescoping handle, held using the strap, or worn as a backpack. Promising review: \"First time flying with my dog. I bought a large one. He is a 21-pound Cavalier King Charles spaniel. He was able to sit and lie comfortably in the carrier. When on the plane, remove the hard-back bottom to fit beneath the seat. It is easily removable and reattached. I got a window seat, which allowed me to wedge the bottom at the edge of my seat/arm rail when detached.\" \u2014 Karen Get it from Amazon for $69.95 (available in two sizes and three colors). 20. A travel shawl that can be used as a light blanket to cozy up with on your flight, a scarf, and it can even come in handy if you'll be visiting tourist sites with a covered shoulders dress code in place (like European cathedrals). www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love this wrap!! It is the perfect weight and size for travel. It didn't leave my side on an 11-day backpack trip through Europe and was used as a scarf, blanket, towel, and wrap all through the trip. Fashionable enough to dress up a basic travel day outfit, warm enough to keep away a chill on a cooler night, and light enough to pack away small into a bag or tie around a purse strap. I can't say enough great things! I am buying these as gifts for everyone I know who travels.\" \u2014 Jenn Get it from Amazon for $46+ (available in nine colors). 21. An ultra-supportive neck pillow to make the whole \"falling asleep while sitting upright\" thing possible (and comfy). Is there any better way to pass the time on a plane, train, or roadtrip than with a nice long nap? I don't think so. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I am a terrible flyer who recently took the red-eye from Dubai to Chicago (15 hours). The Trtl Pillow was a mini lifesaver! I was able to comfortably rest my head on the support and felt warm enough to actually doze off...a rare accomplishment for this skittish flyer. The Velcro works wonderfully with regard to adjustment, and I liked wrapping the fabric around my mouth and nose. Sort of felt cozy...even if I did look like a ninja in a neck brace! Overall, this product has changed the way that I fly, and I am so thankful for this invention and the opportunity to support a small company with big ideas.\" \u2014 S.Viruly Get it from Amazon for $64.99+ (available in two colors and a breathable style). 22. A foldable jewelry organizer that'll take up less space in your bag than a clunky jewelry box AND also serves as a better method than just tossing your jewelry into your bag and having to untangle it once you reach your destination. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I would give this more stars if I could. It's exactly what I've been looking for forever!!! It has plenty of room for my clunky jewelry and enough separate pouches that things don't get tangled. I LOVE it.\" \u2014 Carrie Minturn Get it from Amazon for $12.59+ (available in two colors). 23. A carry-on case designed to comfortably fit under your seat. Sure, you might be lucky enough to have plenty of room in the overhead bin, but there's just something really humbling about having to fight your way out of your row and into the aisle just for everyone behind you to watch you have a wrestling match with your carry-on. We're leaving those days behind thanks to this genius invention. www.amazon.com Promising review : \"This works out so well for me. I\u2019m a flight attendant, and I\u2019ve had an infinite amount of day trips over the summer. I got tired of carrying around my regular TravelPro spinner, so I finally ordered this. SOOOOO MUCH BETTER FOR ME. It\u2019s light, has enough pockets, and can easily fit under a seat if needed. The ONLY picky thing I can think of is how loud it sounds going across rough concrete. The wheels aren\u2019t as silent as others, but that won\u2019t stop me from buying another in the future.\" \u2014 Kayla T. Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in four colors). 24. A compact pill organizer complete with six compartments for keeping your medications separate and preventing you from having to pack multiple pill containers. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"My husband and I travel a lot and take a number of prescription drugs. It was always a hassle accessing our medication when needed, so I purchased this organizer to make things easier. I used a label maker and labeled each little compartment and it has performed wonderfully. I highly recommend this organizer to anyone who travels and needs medications throughout the day.\" \u2014 Jacqueline Get a three-pack from Amazon for $8.47+ (available in two color combos). 25. An inflatable footrest for making your next flight the comfiest one yet. So comfy, you might actually somewhat *enjoy* flying. PS \u2014 if you're traveling with kiddos, this can help turn their airplane seat into a bed. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This footrest pillow is essential for those who travel very long distances. It is not only uncomfortable but unhealthy to leave feet dangling down for many hours or days at a time while traveling. I purchased this pillow to situate between my airplane seat and the seat in front of mine. It is wonderful to be able to prop my feet up, with bent knees, while watching movies or sleeping. I regularly fly the same route that is about 30 hours (including layovers), and when I am unable to get a seat upfront, this footrest pillow keeps me more comfortable at the back of the plane .\" \u2014 Yvonne N Get it from Amazon for $21.24+ (available in four colors). 26. A pack of foldable hangers because the five hangers (if that?!) the hotel provides just isn't enough. You shouldn't have to risk getting your favorite blouse all wrinkled up because all the hangers are already being used to hold the dresses you brought. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"On a trip to Europe, I used these hangers to hang my laundry to dry. I even hung a pair of wet jeans (through the belt loops). I thought the hanger would break, but it held up fine! Hotels never supply enough hangers, so I will be bringing these along when I travel.\" \u2014 debi Get a pack of 12 from Amazon for $8.99 . 27. An anti-blister balm to apply before putting on your shoes so you can prevent those painful annoyances from even trying to happen. Whether you're walking miles at a cruise excursion or dashing from tourist attraction to tourist attraction, your feet will be happy you prepped them ahead of time. www.amazon.com This is made of allergen-free, plant-derived ingredients and infused with vitamins A and C! Promising review: \"I don't normally have trouble with blisters or pain from my work shoes, but I travel regularly to Washington, DC, for work. I walk a lot while I'm there, including when it's hot and muggy in the summer, and any kind of shoe I've tried gives me blisters when I walk five miles a day with extremely sweaty feet and no socks. I thought my only options were to coat my feet in Band-Aids or bite the bullet and start wearing tights or socks in the heat, but then I found this stuff. I just got back from a week in DC in shoes that have given me blisters before, and my feet are completely fine.

Seth Matlins is the Managing Director of the Forbes CMO Network. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 06:30am EDT Updated Apr 15, 2025, 06:38am EDT Share Save For The Entrepreneurial Chief Marketing Officer, Challenging Norms Is the New Norm. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Uncertainty Index, 6 weeks ago, measures of global uncertainty reached their third highest level since monthly tracking began in 2008 , behind only that year\u2019s global economic turmoil and the pandemic. And as any behavioral scientist\u2014or anyone with common sense for that matter\u2014knows, uncertainty clouds and complicates decision making processes and thus the path to purchase and is something other than the optimal macro-context for marketing or marketers. But so it is, and so it makes the need for chief marketers to challenge norms, thinking and doing entrepreneurially and differently, ever more important. What then makes for an entrepreneurial CMO? At Forbes , and as we have for the four years since we created this recognition, we consider the entrepreneurial CMO one who approaches driving growth neither beholden to the status quo nor to disrupting it for the sake of same. We believe the entrepreneurial CMO understands both what has enduring value and what needs to change, whether within their organizations and/or in how they go to market. They are strategic risk-takers, learning and optimizing based on both what works and, inevitably, what doesn\u2019t, believing that failures aren\u2019t failures if you learn from and get better because of them. They see opportunity in constraints and are relentlessly focused on making and doing more with less, no matter how much they might have. Their entrepreneurial approach to marketing challenges assumptions and what\u2019s come and been done before. It\u2019s a mindset that informs their strategies, and evidence of it is often seen through tactical application and activation, the in-market expression of mindset and approach. So too do we recognize the difference between being a great CMO and a great and entrepreneurial one. Not everyone is both and not everyone who is, is both at the same time. A great CMO focuses on what matters most, on what creates and captures demand, and on how to best allocate limited resources to unlimited opportunities. They eschew the rest as distraction and think about the business and their role in driving it strategically and then execute creatively. However, we consider this to be as fundamental as it is essential, and not in and of itself evidence of an entrepreneurial approach. We also recognize that the \u201centrepreneurial\u201d must be considered within the specific context of different industries, categories, companies, and markets. Because that which may be business as usual for company X might be an entirely new way of thinking and doing for company Y, and our judging and selection of the fifty CMOs recognized on this year\u2019s list makes efforts to account for this. It\u2019s our conviction that a status-quo approach to marketing is an increasingly challenged one. It\u2019s our belief that an entrepreneurial take on driving growth and on the art, science, and practice of marketing is and will be increasingly important to great\u2014even good\u2014CMOs, as there is no current reason to think these times of radical uncertainty will become anything but more so in the near-future. As reminder, this particular Forbes list is a one-and-done list, which is to say that once someone has appeared on it, they are no longer eligible for it. This year\u2019s cohort represents the most geographically diverse one yet, and as you read through it (presented alphabetically), you\u2019ll find evidence of an entrepreneurial marketing approach from leaders stewarding brands and companies across categories and the globe. Each is a chief marketer\u2014regardless of their titles\u2014who has been selected from among hundreds of nominees, based on open-nominations, and judged by qualitative consideration from amongst their peers, marketing industry and agency leaders, executive recruiters, CMO list alumni, and Forbes, by whom all final decisions were made. Regardless of what and where they market, it\u2019s how they market and compete that finds them recognized on this 4 th annual Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 list. As in year\u2019s past, we think you\u2019ll find something to learn from each and all of those recognized and invite you to get to know them below. 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 Additional writing and reporting by Laura Ratliffe. Some quotes have been lightly edited for clarity and/or brevity. A-C tk Benji Baer CMO, CBRE FOLLOW Because despite a fundamental, global reset for commercial real estate driven by economic uncertainty, office-norm disruptions, and the continued evolution towards a post-pandemic new normal, Baer\u2019s marketing embraces the disruption that comes from \u201cbreaking models.\u201d Knowing that the times and category require reinvention, Baer and her team have reimagined CBRE\u2019s brand and client experience, marketing\u2019s mission, structure, capabilities, and audiences, and, as she told Forbes , \u201cbuilt a level of accountability the business had not previously experienced.\u201d During her tenure as CMO of the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate services firm, Baer and her team have challenged outdated paradigms and models. At a time when businesses and policymakers are reevaluating how cities function, Baer and her team created the firm\u2019s Shaping Tomorrow\u2019s Cities initiative, positioning CBRE as more than a services provider by urging industry leaders to rethink economic, demographic, and infrastructure challenges. \u201c[Marketing] stepped up to be the ultimate convener, giving a voice\u2014and a platform\u2014to these consequential themes,\u201d Baer tells Forbes . Since its launch, this program alone has doubled the firm\u2019s client engagement. In Q4 2024, CBRE\u2019s reported revenues increased 16% year-over-year (YoY). Linda Bethea Linda Bethea CMO, Danone North America FOLLOW Because Bethea\u2019s focus on \u201cchampioning unorthodox ways of doing things\u201d ensures the company\u2019s marketing remains agile and continually \u201ctweaked\u201d based on performance. With the company since 2020, Bethea has found new ways to solve problems and meet unmet consumer needs with what she describes as a \u201ctest and learn\u201d approach. To these ends, Bethea and her team work to create a culture of learning and risk-taking, embracing what inevitable failures can teach, \u201ccurating a wall of \u2018fame & shame\u2019 highlighting both our successes and failures to help our team become more comfortable with risk-taking.\u201d Examples of Bethea\u2019s unorthodox and entrepreneurial approach include launching ST\u014dK, a \u201cbold\u201d cold-brew brand\u2014not just in partnership with Wrexham AFC but by \u201csponsoring a stadium in a country where the product isn\u2019t sold?\u201d As she asked Forbes , \u201cwhat is bolder than that?\u201d Facing budget declines of 70% for International Delight, a $1B+ portfolio brand, Bethea and her team took an insight\u201475% of 18-24-year-olds watch at least one hour of reality TV weekly\u2014and created a TikTok reality show, Cr\u00e9me House , to drive engagement and growth. In the last quarter reported, Danone saw an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.8% across its North American market. Benjamin Braun Benjamin Braun CMO, Samsung Europe FOLLOW Because Braun markets with the conviction that scale isn\u2019t incompatible with agility and that \u201ceven if you work for a massive global conglomerate like Samsung you operate as a start-up team.\u201d With a remit including oversight of the company\u2019s marketing across 44 countries, Braun tells Forbes that you can\u2019t \u201callow yourself to become complacent and slow. You think big and figure out how to deliver without a budget or people. Change,\u201d he says, \u201cis driven by people with ideas. Not budgets.\u201d For Braun, marketing isn\u2019t just about storytelling\u2014it\u2019s about proving real business results because, and as he says, \u201conly then will we gain credibility.\u201d Illustrations of this and his entrepreneurial approach are seen in the brand\u2019s activation at the Paris Olympics. Rather than spending millions on advertising, Braun and his team went guerrilla\u2014gifting 17,000 Samsung foldable phones to Olympians and Paralympians, requesting only that they unpack them on social media. This led to \u201cVictory Selfies\u201d on Olympic podiums, massive global exposure at a fraction of the cost, and a 23% sales increase. International online research data and analytics firm YouGov recently named Samsung the #1 Best Global Brand for 2025. Heidi Browning Heidi Browning Senior EVP and Chief Marketing Officer, National Hockey League FOLLOW Because as sports\u2019 traditional broadcast model evolves to a multi-platform and direct-to-consumer one, Browning markets knowing engaging the next generation of fans requires a transformation in skills and approach. Equating the entrepreneurial mindset driving the league\u2019s marketing to the \u201ccowboy ethos\u201d she learned growing up in Montana, Browning tells Forbes , this cowboy spirit creates the \u201cfearless pursuit of new frontiers, question(ing) everything; both why and why not; and being comfortable with the unknown.\u201d To ensure the NHL\u2019s continued growth, Browning and her team apply the lessons of start-up culture to invite new fans and revenues into the sport and league. Examples include creating the Power Players Youth Advisory Board, embedding Gen Z perspectives directly into marketing decisions to ensure future generation relevance, launching an original content docuseries, \u201c Face-Off: Inside the NHL,\u201d with Amazon Studios among others, and which succeeded in driving both upper and lower funnel growth metrics. The NHL saw record-breaking business performance in 2023-24, with revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year increase, and total attendance hitting an all-time high of 22.9 million. Jason Bunge Jason Bunge CMO, Hasbro FOLLOW Because when Bunge joined the 102-year-old toy category icon as its first CMO in 2023, \u201cthere was,\u201d as he told Forbes , \u201cthe opportunity and need to build an entirely new marketing organization; construct a new set of marketing capabilities to snap to the company\u2019s evolving business portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, redefine the role of marketing for the different needs of each business.\u201d The former Riot Games CMO and his team approach driving growth recognizing the challenges and opportunities for the company\u2019s principal business lines (toys, physical games and digital/video games) \u201care bespoke, and the marketing organization must be able to demonstrate agility, efficiency and scale in how it addresses each.\u201d To these ends, Bunge carved out 5% of their budget \u201cfor a first-of-its-kind company test-and-learn agenda,\u201d in order \u201cto inject a new mindset of \u2018roles of brands\u2019, (because) not everything was going to grow and not everything needed the same type or amount of marketing.\u201d This approach drove insights allowing Bunge and his team to understand where resources would have the greatest impact and return. As Bunge shared, \u201chaving an entrepreneurial mindset sometimes means breaking old habits and fighting hard to create space and oxygen for new approaches.\u201d Emma Chalwin Emma Chalwin CMO, Workday FOLLOW Because as she leads all marketing globally for this enterprise software company, Chalwin is intent on driving growth by \u201cbreaking the B2B mold.\u201d As Chalwin and her team disrupt Workday\u2019s traditional marketing and ensure it is anything but category-typical, she never loses sight of the fact that, as she told Forbes , \u201cwe\u2019re not just selling to a business; we\u2019re selling to the people who work there.\u201d This human-centric approach to enterprise marketing is driven by a mindset rooted in what she describes as rule-breaking, risk-taking and acting like \u201can entrepreneur inside a Fortune 500 company.\u201d Believing that challenging the status quo of B2B marketing requires a sense of humor and resolve, she and her team launched the Rock Star 2.0 campaign, bringing an \u201cunexpected irreverence\u201d that challenged conceptions about who the rock stars of business are. Chalwin tells Forbes the campaign increased web traffic by over 50% and lead-to-sales conversions by 17%. She\u2019s also working to train 20,000 employees as brand ambassadors to ensure everyone can share a consistent and compelling brand story. Workday\u2019s FY25 revenues increased 16.4% YoY. Kim Chappell Kim Chappell Chief Brand Officer, Bobbie FOLLOW Because in order to compete against industry Goliaths, Chappell is helping build this infant formula company into more than just a business and is reshaping conversations and expectations about modern parenting. For Chappell, being an entrepreneurial marketer isn\u2019t just a mindset\u2014it\u2019s a muscle. As she told Forbes , \u201cyou have to train yourself to move in the moment without hesitation\u2014with limited resources and often without a blueprint for success. If you don\u2019t go do the work, it\u2019s just another idea, what-if, or magic moment lost.\u201d One example of Chappell\u2019s approach to advancing the conversations driving Bobbie\u2019s growth, is when a Times Square billboard featuring culinary influencer Molly Baz, pregnant, in underwear, and holding lactation cookies over her breasts was removed for violating the billboard owner\u2019s guidelines, Chappell and her team saw opportunity and moved to both seize and make the moment. In only two weeks, Bobbie had Baz back on a Times Square billboard, this time breastfeeding her newborn\u2014a cultural first\u2014and apt illustration of Chappell\u2019s entrepreneurial conviction that \u201cnot everything needs a quarter of planning to be on brand, bold and successful.\u201d Chappell tells Forbes that over the past year, Bobbie has become the fastest-growing brand in its category. Daniel Cherry III Daniel Cherry III SVP & General Manager, adidas FOLLOW Because for Cherry, entrepreneurial marketing is about \u201calways being in beta, and instead of fearing failure embracing it as critical feedback pushing ideas one step closer to thrilling the consumer.\u201d As Cherry helped lead the brand through the very public early-end of its controversial partnership with Kanye West his perspective on failure as feedback would make the difference. \u201cWe suffered a crisis of confidence and almost believed the hype,\u201d he told Forbes . But rather than replacing the void left by the end of that partnership with another, Cherry thought and did differently, turning to adidas\u2019 greatest asset\u2014its archive\u2014and creating \u201cOriginals LA.\u201d Intended as a new business unit not just a marketing approach, Cherry\u2019s idea for moving the business forward looked backwards. By tapping the brand\u2019s archives, Cherry and his team helped put adidas back at the center of sneaker culture, as evidenced by the near ubiquity of Sambas and Gazelles over the past year. Cherry also built forward, championing new collaborations blending nostalgia with modernity, launching initiatives like the adidas Foundation, and restructuring creative workflows to give designers greater autonomy. For the quarter ending December 2024, company revenues had increased nearly 24% YoY. Kristyn Cook Kristyn Cook EVP and Chief Agency, Sales & Marketing Officer, State Farm FOLLOW Because in the crowded and complex insurance market, Cook leads marketing for this category leader with a conviction that it\u2019s only by \u201ctaking the right calculated risks where you have opportunity to win big.\u201d Importantly though, the work Cook leads proves entrepreneurial marketing doesn\u2019t always mean chasing reinvention for reinvention\u2019s sake, Cook and her team are amplifying State Farm\u2019s most powerful assets\u2014its signature red, iconic jingle, and, of course, Jake from State Farm\u2014by positioning them in high-profile, real-world moments that matter. \u201cOur goal is to stay nimble so we can jump in on trending cultural moments,\u201d Cook told Forbes . As examples, the brand has been a first-mover in the category in Gaming, and when Donna Kelce became a cultural focal point, State Farm took advantage of the moment by placing Jake next to her at a game, amplifying brand I.P. and creating a clutter-breaking moment for the brand. A 25-year company veteran, Cook oversees both marketing and sales. And in support of the 18,000 agents in its network, she and her team \u201calways strive to be \u2018market movers\u2019 in any space in which we play.\u201d Phil Cook Phil Cook CMO, WNBA FOLLOW Because during an explosion in interest from fans and partners alike, Cook, the league\u2019s first CMO, is ensuring the WNBA isn\u2019t just riding a wave of growth but actively driving it. Cook and his team are creating a new marketing playbook for the WNBA and its rising stars, during a time of unprecedented attention on women\u2019s basketball. While most leagues pay little attention to their players\u2019 pasts once drafted,Cook and his team took a different strategic approach with their \u201cWelcome to the W\u201d campaign, as college stars including Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink segued from the NCAA to the WNBA. In leading efforts to bridge the players\u2019 college and pro journeys, the campaign leaned heavily into the players\u2019 college pasts, creating a narrative continuity helping grow the league\u2019s fan-base on the players\u2019 existing ones. This, as well as a differentiated commitment to social impact, a heightened focus on dimensionalizing player narratives, and creating a 24/7 content hub for the league amongst other efforts, are driving unprecedented numbers for the WNBA. Last year witnessed the largest rights deal in the league\u2019s history, an aggregated $2.2B across ESPN, Amazon and NBCUniversal; sponsorship revenue and demand exploded, as attendance increased 48% and sellout games 242% YoY. Stefano Curti Stefano Curti Chief Brands Officer, Coty FOLLOW Because with a determination to \u201cmake a large company small again,\u201d Curti is ensuring leaner teams and faster decision-making help transform Coty into a nimbler player across the global beauty category. As the leader of a transformation that\u2019s revitalized brand icons like CoverGirl and Rimmel, Curti\u2019s entrepreneurial approach is rooted in speed and connection. In order to mirror the approach of smaller and niche-beauty players, and nurture the brands\u2019 internal \u201ccool factor,\u201d he and his team created an internal incubator, Agile Beauty, which operates like a startup within Coty. Since its inception, the incubator has developed trend-driven products in just eight months, an industry-best for a global beauty powerhouse. To these same ends, Curti and his team have built new advocacy and community programs, engaging influencers and beauty creators not only to amplify storytelling but to co-develop products. With a remit spanning Europe, North America, and high-growth markets like India, Latin America, and the Middle East, Curti and his team are expanding Coty\u2019s global footprint while leveraging its dominance in prestige fragrance\u2014a category he calls \u201cthe skincare of the mind\u201d\u2014to drive future innovation and consumer engagement. Coty reported 10% net revenue growth in 2024, outpacing the 9% global beauty market increase. D-K Carmen DeRosas Carmen DeRosas EVP, Head of Marketing, Rakbank FOLLOW Because by challenging status quo and conventional industry norms, DeRosas is redefining what marketing is in the UAE\u2019s financial services category, and helping lead the transformation of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. Since arriving at Rakbank, DeRosas tells Forbes she has \u201cimplemented a culture of continuous experimentation\u2026that continues to challenge and improve our models,\u201d evidence of which can be seen in a near 60% reduction in agency costs and 50% increase in asset turnaround times during her tenure. Ensuring that marketing is a driver of the company\u2019s innovation and transformation, has DeRosas and her team embracing a challenger brand ethos and shifting mindsets \u201cfrom fear to exploration,\u201d which she credits with helping drive \u201cthe step change we have created across all marketing disciplines, from transforming the way we show up, reshaping agency partnerships, launching campaigns that have elevated brand perception and performance, to delivering a 4x uplift in digital acquisition.\u201d With industry expertise honed during time at PayPal and American Express, DeRosas\u2019s remit includes overseeing the Rakbank brand, its insurance technology platform Protego, and family finance app Skiply. Since getting to Rakbank, DeRosas and her team have driven a major shift in marketing\u2019s role at the bank\u2014and their enhanced brand focus has contributed to a 13-point increase in employee engagement, reinforcing her belief that a strong, people-first culture is key to sustained innovation and growth. Rakbank had record-breaking financial performance last year, and a 16.4% increase in net profits YoY. Carole Diarra Carole Diarra Global Vice President of Marketing, UGG FOLLOW Because the \u201cvision to see beyond traditional strategies and the agility to act on them in ways that drive real impact\u201d is helping Diarra fuel the iconic brand\u2019s transformation from its comfort-first origins to a broader fashion and lifestyle business. With a global remit, Diara and her team are redefining what UGG is, where it shows up, and how it connects with its audience. Under her marketing leadership, they\u2019re doing this by focusing on a combination of \u201cagile media thinking\u201d that is inverting status-quo channel approaches, a media-mix strategy shift to social-first, real-time creative decision making, and liberating their marketing from the category\u2019s traditional seasonal emphasis. An illustration of the latter and Diarra\u2019s enhanced emphasis on consumer-led innovation is the brand\u2019s \u201cUGG Season\u201d platform which, as Diarra shared with Forbes , \u201cdidn\u2019t start from us but from our community (including Cardi B)...we didn\u2019t create the movement; we recognized and amplified it, letting culture lead our strategy.\u201d This entrepreneurial approach, one untethered to the past, is also evident in UGG\u2019s unexpected collaborations with Paris Fashion Week, and fashion-forward brands including Sacai and Telfar. A core part of the Deckers\u2019 portfolio, for Q3FY25, the UGG brand reported +16.1% increase in net sales YoY. Cristina Diezhandino Cristina Diezhandino CMO, Diageo FOLLOW Because Diezhandino\u2019s marketing for Diageo\u2019s 200 brands is rooted in a \u201cmindset of possibility\u201d and an approach that she told Forbes , values \u201dprogress over perfection. It\u2019s okay to fail as long as we learn.\u201d Despite category headwinds created by a changing world and consumer attitudes and behaviors, Diezhandino realizes that what doesn\u2019t change is the need to stay \u201ccentered around celebrations, culture and memorable moments\u201d and that this in turn requires her marketing organization to \u201cunderstand\u2014and shape the future of\u2014socializing better than anyone else.\u201d To these ends, Diezhandino and her team have built a marketing organization thriving on \u201cconnected decisioning,\u201d curiosity, agility, experimentation, reorganizing marketing into \u201cagile brand communities\u201d which allows them to better turn insight into action. To accelerate the growth of $100+ (USD) brands, Diezhandino created the Diageo Luxury Group, uniting its luxury portfolio. To ensure her organization has the tools to act fast in evolving markets, Diezhandino spearheaded initiatives including a Virtual Studio \u201crevolutionizing how we create content\u201d, a global partnerships lab, and Diageo\u2019s largest consumer data initiative. With responsibility for marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the global portfolio, Diezhandino is thinking and doing differently to ensure Diageo\u2019s place in socializing\u2019s future. Brian Donnelly Brian Donnelly EVP, GM and Chief Commercial Officer, Ancestry FOLLOW Because Donnelly understands that \u201cspeed is a competitive advantage\u201d and, as he tells Forbes , while \u201cthere\u2019s a comfort in the \u2018tried and true,\u2019 challenging norms, experimenting fearlessly, and pivoting quickly, allows us to adapt and refine strategies in real-time.\u201d With P&L accountability for the 40-year-old genealogy brand\u2019s global business operations, Donnelly\u2019s remit includes oversight of marketing, growth, and business development across the 130 countries where they do business. Intent on \u201cinspiring a culture of innovation across the business\u201d Donnelly and his team identified a growth opportunity, creating a new market by leveraging their genetic testing expertise and applying it to the pet category for the first time. Focused on driving growth by marketing and raising awareness \u201cof the emotional, cultural and personal benefits that come from discovering your roots,\u201d Donnelly and his team are pushing boundaries and experimenting with the new as they reshape Ancestry\u2019s brand, commerce, and customer engagement. Donnelly reports that brand health metrics are rising and that, in 2024, the company saw double-digit growth in DNA kit sales. As of May 1, Donnelly will become the Chief Commercial Officer at Myriad Genetics. Bene\u0301 Eaton Ben\u00e9 Eaton CMO, Figs FOLLOW Because in leading marketing globally for this DTC healthcare brand, Eaton\u2019s entrepreneurial approach balances boldness and precision, and as she told Forbes , \u201cisn\u2019t just about disrupting\u2014but about building something meaningful and enduring.\u201d With a remit spanning 34 countries, Eaton and her team lean into the company\u2019s entrepreneurial DNA to fuel their own. For Eaton, entrepreneurial marketing \u201cisn\u2019t just about growth (but) about redefining how a brand can impact people, culture and the world.\u201d To these ends, and as one example, Eaton and her team led Figs to become Team USA\u2019s official Medical Team Outfitter, creating a global stage and moment celebrating the community in a never-been-done-before way. She says the effort drove \u201csignificant incremental revenue...but more than the numbers, this campaign redefined how healthcare professionals are perceived.\u201d The LA fires, which devastated the company\u2019s hometown, provide further illustration as Eaton and her team mobilized to quickly support over 1,500 displaced healthcare professionals. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a crisis response\u2014but testament to our entrepreneurial mindset: acting with urgency, empathy, and impact to show up for our community in moments that matter most.\u201d Colin Fleming Colin Fleming CMO, ServiceNow FOLLOW Because with a \u201cstubborn intolerance of mediocrity,\u201d Fleming focuses, as he tells Forbes on \u201cwhat could be, and refusing to be discouraged by the status quo.\u201d Insistent that \u201cnone of the Bs in \u2018B2B\u2019 should stand for boring,\u201d Fleming and his team are proving that bold storytelling, culture-shaping campaigns, and a strong point of view will drive growth regardless of sector. With a remit leading ServiceNow\u2019s end-to-end global marketing, planning and operations, Fleming has evolved company strategy from product-led to brand-led. As he and his team seek \u201cexponential thinking and big, bold ideas that break the mold,\u201d they\u2019ve rolled out the company\u2019s most comprehensive global campaign ever, high-profile and perception shifting partnerships, and \u201cProject Marie Kondo,\u201d which led to cutting 50% of their content creation to ensure focus on what \u201csparks joy\u201d for customers. \u201cThis simplification\u201d he told us, \u201cfrees our teams to concentrate on impact and alignment rather than volume.\u201d For the 12 months ending as of the date of this writing, Service Now\u2019s market capitalization was up 22%. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in ServiceNow.) Adrian Fung Adrian Fung Global CMO, eBay FOLLOW Because Fung brings a \u201cfounder\u2019s mentality\u201d to the iconic ecommerce brand, focusing, as he told Forbes , on \u201ctreating every dollar like it\u2019s your own, and finding scrappy ways to leverage existing assets, customers, partners.\u201d For Fung, a global remit for marketing a brand and multi-category business like eBay\u2019s, with some 130 million customers and over 2.1 billion listings, requires an approach he defines as \u201clearning fast rather than failing fast.\u201d And in order to leverage learnings to drive innovation at scale, Fung recognizes the need \u201cto balance speed and agility with the complexity and scale of eBay\u2019s (business). To do this, we identify small but high leverage opportunities that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to optimize impact.\u201d One example: An initially small-scale test with Facebook Marketplace in Germany which enabled buyers to browse eBay listings directly on Marketplace, rolled out internationally. Recognizing \u201cthis type of innovation can\u2019t be achieved from marketing alone - and requires an end-to-end approach\u201d finds Fung breaking down silos and challenging how problems are solved across the business. As of this writing, eBay\u2019s stock was up over 58% YoY. Arielle Gross Samuels Arielle Gross Samuels Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, General Catalyst FOLLOW Because with a global mandate across all marketing and communications, the former Blackstone CMO and 10-year Meta veteran, is looking to help redefine the company\u2019s place in its category and is \u201cbuilding from zero to one.\u201d In a category-atypical approach, Gross Samuels is using what she tells Forbes is \u201csurround-sound, cross-channel storytelling as a strategic commercial lever.\u201d To help lead the brand beyond its venture capital origins to that of a global investment and transformation company, Samuels and her team launched \u201c Venture Beyond \u201d, not just a campaign but an invitation to their ecosystem of founders, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. She credits the launch with \u201cinvigorating our ecosystem and expanding what\u2019s possible. \u201c For the year ahead, among other things, Gross Samuels and her team are focused on \u201cunveiling new strategic brand partnerships with major platforms, revitalizing our social strategy with franchised branded series, and convening first-of-their-kind forums to catalyze our community\u2014all in service to ecosystem transformation.\u201d By ensuring \u201cwe play our own game and operate as a category of one,\u201d Gross Samuels and her team are continuing to help redefine what people know of and expect from General Catalyst. Gail Horwood Gail Horwood Chief Marketing & Customer Experience Officer, Novartis FOLLOW Because Horwood doesn\u2019t see constraint in the pharmaceutical category\u2019s deeply regulated environment but a catalyst for integrating \u201cnow and next practices\u201d redefining how the company markets to drive impact. To better connect with their multiple constituencies, Horwood and her team have championed and facilitated the \u201ccreative and innovative;\u201d building Novartis\u2019 Innovation and Content Labs, and establishing its Media Center of Excellence, leading them to explore non-traditional category channels and audiences. They\u2019ve turned to gaming as a way to educate healthcare professionals and \u201cset new standards for audience engagement in the pharma industry.\u201d And while in many categories a Super Bowl ad is no proof of the entrepreneurial, in January, Horwood and her team broke company and category conventions with a campaign to raise awareness and drive screenings for breast cancer. The ad\u2019s creative was bold by any measure, especially within the context of pharma, and is a case study proving that any category\u2019s work can be emotionally resonant. As Horwood told Forbes , \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to just show up; we wanted people to receive the message and take action.\u201d A subsequent announcement of a broader partnership with the NFL \u201cmerges the power of sports, culture, and health advocacy in a way that has never been done before.\u201d As of their Q4 reporting, Novartis\u2019s stock was up over 15% YoY. Charisse Hughes Charisse Hughes Chief Growth Officer, Kellanova FOLLOW Because Hughes is proving that legacy CPG brands can lead cultural conversations\u2014and drive growth while doing it. Since joining Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), Hughes has transformed the company\u2019s marketing approach, leaning into bold, unconventional collaborations and innovations that extend beyond the company\u2019s broad portfolio of household names, including Kellogg\u2019s Pringles, and Cheez-Its, themselves. As Hughes told Forbes , \u201cin an era where traditional marketing strategies aren't enough, we have embraced unconventional, culturally resonant collaborations that push boundaries...(and) elevate our brands beyond transactional products to cultural icons.\u201d To these ends, one example of the work Hughes and her team have done is the collaboration between Crocs and Pringles, which went beyond a mere licensing deal in order to create mutually inspired products for both brands. This included the insta-worthy Pringles-inspired slides and the Crush Boot which sold out in under two hours, driving earned media in publications like GQ, not typically known for paying attention to pantry brands. In August, Mars, Inc. offered to acquire Kellanova for $36 billion. If it closes, this will be the largest CPG deal in over a decade. As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up over 51% YoY. Kerttu Inkeroinen Kerttu Inkeroinen Marketing and E-commerce Director, Lucky Saint FOLLOW Because Inkeroinen leads marketing for this six-year-old UK-based alcohol-free beer brand with a \u201cBreak Rules, Honor Traditions\u201d mantra, which she says, \u201callows us to challenge category norms while respecting beer culture.\u201d Despite having only a fraction of the marketing budget of her multinational competitors, Inkeroinen \u201capproaches every decision with big budget energy,\u201d telling Forbes she \u201csees opportunities where others see limitations and with the resilience\u2014what we call sisu in Finnish\u2014to push through.\u201d And while some may consider process and entrepreneurial agility to be opposed, Inkeroinen doesn\u2019t considering \u201ca well-structured framework what enables fast, efficient scaling.\u201d To these ends, she and her team introduced a cross-functional \u201cgate process\u201d to ensure rapid execution without quality compromises, and built a proprietary digital platform to, among other things, drive pint giveaways in pubs, an in-house innovation that she credits with \u201cremoving cost barriers and unlocking new distribution opportunities.\u201d Inkeroinen leads marketing, communications, innovation, and e-commerce for the brand. Her entrepreneurial approach has helped Lucky Saint become what she says is the most loved and most Googled alcohol-free beer in the U.K. Marissa Jarrett Marissa Jarratt EVP, Chief Marketing & Sustainability Officer, 7-Eleven FOLLOW Because for Jarratt \u201cacting like an entrepreneur is a cornerstone of how I lead and inspire my team,\u201d an approach driving how she has built the marketing organization for this global retail giant. Focused on ensuring 7-Eleven doesn\u2019t just keep pace with cultural and consumer shifts but actively drives them while navigating market volatility and new resource constraints, Jarratt emphasizes agility, creativity, and resilience. With broad responsibilities in the U.S. and Canada across marketing, corporate communications, and sustainability, Jarratt and her teams navigated \u201cover 220 reputation-critical issues, implementing a three-tier crisis management strategy,\u201d introduced \u201cBig Bite Hot Dog-Flavored Sparkling Water\u201d on April Fool\u2019s Day to recruit Gen Z customers and publicize the launch of their private label sparkling water brand. The creatively dissonant effort drove a nearly 10% month-over-month increase in store brand sales and a 12% increase across the category; expanded 7-Eleven\u2019s in-house creative agency, producing campaigns faster and cheaper, all while also reducing plastic bag usage by 37%. Jarratt is intent on \u201csteering the brand out of a challenging 2024\u201d and will continue enhancing the retailer\u2019s \u201cability to adapt and innovate, even in a resource-constrained environment. Nicolas Kettelhake Nicolas Kettelhake CMO, Polaroid FOLLOW Because in a digital world saturated with \u201cperfect\u201d images, Kettelhake is reinvigorating an 80-year-old analog brand, making what\u2019s old new again by proving that imperfection sells. Kettelhake and his team market by counterprogramming and leaning away from\u2014rather than into\u2014digital cultural trends. Because Polaroid images can\u2019t be retouched, Kettelhake and his team have delivered what he described to Forbes as \u201ca counter to digitized, altered, \u2018perfect\u2019 photography, because Polaroid is one of one, and inherently imperfect due to the chemical development process.\u201d Kettelhake ensures the brand\u2019s claim to a positioning rooted in the tactile and imperfect not only drives communication but product innovation. To make a statement against the endlessly replicable nature of digital images, he and his team have elevated the craft of instant photography by appealing to high-end professional photographers, invited digitally-native consumers into the brand by becoming part of sub-cultures, and created a new membership program. By zigging while culture zags, Kettelhake\u2019s integrated, multi-channel and cohort approach has sold-out both new products and film, and driven YoY double digit sell-through increase across the full business. Kettelhake left Polaroid as of April 1st. L-N Drieke Leenknegt Drieke Leenknegt CMO, Vans FOLLOW Because Leenknegt understands that in the ever-changing consumer landscape, today\u2019s \u201cmarketing isn\u2019t about incremental change\u2014it\u2019s about transformation.\u201d Despite its globally iconic brand status, Leenknegt inherited a business facing years of declining revenue and a turnaround imperative. Her entrepreneurial approach to marketing has helped reverse Vans\u2019 decline and position it for long-term growth. Since joining two years ago, Leenknegt has restructured the company\u2019s global marketing team, going beyond necessary surface-level adjustments to deep, strategic reinvention that is connecting dots across marketing, product, and commerce. All of this is driving what she tells Forbes is \u201cagility, alignment, and profitability, ensuring innovation is more than just an idea.\u201d Leenknegt and her team are embracing and deploying an \u201calways on marketing model...that balances reinvention with authenticity.\u201d Illustration is found in their creation and launch of a new pinnacle segment, OTW by Vans , at Paris Fashion Week. Describing this as both a product and cultural innovation, Leenknegt credits the innovation with fueling extraordinary sell-through and, as being but one effort that is helping restore brand momentum. While numbers for the VF Corp-owned brand are off the record, Leenknegt reports a return to growth and that brand and business have turned around. Diego Lomanto Diego Lomanto CMO, Writer FOLLOW Because without the tens of billions of dollars raised by competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lomanto leads marketing for this startup generative AI enterprise solution, certain that \u201cwinning in AI isn\u2019t just about who builds the best model, but about who owns the conversation.\u201d Given their relative resource constraints, Lomanto and his team approach owning the conversation by ensuring Writer is, as he told Forbes , \u201cimpossible to ignore to the folks we wanted to have a conversation with...that wherever AI decision-makers looked, they saw Writer, setting us apart in a highly competitive, scrutinizing and often hesitant market.\u201d The brand\u2019s outsized presence on stage, in headlines, and on billboards along Silicon Valley\u2019s busiest highways was just one part of its scrappy reach and frequency strategy. Certain that \u201cthe entrepreneurial marketer knows the best marketing comes from customers who can\u2019t stop talking about their ROI,\u201d Lomanto created a program targeting analysts, a.k.a. the influencers of the AI category, marketing the brand as an ROI catalyst and movement, turning \u201cour biggest successes\u2014for companies like Salesforce and Uber\u2014into our biggest marketing assets.\u201d At the end of 2024, the company raised an additional $200 million, increasing its valuation to $1.9 billion. Victoria Lozano Victoria Lozano EVP and CMO, Crayola FOLLOW Because despite Crayola\u2019s dominant market share, Lozano pushes the business to think and market like a challenger, redefining not just what Crayola sells, but repositioning the brand and business by repositioning creativity itself. To Lozano and her team have redefined how the company creates commercial value. As Lozano told Forbes, \u201cCrayola is a bigger brand than business,\u201d and in order to capitalize on the former and overcome the latter, she and her team are shifting long-held but limiting parental perceptions about Crayola as just an arts-and-crafts brand by marketing \u201cbeyond the crayon,\u201d embedding the brand deeper into family routines and educational systems. To these ends, Lozano launched Campaign for Creativity , an advocacy movement reframing creativity\u2014and Crayola\u2019s role in it\u2014as a critical life skill; and built Crayola Studios, a content development and production division that creates programming across genres for kids and their parents. The studio already has some dozen partnerships, including those with parent company Hallmark, a BBC Kids partnership, and a brand partnership with audiobook platform Audible. Lozano\u2019s entrepreneurial approach is reframing the brand, its scope, and creating new sources of revenue. Martina Luger Martina Luger Chief Brand & Culture Officer, Ennismore FOLLOW Because as Luger leads marketing for this, U.K. based hospitality enterprise, she\u2019s rejecting the category\u2019s traditional price-based segmentation, and instead deploying a narrative-driven model to position and differentiate the company\u2019s brands. With a portfolio including The Mondrian, Hoxton and SLS brands, Luger and her team focus on disruptive lifestyle strategies rooted in her conviction that safe ground never leads to innovation. As she told Forbes , the entrepreneurial marketer has to have \u201cthe courage to stand on the edge of a cliff because only at the edge do you get the most amazing views.\u201d Luger and her team are \u201cmaking the statement that our hotels are more than just transactional decisions,\u201d an approach further illustrated by Ennismore\u2019s \u201cgame-changing\u201d loyalty program, \u201cDis-loyalty.\u201d Luger shared that while \u201ctraditional loyalty models reward people for sticking to the familiar\u2014we wanted to flip that idea on its head,\u201d and with no points, tiers, or blackout dates, members get 20% off first-time stays, and 10% off return visits, part of what\u2019s driving growth across her global remit for marketing 17 brands, and over 170 hotels in more than 35 countries with another 120+ in the pipeline. Astha Malik Astha Malik Chief Business and Marketing Officer, Braze FOLLOW Because certain \u201cthere has never been a better time to be a better marketer,\u201d Malik is unconstrained by the tried and true and untethered to industry standards and expectations. With a broad remit across this SaaS platform\u2019s corporate strategy, global expansion, and growth initiatives redefining how brands connect with their audiences\u2014and how Braze connects with its, Malik encourages innovation, as she told Forbes , by ensuring her teams are \u201ccomfortable with failure\u2014because it\u2019s not final.\u201d Malik and her team created the company\u2019s Innovation Lab, 427\u00b0, a consulting initiative providing clients agency like services during and post-sales in order to help them rethink customer connections at scale to provide clients, because Malik believes \u201cthe best marketing doesn\u2019t just drive pipeline, it builds enduring and valuable relationships. The Lab, but one illustration of her entrepreneurial approach in action, has \u201caccelerated sales cycles, improved satisfaction, and set us apart.\u201d Malik remains intent on challenging assumptions about the CMO role, ensuring marketing always has a seat at the Board table, and \u201cchallenging everyday actions and standing out when others may prefer to just fit in.\u201d For Q4 25, the company reported YoY revenue growth of 22%. Devika Mathrani Devika Mathrani Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, New York-Presbyterian FOLLOW Because in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape, Mathrani is \u201cshaping the future of health care and changing the conversation in the category\u201d for one of the nation\u2019s top 10 healthcare systems, by bringing unconventional strategies to a category not known for same. Mathrani and her team are challenged not just by their competitive set but also a glut of healthcare disinformation. When \u201calongside the rise of (public health) misinformation, we recognized the need to inform and empower consumers\u201d, as Mathrani told Forbes , they launched a newsroom operation to \u201cpublish trusted information\u2014helping people navigate their health proactively and reactively.\u201d When New York City faced a critical blood-supply shortage, Mathrani and her team drove essential donations by turning donations into a limited-edition product drop, applying a scarcity marketing model common in footwear but not in healthcare. Partnering with renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, donating blood became the only way to get Ansel\u2019s \u201c3 Lives Bar.\u201d Thinking and acting outside category norms led to a 25,000 percent (not a typo) increase in traffic to the donation site, and a 40% increase in donations. Stephanie McCarty Stephanie McCarty Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Taylor Morrison FOLLOW Because McCarty is challenging home-building category norms, transforming a traditionally rigid and slow-moving process in order to fundamentally reshape how buyers navigate one of the most significant purchases of their lives. With oversight of marketing for one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, McCarty told Forbes she is intent \u201cnot just on adapting to change but driving it, ensuring our marketing plays a critical role in our growth and shaping the future of the industry.\u201d McCarty and her team have led the company to create a fully-digital shopping experience, an \u201cunheard of\u201d first for the homebuilding category. As she told Forbes , this consumer-centric innovation drove meaningfully higher conversion rates, exponentially reduced cancellations, and increased revenue. McCarty, whose remit includes overseeing marketing and consumer engagement across 21 markets, has also redefined how homebuilders connect with consumers, turning social media from a branding tool into a direct revenue driver, another category first. Despite an environment marked by significantly higher interest rates, as of this writing, the company\u2019s stock was up over 7% YoY. Sarah Moore Sarah Moore CMO, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store FOLLOW Because as Moore leads marketing for the culturally iconic restaurant chain, she does so with the conviction that entrepreneurial marketing \u201cis not just the high-stakes journey of a disruptive startup\u2014but about leading transformation when the odds are against you\u2014when competition is fierce, behaviors are shifting, and a brand must evolve or fade.\u201d With oversight of all marketing for the chain\u2019s 660+ locations, including brand, culinary menu architecture, and pricing strategy, Moore and her team are driven by \u201cbucking category norms...and the relentless pursuit of discomfort.\u201d A s rising egg prices became their own source of discomfort for customers nationally, Moore told Forbes that she and her team flipped the competitive script and, \u201cinstead of raising prices (like competitors), we launched a rewards promotion where members earned extra for egg-based dishes.\u201d She credits the simple and counter-intuitive move with driving higher guest frequency and spend and adding 6 million new loyalty program members in just year one. Modernizing a brand that is literally rooted in the \u201cold\u201d is no small challenge. But Moore\u2019s take on being an entrepreneurial CMO \u201cisn\u2019t just about building something new. It\u2019s also about reinventing, reimaging, and revitalizing something that already exists.\u201d Michael Moses Michael Moses CMO, Universal Pictures Because in a landscape where \u201call the content in the world is the push of a button away,\u201d Moses markets acutely aware that \u201claunching every film is akin to launching a new business...every few weeks.\u201d Over the past year ,Moses, who has been with Universal for 25 years, seven as global CMO, oversaw marketing for a portfolio including Wicked and The Fall Guy, and as he told Forbes, always with a \u201chealthily skeptical eye on data because its proliferation is an alluring siren call that risks narrowcasting the audience and making all our approaches homogenized.\u201d For \u201cTwisters \u201d, overcoming this siren call meant tapping into an overlooked Heartland audience through country music partnerships and broadening the film\u2019s appeal without alienating traditional moviegoers. For \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d, Moses and his team took a slow-burn strategy\u2014festival screenings, a dialogue-free trailer\u2014helping make it 2024\u2019s top original animated title and making \u201c Wicked \u201d a ubiquitous cultural presence. In 2024, Universal led the domestic box office, surpassing $1.9 billion in ticket sales and securing four of the year\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films. P-Z Nicole Parlapiano Nicole Parlapiano CMO, Tubi FOLLOW Because in leading marketing globally for this FOX owned ad-supported streamer, Parlapiano is \u201cstripping fear from the equation and leaning into risk (to) drive business growth.\u201d As Parlapiano sees it, marketing today requires not just doing differently but thinking dangerously. With this in mind, as she told Forbes , she looks to identify \u201cmarketers who have dangerous ideas,\u201d and that while she has \u201cdone work that could fail, it\u2019s better to throw your hat in the ring than to wait for perfection.\u201d Along with a broad remit to grow Tubi\u2019s brand and audience, Parlapiano works closely with the streamer\u2019s B2B team in order to demonstrate how valuable Tubi\u2019s viewers are to advertisers. To these ends, her creatively dissonant \u201c Tubi Is More Popular Than\u201d campaign did just this, reframing both brand and business. Also, Parlapiano and her team launched Stubios , a \u201cfirst-to-market product\u201d for aspiring filmmakers and their fans, that gives the camera to \u201canyone who has a story and puts the power to greenlight in the hands of the viewer.\u201d The first class of Stubio projects goes live later this year. Over the past year, Tubi has seen monthly-average-user growth of 23% YoY. Lynn Pina Lynn Pina CMO, GeoBlue FOLLOW Because Pina drives marketing for this travel medical insurance brand with what she describes as an \u201cowner\u2019s mindset.\u201d As she told Forbes , \u201cwhen you see yourself as an employee only, you can be passive, complacent, and easily defeated. With an owner\u2019s mindset, I\u2019m relentless about finding solutions and creative approaches to achieve the desired outcome.\u201d For Pina, whose remit includes Marketing, Product and Customer Experience, driving growth with entrepreneurial marketing approach is about \u201cstriking the right balance between building and breaking,\u201d a perspective that has served Pina and the company well, in the highly regulated category, and over the past year in particular. In just six months\u2014rather than the usual 18-24\u2014Pina and her team led the creation and launch of a new product and partnership, Globaline , which significantly expanded the GeoBlue\u2019s portfolio and market reach. Doing so required Pina and her team to challenge assumptions, break down barriers, and build from scratch, all while working across two companies with two different cultures and competing priorities. Pina reports that the product launch reached 80% of its first-year goal within just six months. Surhabi Pokhyrial Surabhi Pokhriyal EVP, Chief Digital Growth Officer, Church & Dwight FOLLOW Because as digital has become 70% of the 186-year-old CPG company\u2019s media mix, Pokhriyal works to \u201cscale fast and scrap fast\u201d in a landscape where \u201cmany new shiny things come and fizzle often.\u201d For brands including household names like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and Waterpic, Pokhriyal tells Forbes that, over the past year, she and her teams have \u201cstarted using social as the \u2018third shelf\u2019 and have partnered with some 4000 influencers in order to create \u201ca virtuous cycle for social engagement drives online and in-store sales.\u201d This, along with ensuring \u201c\u2019no-dead-end media\u2019 and that over 90% of our media is shoppable, is how our teams truly scale fast and scrap fast when needed.\u201d Knowing that today\u2019s status quo can be disrupted in an instant, she and her team \u201ckeep raising the bar with readiness not just for the here and now, but for tomorrow.\u201d Pokhriyal credits this approach\u2014and a \u201chealthy sense of paranoia\u201d\u2014with helping \u201cdrive outsized eCommerce growth versus CPG peers.\u201d In the last year, Church & Dwight\u2019s revenue growth surpassed its outlook and, according to sources, outperformed its competitors. Amanda Rubin Amanda Rubin CMO, Citadel FOLLOW Because since joining the world\u2019s most profitable hedge-fund, Rubin is redefining what marketing means and does in a firm and industry that has long operated behind closed doors. As Rubin told Forbes , entrepreneurial marketing \u201crequires not only showing others what needs to be done, but more importantly, what else is possible even when it deviates from the status quo.\u201d Until Rubin, Citadel\u2019s marketing status quo relied largely on earned media-driven awareness of the firm\u2019s financial acumen, with little time given to its brand or that of its founder, Ken Griffin\u2019s. Facing \u201ca fierce war for talent and very public scrutiny\u201d, Rubin built Citadel\u2019s marketing function from the ground up to better position the company\u2014and Griffin\u2019s philanthropic efforts\u2014among what she describes as a \u201ccomplex ecosystem of audiences, from talent to commercial clients, regulators and policy-makers...none of their journeys are linear, and their perceptions have enduring impact on our commercial success.\u201d By actively building a marketing narrative, making visible what had historically been opaque, and deploying a multi-faceted content strategy across dozens of new touchpoints and channels, Rubin and her team have helped drive a 50% YoY increase in talent applications, while concurrently tripling awareness of Griffin\u2019s philanthropic initiatives. 1x1_John Schoolcraft John Schoolcraft Chief Creative Officer, Oatly FOLLOW Because Schoolcraft conceived and built a new-model approach to creating a category and driving growth for this oat-milk brand and company. Schoolcraft takes pains to make clear he is not a CMO and that Oatly doesn\u2019t have a marketing department \u201cat all\u201d but a creative one, something he made a stipulation for joining the company in 2012. As he told Forbes , he believes \u201cmarketing departments are filters, and it is always better to work with makers and problem solvers and not approvers.\u201d This perspective led Schoolcraft to build the \u201cOatly Department of Mind Control\u201d (ODMC), which he describes as a team of creative problem solvers,\u201d instead of a traditional marketing organization. \u201cThe ODMC doesn\u2019t solve isolated marketing or brand problems, we understand everything is tied together, so look to solve business problems...(sitting) in on meetings from innovation to finance gives the creative department ownership and understanding of the business, which turns all of us into entrepreneurs.\u201d While one might argue with his definitions, Schoolcraft\u2019s approach is working. Despite slowing growth in the plant-based food category globally, 12+ years in, Oatly continues seeing double-digit sales increases YoY. Alex Schultz Alex Schultz VP Analytics and CMO, Meta FOLLOW Because with an unusually broad remit for a CMO, including global oversight of all analytics and business, public affairs, brand and direct response consumer marketing across Meta and its brand portfolio, the analytically-driven Schultz marries the quantitative and qualitative helping disrupt and reinvent how the company drives business outcomes. While WhatsApp is dominant outside the U.S., in the U.S., it remains a challenger brand. Recognizing that the biggest brand-unlock for the messaging app would be product\u2014not marketing\u2014driven initially, Schultz and his team \u201cdeployed product changes to make sharing to WhatsApp easier\u201d before launching the brand\u2019s largest US campaign to date. This effort, \u201cdirect response ads using our platforms and others...(which) bent the curve on topline growth.\u201d Identifying an internal lag-time stifling growth of the company\u2019s burgeoning live-shopping ad business, where customers wanted to boost ad-spends but the internal ad-review period \u201cmeant the live video would be over by the time we approved the ads,\u201d Schultz and his team brought the idea and insight needed to help the product team reimagine the review process, and leading to what he tells Forbes is \u201cexplosive growth of live shopping with business messaging.\u201d At the end of 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 21.94% YoY. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in Meta.) Geoff Seeley Geoff Seeley CMO, PayPal FOLLOW Because as PayPal\u2019s business evolves, Seeley is helping drive \u201ca new approach to product-led marketing that spins our consumer and merchant flywheel even faster.\u201d Seeley\u2019s role as marketing leader is to help conceive and realize new product innovation, and take these products to market across their 450 million customers, 35 million merchants, 200 markets, B2B and B2C, and family of brands, including its eponymous one, Venmo and Honey, In his first year since joining as Global CMO, Seeley drove what he describes as \u201cone of the most significant strategic and executional transformations in our history.\u201d Focused on, as he told Forbes , \u201crevolutionizing global commerce again\u201d Seeley and his team are \u201cworking back from (our) customers to create the next innovations.\u201d Evidence of this and Seeley\u2019s intent to catalyze growth by changing how people think about and use the company\u2019s products is seen in the launch of PayPal\u2019s largest-ever program, \u201cEverywhere,\u201d and its partnership with, among others, Apple Wallet, and in how he and his team are capitalizing on Venmo\u2019s becoming a verb, and \u201csubvert(ing) that soundbite to introduce people to a much wider world of Venmo.\u201d As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up more than 18% YoY. Peter Semple Peter Semple CMO, Depop FOLLOW Because Semple \u201cthinks of our brand, our experience and our proposition as \u2018Always WIP\u2019...obsessing about the context in which we operate and reflecting on how we might react. Our conviction to act is the entrepreneurial mindset in action.\u201d With a remit for the Etsy-owned marketplace that includes oversight for brand marketing and communications, merchandising, media, seller growth, and an in-house creative studio, Semple tells Forbes he is \u201cconsistently iterating on the brand we present to the world, and the combination of channels and messages we leverage to bring that brand into peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d Focused on audience expansion, brand differentiation, and market share growth in the U.S. and Australia, Semple and his team are unafraid to broaden the brand\u2019s platform and appeal beyond their traditional core demographic. Illustrations of their entrepreneurial approach in action includes expanding Depop\u2019s advocacy programs across 100 U.S. college campuses, cultivating a new generation of engaged brand ambassadors and, also in the US, removing seller fees in order to further differentiate the brand and business, lowering barriers to entry, and leading to material YoY market share growth. In March, Semple was named interim CEO of the company. Jinal Shah Jinal Shah Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, Zip FOLLOW Because Shah is driving growth for the buy-now-pay-later platform, by \u201cchallenging assumptions, moving with urgency, and transforming constraints into advantages.\u201d Having led the company through multiple strategic evolutions since joining in 2021, Shah and her team are now stewarding Zip through what she describes as its hyper-growth phase with a certainty that \u201copportunity is created, not waited for.\u201d Focused on \u201crewriting how people experience financial empowerment,\u201d in the crowded and regulated industry, Shah and her organization are \u201cembedding payment flexibility into everyday passions\u201d including NASCAR, MLB, and concerts. To decrease the brand\u2019s reliance on search networks Shah and her team built Commerce Media, a proprietary and brand-direct model, turning a profitability experiment into a fully independent business unit. Shah has also reframed customer experience, typically an \u201cafterthought in fintech\u201d into a competitive differentiator and, as she told us, \u201cfrom an operations cost center to a brand accelerator.\u201d Recognizing that \u201centrepreneurship is about building teams that can scale the mission,\u201d in the past year, she and her teams helped Zip realize a 45% revenue increase YoY. Charlie Smith Charlie Smith Chief Marketing and Communication Officer, Loewe FOLLOW Because Smith is \u201cpushing the boundaries of luxury fashion communication and perhaps even brand communication in general\u201d for the LVMH-owned brand. In a category long reliant on exclusivity, polish, and reverence, Smith and his team are rewriting the rules\u2014and the brand\u2019s renown\u2014by taking LOEWE in an unexpected and different direction, one where irreverence, lo-fi aesthetics, and surprising collaborations challenge convention, and transcending category constructs. For Smith and his team, challenging the status quo is rooted in what he told Forbes is their \u201ccollective willingness to embrace failure enabling us to push boundaries.\u201d Over the past year, Smith\u2019s How to Pronounce LOEWE campaign \u201ctackled head-on that many don\u2019t know how to pronounce our name, something other brands might have shied away from.\u201d He and his team turned a might-have-been-traditional celebrity campaign with Daniel Craig into subversive storytelling, creating \u201ca fresh context and a lot of conversation.\u201d Similarly, LOEWE\u2019s Suna Fujita collaboration reimagined the Japanese ceramist duo\u2019s whimsical figures as an animated universe, pop-ups, and a children\u2019s book, blending artistry with commerce in an entirely new way. Despite a challenging period for many luxury labels, in October, reports indicated LOEWE\u2019s sales had increased 27.5% YoY. In March, long-time Creative Director Jonathan Anderson left the label, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez were appointed. John Solomon John Solomon CMO, Therabody FOLLOW Because as Solomon leads global marketing for this wellness pioneer, \u201cthe biggest breakthroughs haven\u2019t come from rigid planning; they\u2019ve emerged from a willingness to seize unplanned, unbudgeted opportunities driving real consumer connection.\u201d The private-equity backed company is expanding into new verticals, markets, and audiences, without a commensurate expansion in marketing resources, but for Solomon and his team, \u201cwith no roadmap and limited resources\u201d, as he told Forbes , \u201cproved that speed and ingenuity can outpace size and budget constraints.\u201d By leaning into other brands\u2019 reach to supplement their own, Solomon and his team forged relationships with Sephora, developing a co-brand product leading to a 50% increase in the vertical YoY; with United Airlines to drive trial in their lounges; and when faced with the challenge of excess inventory, partnered with Hollywood and sports powerhouse CAA, to \u201cturn a potential problem into an opportunity,\u201d executing Name, Image and Likeness deals with tier 1 college football programs, \u201cto ensure Therabody was in the hands of the next generation of elite athletes\u2014who eagerly shared their experience on social media.\u201d Despite their flat marketing budget, Solomon reports their core wellness category grew 40% YoY. Marc Speichert Marc Speichert Chief Commercial Officer, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts FOLLOW Because Speichert, the first to have this title and combination of B2B and B2C responsibilities in the iconic brand\u2019s corporate history, is reimagining where the brand plays and how commercial returns are driven. Recognizing that organizational structure either facilitates or limits growth, over the past year, Speichert has integrated teams once operating separately, telling Forbes he has optimized \u201cend-to-end strategy and execution,\u201d reimagining corporate structure with \u201cmirror organizations...embedding subject matter experts within regions, allowing them to drive local agendas with autonomy, agility, and greater self-sufficiency.\u201d Long synonymous with hotel luxury, for Speichert and his team, driving growth and innovating at scale, has led them to take the brand into new businesses and categories. This includes launching the first branded Yacht voyage in January, which he describes as \u201ccreating something entirely new that challenges industry norms.\u201d At the same time, the brand\u2019s ongoing relationship with HBO\u2019s The White Lotus , was credited by Wallpaper as \u201cachieving something few luxury brands manage: catapulting into mainstream awareness while maintaining exclusivity.\u201d Speichert tells Forbes that these efforts and others are not only identifying and commercializing untapped \u201cwhite space\u201d but also leading the privately-owned company to record-breaking performance. Kate Trumbull Kate Trumbull EVP, Global CMO, Domino\u2019s FOLLOW Because, over the past year, in a category challenged by macro-economics and constrained consumer spending, Trumbull markets the iconic QSR brand determined to \u201cget speeding tickets, not parking tickets,\u201d as she told Forbes . Trumbull leads marketing for the brand and its 20,000 franchisees with an action-first approach believing \u201cpeople will like you for what you say, but they\u2019ll love you for what you do.\u201d For Trumbull and her team, brand actions are redefining \u201cvalue-driven initiatives beyond price (to) break through the sea of the same offers\u201d that have historically driven the category by \u201cturning consumer value into talk value.\u201d Efforts have included countering shrinkflation with MOREflation , reimagining a traditional buy-one-get-one offer as a brand equity moment with their Emergency Pizza 2.0 campaign, and turning a basic $3 coupon on its head with their You Tip, We Tip driver-appreciation effort. With oversight of Domino\u2019s marketing, product innovation, strategic partnerships and national sales, in over 90 global markets, and despite economic headwinds, Domino\u2019s has posted three consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales and order growth. As of this writing, the company\u2019s stock is up over 6% YoY. Sumit Virmani Sumit Virmani CMO, Infosys FOLLOW Because as he leads global marketing for the India-based IT services company, Virmani \u201cvalues the entrepreneurial attitude over mere skills, celebrating risk-taking, experimentation and recognizing excellence through failures that teach, not just successes.\u201d Despite competing against global companies that are better resourced and funded, it\u2019s this approach to marketing that is driving how Virmani and his team create differentiated and deeper connections to the brand as a short-term and long-term growth lever. Evidence of the approach in action includes Infosys\u2019s move into sonic branding, a strategy more typical for B2C marketers than B2B, where brand identity is typically limited to the visual. Certain that \u201cB2B clients (also) value an emotive connection and there\u2019s no reason for B2B to appeal only to the visual sense,\u201d Virmani and his team launched of The Sound of Opportunity\u2014a sonic signature, which was played more than 5 million times in its first six months. As AI continues shaping and reshaping the marketing landscape, Virmani is determined to ensure Infosys helps lead the way for its clients and prospective ones by investing \u201cdeeply\u201d in its brand. Over the past five years, and according to Brand Finance, Infosys\u2019s brand value has increased by 15% YoY, and the fastest-growing IT Services brand over the last 5 years. Marc Weinstock Marc Weinstock President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, Paramount Pictures Because Weinstock markets the studio\u2019s slate of films understanding that in today\u2019s rapidly changing content landscape a \u201cthink-different mindset is crucial. If you can\u2019t think outside the box and blaze a new trail, you\u2019ll simply fall flat.\u201d Over the past year, and for films and sequels including \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d, \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One \u201d, and \u201cGladiator 2 \u201d, Weinstock and his team were responsible not just for \u201ccreating or recreating a brand from the ground up nearly every four weeks\u201d as he told Forbes but, more relevantly, for leading the studio to five #1 domestic openings and three franchise-best sequel performances, despite sequels typically underperforming the originals. For Weinstock, success requires not just overcoming competition\u2014but inertia and staying home\u2014and makes marketing innovation mission critical, leading Weinstock and his team to work \u201cwith key platforms in ways no one\u2019s ever done.\u201d Examples include partnering with Snapchat to \u201creach every one of their users at once,\u201d and a \u201cMission Impossible \u201d interstitial starring Tom Cruise in this year\u2019s Super Bowl. In the midst of the parent company\u2019s reorganizations and sale process, in 2024, Paramount\u2019s filmed entertainment division revenues increased 67% YoY. Kate Wik Kate Wik CMO, Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority FOLLOW Because when a brand is as defined in the public consciousness as Las Vegas, expanding perceptions required Wik to reinvent the traditional destination marketing playbook. With a remit to market and sell Vegas globally and, as Wik told Forbes, \u201cin an increasingly noisy world, with an abundance of competition in every category\u201d breaking through requires thinking entrepreneurially. To these ends, Wik and her team expanded on the city\u2019s entertainment roots by focusing on two marquee events, Super Bowl LVIII and Formula 1. But, shifting perceptions for one of the most \u201cbranded\u201d cities in the world, required going beyond \u201csponsorship\u201d and doing things differently. Wik \u201cchallenged my teams and my partnerships with the NFL and Formula 1 to leverage their spotlights as a year-round marketing platform.\u201d By thinking beyond the traditional window, she and her team helped reset the rules of destination marketing. \u201cMy product is Las Vegas,\u201d Wik told Forbes , and the results of her repositioning it as \u201c The Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World\u201d are measured in broadened perceptions of a brand historically linked to \u201c What Happens Here Stays Here ,\u201d and in billions of dollars in direct revenues. Edoardo Zegna Edoardo Zegna Chief Marketing , Digital, and Sustainability Officer, Zegna FOLLOW Because in a marketing landscape evolving at warp speed, this fourth-generation leader of the Italian brand\u2019s founding family says, \u201cmy goal is to make Zegna the slowest company in the world.\u201d Zegna\u2019s approach to driving the business is instead rooted in his belief that, as he told Forbes , \u201cto build a product that lasts forever, you have to be slow; patience and time are indispensable ingredients to create a timeless brand.\u201d This perspective finds the brand\u2019s marketing not disrupting category convention so much as ignoring it. Describing his role at the 115-year-old company, not by his multi-hyphenate remit but as \u201cthe custodian of Zegna feelings\u201d, he and his team see their work as he told another publication about creating \u201cunscalable ideas and then figuring out a way to scale them.\u201d All but singularly focused on giving space\u2014often literal\u2014to stories and the emotions they engender, Zegna and his team launched, among other platforms, Villa Zegna , a private-club pop-up bringing the brand\u2019s heritage to life in key markets globally; turned a children\u2019s book about the company\u2019s origins into a week-long immersive experience in Milan, the first Zenga event with no clothes in it; and are creating Oasi Zegna (a Zegna Oasis) destinations around the world, as places to be slow and as metaphor for ZEGNA\u2019s commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and lasting impact.

They just didn't honor. Nothing to do with buyers. ZuluOz on 15/04/2025 - 15:19 @marshmall0w2: It is when that voucher isn't supposed to be used for that item. When they do a two for one they are clearing and overstock, they have calculated they will lose an amount per order but they clear the excess inventory. When the $30 discount code comes into it that loss increases, then the volume they sell becomes an issue quickly. Dreamcast on 15/04/2025 - 16:00 @marshmall0w2: Yeah I know.

It doesn't taste as good if not freshly blended. In the afternoons, I use it to shred confidential documents at my desk.

Maybe something fun for kids instead of pricey boost juice type places.

It has so many bad things: - It is not strong enough to crush ice or even frozen fruit. - When it blends, it's also so loud. - The blender is heavy and bulky. - 4 blades so it doesnt blend or mix well. -Double the price of my last blender and doesnt work as well as it. - Limited colour options for girls. - Difficult to clean as the base gap too narrow. - Box states can convert to take away cap but no cap included. - usb C has no cap so water gets in when you clean / rinse it. Overall bad design compare to my last blender (on amazon and only for $32 , half price). For a big brand like nutribullet, this is a rip off and disappointment. It's obviously the team doesnt put thought into it and make it gender neutral. Pls dont waste your money on this. The plus points: + good plastic + has measurement indicator. + tight lock and has dot indicator when it closes Wont buy again - I feel like throwing my money away with this product and now sticks with it for a few months \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 .

It trouble even blending/mixing a banana or anything thicker than liquids and a pretty poor battery life. Cleaning the base where the power source is located is tricky and food get stuck. The pretty colours and solid build are its only strong points for me. Maddsyz27 on 14/04/2025 - 21:50 +1 The NutriBullet Flip Portable Blender (Tritan) is sooo much better.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST WASHINGTON: Facebook parent Meta Platforms faces a high-stakes trial in Washington starting on Monday (Apr 14) on claims it built an illegal social media monopoly by spending billions of dollars to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp, in a case where US antitrust enforcers seek to unwind the deals. The acquisitions more than a decade ago aimed to eliminate nascent competitors who could threaten Facebook's status as the go-to social media platform for users to connect with friends and family, the US Federal Trade Commission claims. It filed the case in 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. The FTC seeks to force Meta to restructure or sell parts of its business, including Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead called the case weak and a deterrent to tech investment in a blog post on Sunday. \"It's absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok,\" she wrote. Related: Trump extends TikTok sale deadline by 75 days; sources say China signalled it would reject deal over tariffs The case poses an existential threat to Meta, which by some estimates earns about half of its US advertising revenue from Instagram, while also giving the public its first real measure of how strongly the new Trump administration will follow up on its promises to take on Big Tech. Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating US$1 million to Trump's inauguration. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. \"The Trump-Vance FTC could not be more ready for this trial,\" said FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson, adding, \"We are blessed with some of the most hardworking and intelligent lawyers in the country who are working around the clock.\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg looks on before the luncheon on the inauguration day of U.S. President Donald Trump's second Presidential term in Washington, US, Jan 20, 2025. (File photo: REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) ZUCKERBERG EXPECTED TO TESTIFY Zuckerberg is expected to testify at the trial, where he will face questioning about emails in which he proposed acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram as a way to neutralise a potential Facebook competitor and expressed worry that encrypted messaging service WhatsApp could grow into a social network. Meta has argued in court papers that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg's past statements are no longer relevant amid fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube and Apple's messaging app. How users spend time on social media, and whether they consider the services interchangeable, will be core to the case. Meta will point to an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook during TikTok's brief shutdown in the United States in January as evidence of competition, according to court records. The FTC claims Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued. US District Judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that while the FTC has enough evidence to move forward, the agency \"faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial\". The trial is scheduled to stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to prove at a second trial that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition. Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line. While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate US$37.13 billion this year, a little over half of Meta's US ad revenue. Instagram also generates more revenue per user than any other social platform, including Facebook, according to Emarketer. WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue, but it is the company's biggest app in terms of daily users and ramping up efforts to earn money off tools like chatbots. Zuckerberg has said such \"business messaging\" services are likely to drive the company's next wave of growth. The case is one of five where the FTC and the US Department of Justice accuse Big Tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies. Amazon and Apple are both being sued, and Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a trial is set to begin next week on the government's bid to force Google to sell its Chrome browser.

The FTC is seeking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp, testing President Donald Trump's promises to take on Big Tech while posing an existential threat to a company that by some estimates earns about half of its U.S. advertising revenue from Instagram. Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Zuckerberg calmly responded to questions while seeking to combat allegations Meta bought the companies a decade ago to eliminate competition among social media platforms where users connect with friends and family. Zuckerberg emphasized that friends and family sharing was only one priority for the app along with discovering other content. In fact, a 2018 decision to prioritize Facebook content shared by users' friends over video posts and other public content failed to grasp a shift toward users sharing that content via messages instead of posting life updates in their feeds, Zuckerberg said. \"I think we misunderstood how social engagement online was evolving,\" Zuckerberg said. \"People just kept on engaging with more and more stuff that wasn't what their friends were doing,\" he said. He estimated that now around 20% of content on Facebook and 10% on Instagram is generated by users' friends as opposed to accounts they follow based on interests. COMPETITION WITH TIKTOK The FTC has pointed to emails in which Zuckerberg proposed acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram as a way to neutralize a potential Facebook competitor and expressed worry that encrypted messaging service WhatsApp could grow into a social network. Meta has argued that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg's past statements are no longer relevant amid competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube and Apple's messaging app. How users spend time on social media and which services they consider interchangeable will be core to the case. Meta will argue that an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook during TikTok's brief shutdown in the United States in January shows direct competition. The FTC claims that Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Story Continues Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that the FTC \"faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial.\" The trial could stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to separately prove that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition. Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line. While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate $37.13 billion this year, a little over half of Meta's U.S. ad revenue.

Zuckerberg has said that such \"business messaging\" services are likely to drive the company's next wave of growth. TRUMP VS. BIG TECH The case is part of a crackdown on Big Tech started during Trump's first administration. Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Zuckerberg has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google also face antitrust lawsuits by U.S. enforcers. Several major tech companies have moved to align with Trump since the election, such as by rolling back diversity initiatives and having executives engage directly with the White House. While a shift from the combative tone the companies took during Trump's first term, it has not resulted in a pullback on the antitrust cases.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) The Associated Press Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\" Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. \u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion . WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. \u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram. \u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. \u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d Related Topics Facebook Sponsored Content by Taboola Trump will explain tariffs on electronics on Monday Apr 13, 11:43 PM Trump admin live updates: Trump strikes deals with law firms totaling $600M Apr 13, 11:58 PM Teen allegedly killed parents in plot to assassinate Trump: FBI Apr 12, 4:03 PM US reveals status of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was erroneously deported Apr 12, 7:24 PM Trump addresses stock market losses, China trade deficit Apr 7, 2:30 AM ABC News Live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/meta-faces-historic-antitrust-trial-force-break-off-120779448", "source": "ABC News", "published_at": "2025-04-14T10:14:26"}, {"id": 529, "title": "Meta faces landmark US antitrust trial that could force it to sell Instagram", "content": "Meta faces landmark US antitrust trial that could force it to sell Instagram - CNA Skip to main content Close Close Top Stories Asia East Asia Singapore World Commentary CNA Explains Sustainability Business Sport Latest News Insider TODAY Big Read Up Close Visual Stories Ground Up Voices Adulting Mental Health Matters Watch Live TV News Reports Documentaries & Shows TV Schedule Listen CNA938 Live Podcasts Radio Schedule Special Reports Singapore Parliament Mental Health Interactives Lifestyle Entertainment Women Wellness Living Style & Beauty Dining Travel Luxury Experiences Obsessions People Remarkable Living Sustainability Newsletters CNA Eyewitness Send us a news tip Events & Partnerships Branded Content Business Blueprint Health Matters The Asian Traveller Brand Studio Learning Minds Weather Edition: Singapore Indonesia Asia US/UK Navigate to other CNA editions here.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST WASHINGTON: Facebook parent Meta Platforms faces a high-stakes trial in Washington starting on Monday (Apr 14) on claims it built an illegal social media monopoly by spending billions of dollars to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp, in a case where US antitrust enforcers seek to unwind the deals. The acquisitions more than a decade ago aimed to eliminate nascent competitors who could threaten Facebook's status as the go-to social media platform for users to connect with friends and family, the US Federal Trade Commission claims. It filed the case in 2020 during President Donald Trump's first term. The FTC seeks to force Meta to restructure or sell parts of its business, including Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Newstead called the case weak and a deterrent to tech investment in a blog post on Sunday. \"It's absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok,\" she wrote. Related: Trump extends TikTok sale deadline by 75 days; sources say China signalled it would reject deal over tariffs The case poses an existential threat to Meta, which by some estimates earns about half of its US advertising revenue from Instagram, while also giving the public its first real measure of how strongly the new Trump administration will follow up on its promises to take on Big Tech. Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating US$1 million to Trump's inauguration. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. \"The Trump-Vance FTC could not be more ready for this trial,\" said FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson, adding, \"We are blessed with some of the most hardworking and intelligent lawyers in the country who are working around the clock.\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg looks on before the luncheon on the inauguration day of U.S. President Donald Trump's second Presidential term in Washington, US, Jan 20, 2025. (File photo: REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) ZUCKERBERG EXPECTED TO TESTIFY Zuckerberg is expected to testify at the trial, where he will face questioning about emails in which he proposed acquiring photo-sharing app Instagram as a way to neutralise a potential Facebook competitor and expressed worry that encrypted messaging service WhatsApp could grow into a social network. Meta has argued in court papers that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg's past statements are no longer relevant amid fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, Google's YouTube and Apple's messaging app. How users spend time on social media, and whether they consider the services interchangeable, will be core to the case. Meta will point to an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook during TikTok's brief shutdown in the United States in January as evidence of competition, according to court records. The FTC claims Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued. US District Judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that while the FTC has enough evidence to move forward, the agency \"faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial\". The trial is scheduled to stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to prove at a second trial that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition. Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta's bottom line. While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, advertising research firm Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate US$37.13 billion this year, a little over half of Meta's US ad revenue. Instagram also generates more revenue per user than any other social platform, including Facebook, according to Emarketer. WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue, but it is the company's biggest app in terms of daily users and ramping up efforts to earn money off tools like chatbots. Zuckerberg has said such \"business messaging\" services are likely to drive the company's next wave of growth. The case is one of five where the FTC and the US Department of Justice accuse Big Tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies. Amazon and Apple are both being sued, and Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a trial is set to begin next week on the government's bid to force Google to sell its Chrome browser.

Diesel demand growth falls to lowest since pandemic Industry officials said diesel still powers three-fourth of India's transport sector but the growth is moderating due to the EV shift By PTI Updated - April 14, 2025 at 05:16 PM. | New Delhi Oil price graph, oil pump nozzle and stock market chart | Photo Credit: bluebay2014 Growth in demand for diesel, India's most consumed petroleum product, fell to its lowest since the pandemic in the financial year ended March 31 as the economy expands at a slower pace and consumption shifts to cleaner fuels. Diesel consumption rose 2 per cent to 91.4 MT in 2024-25 (April 2024 to March 2025) fiscal, according to provisional data released by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Oil Ministry. The growth in demand for diesel, which is used to power trucks and farm machinery, in 2024-25 was slower than 4.3 per cent in the previous fiscal and 12.1 per cent in 2022-23. Diesel accounts for about 40 per cent of oil used in India. Softness in demand growth mirrors economic activity in the country. But more than the economy, it is EVs which are starting to reshape diesel demand in India. Demand amid EV shift Industry officials said diesel still powers three-fourth of India's transport sector but the growth is moderating due to the EV shift. The slower consumption rise compared to petrol was largely due to the commercial EV shift. Electric buses are being rapidly adopted in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, and electric auto-rickshaws (e-rickshaws) have become dominant in many tier-2 and tier-3 cities, directly cutting diesel use in urban public transport.

This shift primarily affects diesel-driven vans and LCVs (Light Commercial Vehicles), reducing demand in the logistics sector. Petrol, jet fuel consumption Petrol consumption rose 7.5 per cent to 40 MT while LPG demand was up 5.6 per cent to 31.32 MT. Reflecting boom in the aviation sector, jet fuel consumption was up nearly 9 per cent at about 9 MT in 2024-25. Demand for naphtha, which is used as a fuel in industries, fell 4.8 per cent to 13.15 MT while fuel oil consumption was down nearly a per cent at 6.45 MT. Bitumen, used in road construction, saw consumption fall 5.4 per cent at 8.33 MT . Petroleum coke demand was up 8.6 per cent and so was that of lubricants and greases whose use rose 12.3 per cent. Also read BP makes new oil discovery off US Gulf coast Overall, petroleum production consumption in India was up 21 per cent at 239.171 MT. This growth was slower than the 5 per cent rise in 2023-24, 10.6 per cent in the preceding year and 3.8 per cent in 2021-22. Oil consumption growth in 2024-25 was the slowest in a decade if the two Covid-marred years of 2019-20 and 2020-21 are excluded. During 2019-20 and 2020-21, oil demand fell as the country was under lockdown in most parts to prevent the spread of the pandemic. For the current fiscal which started from April 1, PPAC has projected a 5.7 per cent growth in oil demand to nearly 253 MT. Diesel consumption is projected to rise by 3 per cent to 94.1 MT and petrol by 6.5 per cent to 42.63 MT . Comments Published on April 14, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.

Future proof as you only need to change the access point and nic to get faster speeds. johnnytran on 15/04/2025 - 17:44 I don't see a point in buying something like this currently. If you're going to get a 2Gbps plan (and don't feel like going down the x86 route) I guess this makes a little sense.. but not until the plans come out cause the price could drop until then (and there could be cheaper routers that may be able to do 2Gbps anyway). I'd recommend just buying a cheap switch, a x86 box from AliExpress <$300, and choosing your software of choice. I have OPNsense on the SSD and when i feel like fiddling around i have bootable USBs with Tomato, OpenWRT, DD-WRT etc. they all work flawlessly. No Wi-Fi 7 devices so i use my Asus AX86U Pro as an AP until i start upgrading the tech in my home.

The HS10 can go up to 1100 lumen. shaneiwey on 14/04/2025 - 20:15 +5 I have one of these. Great head torch and normal torch. Compact and lasts for a fair while consisdering its size. Hella bright too. RedHab on 15/04/2025 - 08:55 Yes, they are pretty good. Worth reading the manual for all the weird modes it has. Only downside is that you need a particularly long USB C connector to charge it. bargainbonger on 14/04/2025 - 20:39 +5 Love mine, it's my backup and often main for working under a floor or in a roof cavity. Fits in your pocket. Lolitsjoel on 15/04/2025 - 15:25 How long does battery last at max brightness? Wanting a spare to my ledlenser for the same BarginHunter on 14/04/2025 - 21:34 Is 4000k better or 5000k? Flyerone on 14/04/2025 - 21:45 Yes bdo207 on 14/04/2025 - 21:50 Yes 4000 is better? rumblytangara on 14/04/2025 - 22:29 -3 6000K best junet on 14/04/2025 - 21:51 I got the 5000k one, figured I\u2019d be using it more for task lighting and visibility. Karijini on 14/04/2025 - 22:55 +4 5000K is closer to natural daylight (which is 5500 to 6500K) 4000K will have a slightly warmer yellow tone. Similar to afternoon or morning sunlight. My pick of the two is definitely 5000K as it will offer better colour rendition. This may help visualise the difference https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/2930/files/Common-LED\u2026 aussieprepper on 14/04/2025 - 23:41 +1 5000Kelvin is a good mix between output and tint, I do prefer 4500-5000k personally. Cleremy on 15/04/2025 - 05:44 I have a similar sofirn headlamp in 3000k for night time low lumen use. wt860 on 14/04/2025 - 21:38 +2 The stock battery runs flat very fast amoretpax199 on 14/04/2025 - 21:40 +1 I got one!

Nice and light, i prefer it over the 18650 headlamps. yoho on 14/04/2025 - 22:17 bought another one to keep in the car. Ended up as US$14.07 (after GST), so I will take that as a win cheekymonkey97 on 14/04/2025 - 22:52 No red light is a deal breaker sadly. Mr Law on 14/04/2025 - 23:01 Only cost me $15.98 AUD for the 5000k version! carmar on 15/04/2025 - 04:31 First time purchasing on AliExpress?

Cleremy on 15/04/2025 - 05:47 +1 Yes, it means that thermal conductivity is working properly. bcYield on 15/04/2025 - 19:03 I'm worried about burning my head. Sure, heat trap is no good but power loss too much to heat is no good too. Arrox on 15/04/2025 - 08:24 Hi guys, does anyone know the average battery usage time on one of these headlights. I'm looking for one to do night hiking or running. Would this be suitable? junet on 15/04/2025 - 08:41 +2 Hey, someone graphed their runtimes for each mode here - https://budgetlightforum.com/t/review-sofirn-hs10-lh351d-500\u2026 RedHab on 15/04/2025 - 08:59 The battery is easily swap-able so you can carry a spare. Arty.R on 15/04/2025 - 09:04 Anyone have a recommendation on whether this one is good for running at night? Will it bob up and down? Is there something more appropriate than this? bananabendera on 15/04/2025 - 09:13 +1 You could use this but the runtime isn't very long, something that uses 18650 or AA (not as bright) is a good bet if you want to go for one of the cheaper Chinese manufacturers. You'll want a headband with a third middle strap to stop bobbing too. Eg my favourite for running/hiking at night is my acebeam h40 RichardMelbourne on 15/04/2025 - 09:13 Strange - it's showing, \"Item not deliverable to the selected address\" - my address is in Melbourne\u2026 antman on 15/04/2025 - 11:15 Same. loksmack on 15/04/2025 - 09:17 I have one and love it. Definitely my favourite feature is the 'moon mode' where it shines very very dull - perfect for not waking people up in a tent while camping. It does get extremely bright, but with that comes an insane amount of heat. You can easily burn yourself in seconds on the highest brightness. Have fun figuring out how to put the head strap together! ewieb on 15/04/2025 - 09:29 +1 I had to use my phone torch on my run yesterday so this will be great \ud83d\ude02 maddoglee on 15/04/2025 - 16:16 +2 oos\u2026or they're refusing to ship it to Australia. cant add it to my cart Login or Join to leave a comment Login Join Related Products Sofirn HS10 by Sofirn Top Deals Active or upcoming Electrical & Electronics deals from the last 30 days.

A handy-dandy Grampa's Weeder so you can easily pluck up those unsightly plants from your lawn without bending, pulling, or kneeling \u2014because yard work shouldn\u2019t feel like a full-body workout. Just step, twist, and goodbye, weeds! Your back and knees will thank you. Amazon Grampa's Weeder is a family-owned small biz that sells tools to make weeding easier!

We would recommend this tool to anyone who finds it difficult to do the crouching required to pull weeds.\" \u2014 Mary Get it from Amazon for $36.97 . 2. A pet hair remover that is a MUST for shedding season (aka SPRING). This tool is SO easy to use \u2014 you simply swipe it over surfaces covered in hair from your furry bestie! It saves more time (and is a heck of a lot easier) than fussing around with a vacuum and lint rollers! www.amazon.com ChomChom Roller is a Massachusetts-based small biz creating an eco-friendly, reusable alternative to sticky lint rollers. Promising review: \"Where has this been all my life!! We have one long-haired cat and three dogs \u2014 suffice it to say, shedding hair is a big problem on every cloth-like surface in our home. No more vacuuming the couches and chairs like wild when you have this around. This picks up hair quickly and easily when used correctly (fast back-and-forth motion). I will never not have this in our house! \" \u2014 shelby cipolla Check out our ChomChom pet hair remover review for more deets! Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in two colors). 3.

Promising reviews: \"A dog brush that I don't have to pick dog hair out of. At first, I thought this was some form of dark wizardry . But I don't care because this is awesome!\" \u2014 MaddSweet \"I've spent hundreds of dollars on toys, treats, houses, scratchers, etc. for my cats. This is, hands down, not even close, the best money I've ever spent! I got so much fur off them, and they loved it! They look so sleek and shiny, and they are rolling around like kittens; they feel so fresh and happy. My cats are still young (all ages 4 and under) so they were pretty well groomed to begin with. I couldn't believe how many knots and snags were hiding in their fur. The whole time I was brushing them, they were purring and rubbing all over me, trying to get more. The self-cleaning feature is so easy!! A click of a button and all the hair falls off. \" \u2014 Samantha Get it from Amazon for $12.74 . 4. An Oxo salad spinner and peeler set to help you put your springtime farmers market hauls to good use.

(Am I sensing a spinach + berry salad with balsamic dressing for dinner?!) www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love my glass salad spinner! It has completely transformed the way I prepare salads. The sturdy glass bowl is not only functional but also doubles as a serving dish, making it incredibly versatile.

Plus, the glass material feels premium and is much more durable and eco-friendly compared to plastic options. Cleaning is a breeze \u2014 the parts come apart easily and are dishwasher-safe. It\u2019s also stylish enough to leave out on the counter, which is a bonus. If you\u2019re serious about fresh, delicious salads, this spinner is a must-have. It\u2019s worth every penny and has become an essential part of my kitchen routine. Highly recommend!\" \u2014 A. Thornton Get it from Amazon for $36.90 . 5.

I didn't want a bulky candle or tiki torch that smelled like canola oil. I found the Thermacell. It looked modern and promising. We tried it, and it works really well.

Promising review: \"I don't like to talk about it, but every year, my nose becomes super dry to the point where I sometimes get a bloody nose. I usually use some squeeze saline, but it got so bad this year that I decided to get this gel. A dab on a finger or a swab and my nose is hydrated, moistened, and not dry as a desert. No winter bloody noses! It is very light, is not slimy or like Vaseline, and it does not have any smell.\" \u2014 Catherine Get it from Amazon for $3.62 . 8.

I gave these two solid test drives before writing my review because I was that skeptical, but y\u2019all\u2026THEY\u2019RE AWESOME. I\u2019ve been doing the bike shorts thing for pretty much my entire life, but the extra layer is annoying, and bike shorts tend to ride\u2026er, up? I got these as a skeptic, figuring maybe, just maaaaybe there\u2019s a better solution out there and, you guys. Seriously. This is IT. I got the black lace ones, and these bad boys stay put! Initially, I had them on for about four hours, but I took them for a full eight-hour workday yesterday, and they did great! I love that they don\u2019t ride anywhere during the day, they\u2019re super easy to put on, take off, and hand wash, and they look way prettier than my bike shorts. For the first time, I\u2019m excited to wear dresses this summer!\" \u2014 Jill S Get them from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes S\u20133XL and in 25 colors and styles). 10.

Notably, Google\u2019s initial plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022 was reversed in July 2024 , allowing their continued use. This reversal has implications for data clean rooms, which were poised to become essential tools in a cookieless world. However, the persistence of third-party cookies does not diminish the growing challenges associated with signal loss. Users are increasingly encountering cookie consent pop-ups and more prominent privacy notices across websites and apps, which is reducing the availability of data for marketers. This heightened user awareness and control over personal data necessitate reevaluating data collection and analysis strategies.\u200b Data clean rooms remain vital in this context. They offer a privacy-compliant environment where multiple parties can collaborate on data without exposing personally identifiable information. They also enable advertisers and publishers to perform advanced analytics on combined datasets, extracting valuable insights while adhering to privacy regulations. What Is A Data Clean Room? A data clean room is a piece of software that enables advertisers and brands to match user-level data without actually sharing any PII/raw data with one another. Major advertising platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google use data clean rooms to provide advertisers with matched data on the performance of their ads on their platforms. Image from author, March 2025 All data clean rooms have extremely strict privacy controls , and businesses are not allowed to view or pull any customer-level data. Modern data clean rooms have evolved to facilitate more streamlined and secure data collaboration. They allow brands and publishers to combine datasets without exposing raw data, adhering to stringent privacy regulations. This advancement addresses the challenges posed by increased data fragmentation and the heightened emphasis on user privacy. The benefit to advertisers is a much clearer picture of advertising performance within each platform. But, it does rely on a solid bank of first-party data in the first place in order to run any significant matching with platform data. For example, Google\u2019s Ads Data Hub allows you to analyze paid media performance and upload your own first-party data to Google. This allows you to segment your own audiences , analyze reach and frequency, and test different attribution models. There\u2019s one major issue with this approach. Although many platforms claim to be able to offer a cross-channel clean room solution, it\u2019s hard to see how this would be the case given the strict privacy controls in place by Google and other platforms. This is fine if a brand wants to increase spend within each platform, but it still creates a challenge in cross-network attribution. An Example: Google Ads Data Hub Google\u2019s Ads Data Hub is expected to be a future-proof solution for Google-specific advertising (Search, Display, YouTube, Shopping) measurement, campaign insights, and audience activation. Ads Data Hub is most effective when running multiple Google platforms, and if you have a substantial amount of first-party data to bring to the party (e.g., CRM data). Screenshot from Ads Data Hub, Developers.google.com, March 2025 Ads Data Hub is essentially an API. It links two BigQuery projects \u2013 your own and Google\u2019s. The Google project stores log data you can\u2019t get elsewhere because of GDPR rules. The other project should store all of your marketing performance data (online and offline) from Google Analytics , CRM, or other offline sources. Data Clean Room Challenges And Limitations First-party data (the kind used to power data clean rooms) comes with fewer headaches around complying with privacy regulations and managing user consent. But, first-party data is also much harder to get than third-party cookie data. This means that the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, which have access to the largest bank of customer data, will benefit from being able to provide advertisers with enhanced measurement solutions. Also, brands that have access to lots of consumer data \u2013 e.g., direct-to-consumer brands \u2013 would gain a marketing advantage over brands that have no direct relationships with consumers. Most data clean rooms today only work for a single platform (e.g., Google or Facebook) and cannot be combined with other data clean rooms. If you advertise across multiple platforms, you will find this limiting since you cannot join the data to build a full view of the customer journey without manually stitching the insights together. Before marketers dive into a specific clean room platform, the first consideration should be how much of your ad spend is focused on each network. For example, if the majority of digital spend is focused on Facebook or other non-Google platforms, then it\u2019s probably not worth investing in exploring Google Ads Data Hub. Alternatives To Data Clean Rooms Data clean rooms are just one way of overcoming the challenges we face with the loss of third-party cookies, but there are other solutions. Two other notable alternatives being discussed right now are: Browser-Based Tracking Google claims its Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) inside Chrome is 95% as effective as third-party cookies for ad targeting and measurement. Essentially, this will hide users\u2019 identities in large, anonymous groups, which many are skeptical about. To be clear, FLoCs aren\u2019t clean rooms \u2013 but they do anonymize user-level data and cluster audiences based on shared attributes. Universal IDs Universal user IDs are an alternative to the browser-based tracking option presented in Google\u2019s privacy sandbox. These would be used across all major ad platforms but anonymized so advertisers wouldn\u2019t see a person\u2019s email address or personal data. In theory, universal IDs would make cross-network attribution easier for advertisers, as the universal ID tag would effectively replicate the functionality of third-party cookies. What Will The Future Hold? Tracking and reporting are no longer background tasks that we used to take for granted; they now require explicit user consent. This transition requires companies to ask users for their consent to give up their data more often. It requires users to click through more obtrusive privacy pop-ups. It will probably create more friction for users, at least in the short term, but this is the trade-off for a free and open web. Beyond the \u201cwalled gardens\u201d such as Google, some companies are working to build omnichannel data clean rooms. These secure environments facilitate collaborative data analysis, enabling marketers to derive actionable insights without compromising user privacy.\u200b In summary Data clean rooms have become indispensable in navigating the complexities of modern digital marketing. Their ability to enable secure, privacy-compliant data collaboration positions them as crucial tools in addressing the challenges of data fragmentation and stringent privacy regulations. While this would certainly help with the challenge of cross-platform attribution, there will likely be a mismatch between the data provided between different ad platforms that will require manual interpretation. Regardless of the \u201cclean room\u201d technology that will enable this data matching, there is a need to invest in building up your own first-party data now to enable any cross-referencing of data with advertising platforms or ad tech providers. This requires creating and trading value for deep data on your customers. More Resources: Why Do I Need A Privacy Statement?

The two satellites will be part of the upcoming optical relay constellation by Canada-headquartered Kepler Communications, which is expected to begin launching in late 2025. The pioneering satellites will be used to process data from Earth -observation satellites, using complex AI and machine-learning algorithms to speed up the delivery of valuable insights to users on the ground.

Analyzing data directly in orbit will also make the use of available bandwidth more efficient, as only images containing the requested information will be sent down. Bypassing the need to downlink data to ground stations scattered around the world will also mitigate security concerns, such as possible interception of data by adversary actors.

On top of that, the growing need for data centers on Earth is putting pressure on the real estate market and energy grids, affecting local communities The first two nodes of Axiom Space's planned orbital cloud-computing system, dubbed ODC 1 and 2, will be placed on two of the 10 upcoming Kepler Communications satellites, each of which weighs 573 pounds (260 kilograms). Satellites connected to the data centers will be able to operate more autonomously, without the need of constant oversight by Earth-based ground controllers.

This story was originally published b y Wired a nd is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration . Last Tuesday, President Donald Trump held a press conference to announce the signing of executive orders intended to shape American energy policy in favor of one particular source: coal, the most carbon-intense fossil fuel. \u201cI call it beautiful, clean coal,\u201d President Trump said while flanked by a crowd of miners at the White House. The crowd chuckled knowingly at the now-familiar phrase. \u201cI tell my people never use the word coal unless you put \u2018beautiful, clean\u2019 before it.\u201d Trump has talked about saving coal, and coal jobs , for as long as he\u2019s been in politics. This time, he\u2019s got a convenient vehicle for his policies: the growth of AI and data centers, which could potentially supercharge American energy demand over the coming years. One of the executive orders signed Tuesday includes instructions to designate coal as a \u201ccritical mineral,\u201d expedite coal leasing on federal land, and identify opportunities for expanding coal-fired power to support data centers. Using coal to drive AI \u201cwould be one of the great technology ironies of all time: Let\u2019s go to a 1700s technology in order to power 21st-century technology.\u201d Using coal to drive AI \u201cwould be one of the great technology ironies of all time: Let\u2019s go to a 1700s technology in order to power 21st-century technology,\u201d says Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \u201cIt really is a vast oversimplification of how power markets, power production, and the grid works in the US.\u201d In Tuesday\u2019s presser, Trump, trodding familiar territory, targeted Democrats for the destruction of coal jobs as part of a \u201cGreen New Scam,\u201d laying the blame on both Joe Biden and Barack Obama. In truth, though, coal retirement isn\u2019t a function of who\u2019s in the White House. More coal-fired power came offline under Trump\u2019s first presidency than under either of Obama\u2019s terms. Unfortunately for Trump, the US coal industry suffers from some truly unavoidable economic realities. The last large coal-fired power plant built in the US came online in 2013 ; coal plants in the US are, on average , 45 years old. This aging fleet also has higher maintenance and upkeep costs for equipment than competing types of power. The fracking revolution in the 2010s\u2014as well as the increasing availability of cheap renewables\u2014has also made coal-fired power increasingly expensive. In 2023, just 16 percent of the US\u2019s power generation was from coal, down from 51 percent in 2001. With the executive order, Trump is \u201cputting the thumb on one energy source in particular that happens to be one of the highest-cost energy sources,\u201d says John Moore, a director at the National Resource Defense Council. \u201cThere are much cheaper and cleaner options.\u201d While coal\u2019s downward turn in the US has been predictable, something has changed since the last time Trump was in office: AI. After remaining flat for several decades, various industry forecasts now predict skyrocketing demand for energy as companies talk a big game around plans for data centers. In September, Bloomberg Intelligence found that data center electricity use in the US could increase fourfold over the next five years, driven in large part by generative AI. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, said in February that global energy demand from data centers could increase 165 percent by the end of the decade. The promise of new demand is driving some utilities to reconsider scheduled coal plant retirements. In Virginia, where Amazon Web Services keeps 96 data centers and is investing $35 million to expand its campuses, the regional transmission organization, PJM Interconnection, requested a delayed retirement of two coal plants due to increased demand from data centers . Demand from Google and Meta data centers has also kept a coal-fired power plant in Nebraska online past its retirement date . But keeping a patient on life support is substantially different than bringing a corpse back from the dead. A PJM executive said at a conference last month that he wasn\u2019t sure if the market was \u201csending the signal right now that coal should actually stick around.\u201d Building new, technologically up-to-date coal plants\u2014an idea Trump floated at Tuesday\u2019s presser\u2014would be a hard sell in an economy where investors are wary of big capital investments for outdated technology. Tech companies, meanwhile, are focusing long-term energy investments on nuclear power , as well as renewables and battery technologies . Even in states where coal wields political power, data centers haven\u2019t proven to be a savior. In March, lawmakers in West Virginia attached provisions to juice up coal use to a bill intended to jump-start the data center industry in the state. Despite cheerleading from the governor, the bill ultimately passed without the coal provisions after Appalachian Power, West Virginia\u2019s largest utility, intervened, claiming that the coal requirements would raise bills for customers. An executive told lawmakers that even a big new customer like a data center wouldn\u2019t spur the utility to buy more coal-fired power; the regulatory and financial reality, he said, favors natural gas. Regulations on coal plant emissions are a clear target for this administration. Last month, the EPA rolled out a suite of attacks on a wide swath of regulations, signaling its intent to reconsider everything from rules on power plant emissions to greenhouse gas reporting. The agency also created an email address to allow polluters to petition for a temporary exemption from mercury and air toxics standards set out under the Clean Air Act\u2014known as the MATS rule\u2014as the agency reconsidered a host of pollution rules. Montana\u2019s Colstrip power plant\u2014one of the dirtiest coal plants in the country, which was fighting upgrades mandated by an updated pollution rule\u2014has already requested an exemption. If the new executive orders are any suggestion, the Trump administration sees this deregulation, and the targeting of climate change policies, as a key element of propping up coal. A separate presidential proclamation released Tuesday extends the MATS exemption for an unknown number of coal plants, while another executive order tasks the attorney general with attacking state-level climate regulations, singling out Vermont, New York, and California. It\u2019s possible that costs for coal could come down slightly with fewer climate regulations. \u201cYou can run all these coal plants without environmental regulations or reduced environmental regulations\u2014I\u2019m sure that will save industry money,\u201d Feaster says. \u201cWhether or not the communities around those places really want that is another issue. Those environmental regulations are there for a reason.\u201d Costs, after all, aren\u2019t just measured in dollars. Coal emissions include a mix of heavy metals and chemicals, including sulfur dioxide, that can be deadly to people living around power plants. A study published in 2023 in Science estimated that between 1999 and 2020, coal-fired power plants were responsible for 460,000 excess deaths in the US alone. Coal waste, meanwhile, is stored in toxic ponds of ash; spills have cost some utilities millions of dollars in settlements. Utilities, Feaster says, have priced in the health risks of coal and the liabilities that come with coal into their decisions. But it\u2019s not clear if the Trump administration understands these risks. Cuts at Health and Human Services this month have expelled workers involved in black lung research and other protections for coal miners at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. On Wednesday, as international markets melted down, Donald Trump posted an invite on TruthSocial to companies to move their business to the US. \u201cNo Environmental Delays,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDON\u2019T WAIT, DO IT NOW!\u201d Related How an Alabama Coal Mine Expansion Tests the Biden Administration Lee Hedgepeth Exported Natural Gas Is Dirtier Than Coal, Says New Study Oliver Milman Pockets of Coal Country Are Embracing Solar Power Hannah Wilson-Black Trump to the USA: There Is No Rule of Law David Corn We Recommend US and El Salvador Celebrate Their Refusal to Return Man Wrongly Deported to \u201cGulag\u201d Noah Lanard and Isabela Dias \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Do Whatever It Takes to Keep Her Safe\u201d Henry Carnell with Madison Pauly Trump Keeps Falsely Claiming Ukraine Started the War With Russia Julianne McShane If Trump Cares So Much About Fentanyl, Why Is He Cutting Addiction Treatment Funding?

Revolution", "content": "How to Survive the A.I. Revolution | The New Yorker Skip to main content Save this story Save this story Save this story Save this story In the early hours of April 12, 1812, a crowd of men approached Rawfolds Mill, a four-story stone building on the banks of the River Spen, in West Yorkshire. This was Bront\u00eb country\u2014a landscape of bleak moors, steep valleys, and small towns nestled in the hollows. The men, who\u2019d assembled on the moors hours earlier, were armed with muskets, sticks, hatchets, and heavy blacksmith\u2019s hammers. When they reached the mill, those at the front broke windows to gain entry, and some fired shots into the darkened factory. But the mill\u2019s owner, William Cartwright, had been preparing for trouble. During the previous twelve months, a wave of attacks had swept through textile factories across central and northern England. The unrest began in Nottinghamshire, where stocking knitters stormed their employers\u2019 premises and destroyed newfangled knitting frames, which they blamed for undercutting wages and reducing them to penury. These attacks spread to Lancashire, the heart of textile manufacturing, and to Yorkshire, where mill owners had begun mechanizing the ancient craft of \u201cdressing\u201d woollen cloth\u2014raising the nap and cutting it into finished pieces. For centuries, the \u201cshearers\u201d or \u201ccroppers\u201d who practiced this craft had formed something like an artisanal priesthood, raising the nap with the heads of teasel plants and finishing the cloth with handheld shears in a ritual of skill passed from father to son. Now came the machines\u2014the gig mills with their cold metal rollers and the shearing frames that needed just one man turning a crank, like an organ grinder playing a funeral march for an entire way of life. Cartwright had been staying in the mill overnight with employees and armed reservists from the Cumberland militia, one of many military units dispatched to centers of unrest. When the attack began, reservists opened fire while Cartwright\u2019s men dropped rocks from the roof. Taken by surprise by the forceful resistance, the crowd quickly dispersed, leaving behind two seriously wounded young men, who died within forty-eight hours. At the inquest, a coroner issued a verdict of \u201cjustifiable homicide.\u201d In January, 1813, at York Castle, fourteen croppers stood trial for rioting and machine breaking, which Parliament had deemed a capital offense in the new Frame-Breaking Act. The court discharged some defendants but found five guilty. In other trials, nine more men were convicted. On January 16th, Yorkshire\u2019s executioner hanged all fourteen condemned men. \u201cI do not think any of them had a proper sense of the Crime they died for,\u201d one witness recounted. It isn\u2019t clear where the term \u201cLuddite\u201d originated. Some accounts trace it to Ned Ludd, a textile worker who reportedly smashed a knitting frame in 1779. Others suggest that it may derive from folk memories of King Ludeca, a ninth-century Anglo-Saxon monarch who died in battle. Whatever the source, many machine breakers identified \u201cGeneral Ludd\u201d as their leader. A couple of weeks after the Rawfolds attack, William Horsfall, another mill owner, was shot dead. A letter sent after Horsfall\u2019s assassination\u2014which hailed \u201cthe avenging of the death of the two brave youths who fell at the siege of Rawfolds\u201d\u2014began \u201cBy Order of General Ludd.\u201d The British government, at war with Napoleon , regarded the Luddites as Jacobin insurrectionists and responded with brutal suppression. But this reaction stemmed from a fundamental misinterpretation. Far from being revolutionary, Luddism was a defensive response to the industrial capitalism that was threatening skilled workers\u2019 livelihoods. The Luddites weren\u2019t mindless opponents of technology but had a clear logic to their actions\u2014an essentially conservative one. Since they had no political representation\u2014until 1867, the British voting franchise excluded the vast majority\u2014they concluded that violent protest was their only option. \u201cThe burning of Factorys or setting fire to the property of People we know is not right, but Starvation forces Nature to do that which he would not,\u201d one Yorkshire cropper wrote. \u201cWe have tried every effort to live by Pawning our Cloaths and Chattles, so we are now on the brink for the last struggle.\u201d As alarm about artificial intelligence has gone global, so has a fascination with the Luddites. The British podcast \u201cThe Ned Ludd Radio Hour\u201d describes itself as \u201cyour weekly dose of tech skepticism, cynicism, and absurdism.\u201d Kindred themes are explored in the podcast \u201cThis Machine Kills,\u201d co-hosted by the social theorist Jathan Sadowski, whose new book, \u201c The Mechanic and the Luddite ,\u201d argues that the fetishization of A.I. and other digital technologies obscures their role in disciplining labor and reinforcing a profit-driven system. \u201cLuddites want technology\u2014the future\u2014to work for all of us,\u201d he told the Guardian . The technology journalist Brian Merchant makes a similar case in \u201c Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech \u201d (2023). Blending a vivid account of the original Luddites with an indictment of contemporary tech giants like Amazon and Uber, Merchant portrays the current wave of automation as part of a centuries-long struggle over labor and power. \u201cWorking people are staring down entrepreneurs, tech monopolies, and venture capital firms that are hunting for new forms of labor-saving tech\u2014be it AI, robotics, or software automation\u2014to replace them,\u201d Merchant writes. \u201cThey are again faced with losing their jobs to the machine.\u201d Warnings about A.I.\u2019s impact on employment have been amplified by studies predicting mass job displacement, including in white-collar fields once thought immune to automation. A widely cited McKinsey report , updated in 2024, estimates that technologies like generative A.I. \u201chave the potential to automate work activities that absorb up to 70 percent of employees\u2019 time today.\u201d An earlier Goldman Sachs analysis projected that generative A.I. could put the equivalent of three hundred million full-time jobs at risk worldwide. One profession already seeing steep losses is computer programming, at which A.I. has proved especially adept; U.S.-government data indicate that more than a quarter of all programming jobs have disappeared in the past two years. For a time, the standard economic view of A.I. was more optimistic. Historically, economists have associated major technological breakthroughs\u2014such as the steam engine and electrification\u2014with productivity growth that, in the long term, raises living standards. In \u201c The Second Machine Age \u201d (2014), the M.I.T. economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argued that A.I. and robotics could play a role akin to that of the steam engine: \u201cThe key building blocks are already in place for digital technologies to be as important and transformational to society and the economy.\u201d At that time, generative A.I. was still in its infancy. But, in an article published in May, 2023, about six months after OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, Brynjolfsson and his colleagues Martin Baily and Anton Korinek described how one of them had used the chatbot to accelerate research: after he entered a few plain-English prompts, \u201cthe system was able to provide a suitable economic model, draft code to run the model, and produce potential titles for the work. By the end of the morning, he had achieved a week\u2019s worth of progress on his research.\u201d Raising economists\u2019 productivity might not significantly affect the broader world, but the authors highlighted potential benefits across multiple disciplines, including mechanical engineering, materials science, chemistry, and robotics. \u201cIf cognitive workers are more efficient, they will accelerate technical progress and thereby boost the rate of productivity growth\u2014in perpetuity,\u201d they wrote. Their paper included a chart showing how A.I. could potentially double labor productivity and G.D.P. within twenty years under an optimistic scenario. The economists acknowledged that a \u201cbigger pie does not automatically mean everyone benefits evenly, or at all,\u201d and cited studies on A.I.\u2019s automation potential. Still, drawing lessons from previous technological transformations, they suggested that displaced workers would eventually find new employment: \u201cJob destruction has always been offset by job creation.\u201d Recently, however, some prominent economists have offered darker perspectives. Daron Acemoglu, an M.I.T. economist and a Nobel laureate, told MIT News in December that A.I. was being used \u201ctoo much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers.\u201d In a subsequent article, he acknowledged A.I.\u2019s potential to improve decision-making and productivity, but warned that it would be detrimental if it \u201cceaselessly eliminates tasks and jobs; overcentralizes information and discourages human inquiry and experiential learning; empowers a few companies to rule over our lives; and creates a two-tier society with vast inequalities and status differences.\u201d In such a scenario, A.I. \u201cmay even destroy democracy and human civilization as we know it,\u201d Acemoglu cautioned. \u201cI fear this is the direction we are heading in.\u201d The Luddites grasped an essential truth: the factory system threatened their artisanal economy and livelihoods. This transformation was most dramatic in cotton manufacturing, as exemplified by Murrays\u2019 Mills, in Manchester\u2019s Ancoats neighborhood\u2014a vast operation with eight-story buildings, steam engines, and more than twelve hundred workers. Visitors flocked to see the complex, which represented the new economy of its day. Cotton manufacturing involved two stages: spinning fibres into yarn, then weaving yarn into fabric. Inventors like Richard Arkwright and James Hargreaves had mechanized spinning with various contraptions, but weaving initially remained too complex to automate. This technological imbalance actually increased demand for hand-loom weavers, whose numbers grew in Britain from thirty-seven thousand to two hundred and eight thousand between 1780 and 1812. Until about 1800, these weavers, many of whom worked from their homes, enjoyed rising incomes. It was a temporary reprieve. In 1785, Edmund Cartwright patented a power loom, and though it was initially difficult to use, some Lancashire mill owners began adopting steam-powered versions in the early eighteen-hundreds. This development, combined with slumping global textile demand during the Napoleonic Wars, devastated weavers\u2019 livelihoods. From 1804 to 1810, their incomes plunged by more than forty per cent. The weavers at first reacted peacefully, despite repressive laws that prohibited labor unions. They gathered a hundred and thirty thousand signatures petitioning Parliament for a minimum wage, which the House of Commons flatly rejected, in 1808. Strikes and riots followed across Lancashire towns. After authorities responded with mass arrests, weavers formed clandestine committees and took secret oaths. Violence escalated in March, 1812, when workers burned a factory in Stockport that had introduced power looms. The following month, crowds attacked a Middleton mill, resulting in three deaths and multiple injuries. When protesters returned the next day, they burned the mill owner\u2019s house after failing to enter the mill. Military confrontations left at least seven more dead. These Luddite protests merged with broader discontent about wartime economic depression and rising living costs that pushed many workers toward starvation. Food riots erupted across northern England in the spring and summer of 1812. Mill owners received threatening letters, including one from \u201cGeneral Justice\u201d that warned a Stockport businessman, \u201cIt is Not our Desire to doo you the Least Injury But We are fully Determined to Destroy Both Dressing Machines and Steam Looms.\u201d Facing Britain\u2019s tight-knit ruling class and its willingness to deploy state violence, the Luddite movement gradually faded. By 1815, machine breaking had become rare, but the plight of the artisans remained dire. Hand-loom weavers suffered most severely\u2014their wages, after briefly rebounding, collapsed permanently. By 1830, they had fallen by about eighty per cent compared with their levels in 1800. A parliamentary witness described visiting a starving family in a weaving village: \u201cWe there found on one side of the fire a very old man, apparently dying, on the other side a young man about eighteen with a child on his knee, whose mother had just died and been buried.\u201d Between 1820 and 1845, the number of weavers plummeted from two hundred and forty thousand to sixty thousand, as many faced destitution. However short-lived, Luddism was of immense historical significance, because it raised what came to be known as \u201cthe social question\u201d\u2014how to maintain the legitimacy of an economic system where workers create value yet remain subjugated to the vagaries of the market and the prerogatives of capitalism. This fundamental challenge would dominate nineteenth-century politics in all industrialized countries. As the historian E. P. Thompson noted six decades ago, in \u201c The Making of the English Working Class ,\u201d the Luddites weren\u2019t simply opposing new machinery. They protested \u201cthe freedom of the capitalist to destroy the customs of the trade, whether by new machinery, by the factory-system, or by unrestricted competition, beating-down wages, undercutting his rivals, and undermining standards of craftsmanship.\u201d \u201cYou want the little steak or the big steak?\u201d Cartoon by Farley Katz Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Link copied Shop Shop The Luddites rejected the moral and political authority of a system that had abandoned long-held principles of fairness, quality, and mutual obligation. Under feudalism and mercantile capitalism, Britain\u2019s rigid class structure placed the gentry at the top, merchants and professionals (such as doctors, parsons, and lawyers) in the middle, and the vast majority in the \u201clower orders.\u201d Yet this social hierarchy was accompanied by labor-market regulations\u2014both formal and informal\u2014that provided some measure of reciprocity. Skilled trades were restricted to those who had undergone apprenticeships, and in times of economic distress local authorities offered unemployed workers and their families \u201coutdoor relief\u201d in the form of food, money, and clothing. Industrial capitalism, by contrast, ushered in a free-market ideology that emphasized employers\u2019 rights and viewed government intervention\u2014whether in wage regulation or in hiring and firing practices\u2014with suspicion. As Thompson observed, Luddites \u201csaw laissez-faire not as freedom, but as \u2018foul Imposition.\u2019 \u201d They rejected the idea that \u201cone man, or a few men, could engage in practices which brought manifest injury to their fellows.\u201d Even technology optimists acknowledge that A.I. raises questions similar to those that the Luddites once posed. In a 2022 article in Daedalus , Erik Brynjolfsson argued that today\u2019s key challenge is steering A.I. development toward augmenting the efforts of human workers rather than replacing them. \u201cWhen AI augments human capabilities, enabling people to do things they never could before, then humans and machines are complements,\u201d he wrote. \u201cComplementarity implies that people remain indispensable for value creation and retain bargaining power in labor markets and political decision-making.\u201d That\u2019s the hopeful scenario. But when A.I. automates human skills outright, Brynjolfsson warned, \u201cmachines become better substitutes for human labor,\u201d while \u201cworkers lose economic and political bargaining power, and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology.\u201d In this environment, tech giants\u2014which own and develop A.I.\u2014accumulate vast wealth and power, while most workers are left without leverage or a path to improving their conditions. Brynjolfsson termed this dystopian outcome \u201cthe Turing Trap,\u201d after the computing pioneer Alan Turing . So how do we increase the odds that A.I. works for us, rather than the other way around? Brynjolfsson, in his Daedalus article, suggested changing the tax system to give businesses more incentive to invest in technology that augments labor rather than replaces it. The problem, he pointed out, is that hiring humans comes with payroll taxes, while income from capital is typically taxed at a lower rate than labor, encouraging investment in machines. Fixing this imbalance, he argued, could nudge businesses toward a more worker-friendly future. But would that be enough to push A.I. in a similar direction? Daron Acemoglu has argued for a more all-encompassing approach. So has a colleague of his at M.I.T., David Autor, who is one of the economists who charted how the so-called China shock\u2014an avalanche of cheap imports from that country\u2014gutted American manufacturing jobs. Lately, Autor has been thinking about A.I.\u2019s social and economic impact. When I spoke to him, he noted that the Chinese-import wave was devastating but contained: certain industries, like textiles and furniture, were hit hard, but much of the service sector remained untouched. A.I., by contrast, may well seep into nearly every corner of the workforce. \u201cI think there is great opportunity,\u201d Autor said. \u201cI also think there is great risk.\u201d The opportunity lies in enabling scientific research and boosting productivity, Autor thinks. The biggest danger\u2014and here he agrees with Brynjolfsson and Acemoglu\u2014is that A.I. will take over not only routine tasks but also highly skilled work, eroding the value of human expertise and leaving people to handle whatever the machines can\u2019t. That could mean an economy in which the owners of A.I. systems capture most of the rewards, and the rest of us are left with the scraps. But Autor is not entirely pessimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a long period where there are a lot of A.I. systems acting as sophisticated tools to help us do the work we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to design for that world.\u201d The challenge, then, isn\u2019t just understanding where A.I. is headed\u2014it\u2019s shaping its direction before the choices narrow. As an example of A.I.\u2019s potential to play a socially productive role, Autor pointed to health care, now the largest employment sector in the U.S. If nurse practitioners were supported by well-designed A.I. systems, he said, they could take on a broader range of diagnostic and treatment responsibilities, easing the country\u2019s shortage of M.D.s and lowering health-care costs. Similar opportunities exist in other fields, such as education and law, he argued. \u201cThe problem in the economy right now is that much of the most valuable work involves expert decision-making, monopolized by highly educated professionals who aren\u2019t necessarily becoming more productive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that everyone pays a lot for education, health care, legal services, and design work. That\u2019s fine for those of us providing these services\u2014we pay high prices, but we also earn high wages. But many people only consume these services. They\u2019re on the losing end.\u201d If A.I. were designed to augment human expertise rather than replace it, it could promote broader economic gains and reduce inequality by providing opportunities for middle-skill work, Autor said. His great concern, however, is that A.I. is not being developed with this goal in mind. Instead of designing systems that empower human workers in real-world environments\u2014such as urgent-care centers\u2014A.I. developers focus on optimizing performance against narrowly defined data sets. \u201cThe fact that a machine performs well on a data set tells you little about how it will function in the real world,\u201d Autor said. \u201cA data set doesn\u2019t walk into a doctor\u2019s office and say it isn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d He cited a 2023 study showing that certain highly trained radiologists, when using A.I. tools, produced diagnoses that were less accurate, in part because they gave too much weight to inaccurate A.I. results. \u201cThe tool itself is very good, yet doctors perform worse with it,\u201d he said. His solution? Government intervention to insure that A.I. systems are tested in real-world conditions, with careful evaluation of their social impact. The broader goal, he argued, should be to enable workers without advanced degrees to take on high-value decision-making tasks. \u201cBut that message has to filter all the way down to the question of: How do we benchmark success?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s feasible\u2014but it\u2019s not simple.\u201d One tool the federal government could use to shape A.I.\u2019s development is its buying power. In health care alone, public money accounts for roughly forty per cent of expenditures, through Medicare, Medicaid, and the National Institutes of Health. Education is another sector where government funding exerts significant influence, as the Trump Administration is now demonstrating. In Autor\u2019s ideal scenario, government agencies would leverage this influence by tying research grants and A.I. procurement to stricter requirements for product development and real-world testing. But this approach faces a major hurdle: in most industries, A.I. development is entirely privately funded, with profit as the primary driver and government directives often viewed as interference. Autor acknowledged the challenge. The internet, he pointed out, was largely shaped by DARPA , the Pentagon\u2019s research arm, which steered its development by supporting open protocols. With A.I., \u201cwe have fewer levers than we did with previous technologies,\u201d he said. Still, he remained cautiously optimistic: \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of leverage there. I don\u2019t think it is out of our hands.\u201d On February 27, 1812, the twenty-four-year-old poet George Gordon Byron rose in the House of Lords to deliver his maiden speech. Fresh from a grand tour of the Levant, he had returned to his mother\u2019s home, in Nottinghamshire, where local stocking knitters were smashing machinery in protest of falling wages and joblessness. The attacks were \u201coutrages,\u201d Lord Byron told the assembled peers, but they were driven by \u201ccircumstances of the most unparalleled distress,\u201d caused by new knitting frames. Only desperation, he argued, could drive such an \u201chonest and industrious body of the people\u201d to violence. He also mocked the Frame-Breaking Act, which Parliament was then debating, along with its proposed capital punishments. \u201cHow will you carry the Bill into effect?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill you erect a gibbet in every field, and hang up men like scarecrows? Or will you proceed . . . by decimation? Place the country under martial law? Depopulate and lay waste all around you?\u201d Parliament ignored Byron\u2019s warning and responded with repression. It took decades for Britain\u2019s political system to acknowledge the deeper disruptions of industrialization. Eventually, it did\u2014passing a series of Factory Acts that limited working hours and child labor; expanding public education; legalizing labor unions; and, by the early twentieth century, constructing a social safety net that included health and unemployment insurance. With A.I. advancing at a far faster pace than the textile mechanization of Byron\u2019s era, today\u2019s policymakers will have much less time to respond. The rollout of automated driving systems alone threatens the jobs of an estimated 3.5 million American truck drivers and perhaps two million taxi-drivers, chauffeurs, and rideshare drivers. In a recent paper, Ege Erdil and Matthew Barnett, of the nonprofit research group Epoch AI, warned that such displacement\u2014a \u201cgeneral automation explosion\u201d\u2014could provoke a big public backlash long before A.I. delivers more speculative transformations like rapid economic growth or extended human life spans. Could we see protests akin to the Luddite attacks\u2014this time targeting server farms instead of knitting frames? And how will the U.S. political system respond? In October, 2023, President Biden issued an executive order on A.I. that laid out broad goals\u2014insuring safety, promoting \u201cresponsible innovation,\u201d expanding job training\u2014but offered little in the way of specific policy measures. Now A.I. regulation is in the hands of a President who claims to be both a champion of workers and an expert on automation. \u201cI\u2019ve studied automation and know just about everything there is to know about it,\u201d Donald Trump declared in a December, 2024, social-media post, aligning himself with unionized dockworkers resisting automation at U.S. ports. \u201cThe amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\u201d Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has said that the Administration\u2019s priorities are job security and wage growth above all else. \u201cThe American Dream is not \u2018let them eat flat screens,\u2019 \u201d he said recently. It is \u201cnot contingent on cheap baubles\u201d but buttressed on the dignity of work, the promise of a stable job, and the ability to afford a home. This vision\u2014rooted in economic nationalism and the rhetoric of an industrial-era social contract\u2014stands in stark contrast to the techno-libertarian accelerationism of another key Trump ally. Elon Musk, who has been described as an unelected co-President, has declared that A.I. will eliminate most jobs and that societies will have to adopt a universal basic income (U.B.I.) to compensate. His company xAI has poured billions into developing its own A.I. model, Grok, and, as the de-facto head of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, he is pushing an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d strategy for federal agencies. Yet if A.I. were to render work obsolete, as Musk predicts, the very economic foundation of the Bessent vision would collapse. Where would the tax revenue come from to fund a large-scale U.B.I.? Presumably, it would have to come from A.I. titans like Musk himself\u2014who not only own the technology but also effectively own a lot of politicians, Trump included. In other words, A.I.-based capitalism, if it is to maintain its political legitimacy, may well have to be accompanied by very high levels of taxation on capital, which would, in effect, socialize the financial returns that the A.I. models generate. Perhaps this was what the A.I. pioneer Geoffrey Hinton was getting at during a recent interview when, on being asked about the economic policies needed to make A.I. work for everybody, he gave a one-word answer: \u201cSocialism.\u201d In the late nineteenth century, it was the rise of socialism\u2014and, ultimately, the threat of a workers\u2019 revolution\u2014that spurred the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to create the world\u2019s first comprehensive social-insurance system, a model that other countries later adopted. Conceivably, a cross-party coalition of embattled professionals\u2014middle managers, computer programmers, copywriters, teachers, doctors, lawyers, and so on\u2014could force a pre\u00ebmptive or at least a mitigating response to A.I. Right now, though, a coherent A.I. policy seems well-nigh inconceivable. The country is deeply polarized, the Trump Administration is slashing many of the federal agencies that would oversee any comprehensive approach, and the very notion of evidence-based policymaking is under threat. \u201cWe would have handled this challenge better in the nineteen-seventies than we are handling it now\u2014and that\u2019s a very sad statement,\u201d David Autor told me. \u201cIronically, I have less faith in our ability to manage it today than I would have had when we were a lower-tech society.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an irony he seemed to savor. \u201cThis is probably a bad moment for A.I. to appear,\u201d he said. \u2666 This is drawn from \u201c Capitalism and Its Critics: A History: From the Industrial Revolution to AI .\u201d New Yorker Favorites They thought that they\u2019d found the perfect apartment.

The owner says that could cost him thousands in product, and many of his Australian expat customers are rallying around him. Canada\u2019s food inspection agency orders Australian staple removed from shelves Ethan Lang \u00b7 CBC News \u00b7 Posted: Apr 14, 2025 6:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: April 14 Leighton Walters poses with a jar of Vegemite in front of one of the Found Coffee locations he owns. Canadian food authorities recently told Walters he had to remove Vegemite he imported from his shelves, saying they weren't up to Health Canada regulations. (Submitted by Leighton Walters) Social Sharing It's hard to get any further from Australia than downtown Toronto, so for a dual-citizen like Leighton Walters, the quickest way to be transported home is to take a bite of Vegemite on toast. The yeasty spread, made from the byproduct of beer production, is hard to find in Canada, but back in Walters' home country, it's part of the national fabric. For five years, he says he's been importing jars of the stuff to offer at Found Coffee, his chain of Australian-inspired caf\u00e9s in Toronto. Until recently, Found Coffee sold jars of Vegemite directly to customers, who could also order Vegemite on toast or pastries with the spread baked in. \"I grew up as a Vegemite kid ... eating it for breakfast every second day,\" Walters told CBC Toronto. \"It's an iconic Australian product ... we've been so proud to serve it to thousands and tens of thousands of Australians, Canadians, travelers and tourists.\" But earlier this year, Canadian regulators flagged his latest shipment of Vegemite, which is only produced in Australia. After inspection, they told Walters he would have to pull the item. The reason behind the decision has left Walters \u2014 and the local expat community that buys his imports \u2014 frustrated and confused. \"Pulling Vegemite off our shelves hits at the core and the heart of our brand,\" he said. \"It would be similar to a Canadian entrepreneur moving to Australia, starting an amazing poutine shop and then bringing in this beautiful, sort of high quality, unique maple syrup from Canada, and then the Australian government turning around and saying, 'No you can't serve that maple syrup because the trees weren't in a controlled environment when they were tapped' or 'They're too sweet.'\" It's also put roughly $8,000 worth of Vegemite, which Walters has already paid for, in jeopardy. Food authority says import not up to Canadian standards Emails provided to CBC Toronto by Walters show that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) told him in January that the batch of Vegemite was non-compliant with Health Canada regulations. \"The Vegemite product being sold was found to have added vitamins which are not permitted in this product as per the Food and Drug Regulations and is therefore not permitted to be sold in Canada,\" a CFIA spokesperson told CBC Toronto in an email. \"As a result, the caf\u00e9 was informed of the non-compliance and voluntarily removed the product from its menu and retail offerings.\" Some products, like cereals, white flour and certain juices and milks, may be sold with added vitamins under Canada's Food and Drug Regulations, but spreads and condiments aren't included in the list . All Vegemite products are fortified with Vitamin B, according to the product's website, suggesting no Vegemite products should be permitted to be sold in Canada. \"It is a manufacturer's decision if they want to produce and sell a Vegemite product in Canada that is compliant with Canadian requirements,\" a CFIA spokesperson said in an email. \"The CFIA is not currently aware of any Vegemite product that is produced to be sold in Canada in compliance with Canada's Food and Drug Regulations,\" it added. Leighton Walters says he's been ordering Vegemite to use and sell in his coffee shops for five years without incident before the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ordered him to remove the item from his shelves. (Submitted by Leighton Walters) That's not the case though. It's still available to purchase at specialty retailers around the country and is sold online by Amazon Canada. CFIA confirmed in its email that Vegemite is not banned in Canada. CBC Toronto followed up with CFIA for clarification on why Vegemite is generally permitted for sale despite appearing to contradict regulations, but did not hear back before publication. Walters notes that Marmite, a similar spread made in the U.K. that also has added vitamins, was explicitly deemed a legal product for import by CFIA in 2020 , after a shipment was mistakenly rejected that year. Walters notes that Marmite, a similar spread made in the U.K. that also has added vitamins, was explicitly deemed a legal product for import by CFIA in 2020, after a shipment was mistakenly rejected that year. (CBC) But a spokesperson for Health Canada said in an email that the addition of vitamins is limited to certain foods \"to help ensure that Canadians get sufficient but not excessive amounts of certain nutrients in their diet.\" \"Some food manufacturers choose to produce products for import that meet Canadian regulations so that they may be legally sold in Canada,\" said spokesperson Charlaine Sleiman. She said Vegemite sold in Canada must be altered to meet regulations. Walters says the regulations are personal to him for another reason. He suffers from spina bifida, and research suggests that folate, a type of Vitamin B that is added to Vegemite, taken during pregnancy reduces the risk of a child being born with the condition. Indeed, he spoke with CBC Toronto from his hospital room, where he's recovering from surgery \u2014 his 65th hospital admission. \"To some Vegemite is Vegemite, but to me it's more about trying to make sure that no on else has to go through what I've been through with my life,\" he said. Australian expats question CFIA, say Vegemite is a staple food Walters says he decided to take Vegemite off his shelves to avoid any penalties while he fights the decision. He's also reached out to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission for help. In the meantime, many Australian expats among Walters' clientele have rallied around Found Coffee to question the CFIA. Ray Wood, who was born in Melbourne but has lived in Ontario since 2008, says Walters' story has been making the rounds on local Australian expat Facebook groups, garnering outrage and support from fellow transplants. He said he was baffled to learn Vegemite wasn't up to Canadian regulations and reached out to Walters immediately. \"What the heck's going on? Vegemite's a national Australian icon,\" Wood said. \"How could it suddenly be threatened like this?\" He said Australians in the group are trying to spread the word, and ask why Walters' chain is being targeted, in hopes the decision will be overturned. \"Why would the Canadian food authorities single out one store when the product is available everywhere, as are very similar products?\" Wood said. Vegemite slight irks Australian minister in U.S. Ottawa shoppers stocking up on banned British items Keane Scheffel, who's also originally from Melbourne and frequents Found Coffee on his morning commute, says he can't understand what CFIA is trying to protect Canadians from. \"I don't see why it should be an issue,\" he said. \"There's no need to stop it. It's something that Australians have eaten for a long, long time.\" He says he has enough Vegemite to last a while and isn't worried about running out any time soon, but he is worried about the hit that this could take on Walters' business. \"I just hope that Leighton and the folks at Found can get a resolution,\" he said. \"It's baffling.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ethan Lang Reporter Ethan Lang is a reporter for CBC Toronto.

People applying for technical jobs are being rejected for using AI in interviews, even as more companies require coders and engineers to use AI at work, according to Business Insider\u2019s Amanda Hoover. AI\u2019s growing role in technical fields is complicating the effort to, in Hoover\u2019s words, \u201cget the best people connected to the best jobs.\u201d Play Listen Now Save Share ATHVisions/Getty Images Subscribe: Apple Spotify Amazon RSS One area where artificial intelligence has been swiftly adopted is software coding. Google even boasted last year that more than a quarter of its code was generated by AI. But the technology is also generating challenges to the traditional technical job interview, where candidates are given programming problems as a way to assess their skills. And lately it\u2019s become apparent that a lot of applicants are using AI to give themselves a boost, according to recent reporting from Business Insider's Amanda Hoover. Marketplace\u2019s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Hoover about the controversy over applicants using AI while interviewing for jobs that often use AI. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Amanda Hoover: They're on a video call with somebody who's supposed to be coding, and the person might be really looking off to the side a bunch. If they also see like blocks of code appearing, that is a good hint that it's being copied and pasted because if you think about like if you're watching somebody code live, you would be watching it be typed out, watching them maybe work back and forth to solve the problem. And then additionally, there were verbal answers, you know, given like questions asked and they're just reading off something that's not related to the question. Meghan McCarty Carino: So what are hiring managers that you spoke with doing to respond to this? Hoover: Some just watching for these signs and maybe blacklisting people who appear to be cheating. Others are doing things more so where they're allowing people to use [generative] AI, you know, in the interview process, because part of this is that it's almost expected in many companies now that engineers are going to use AI on the job. If that's how you're going to do your job and how you're going to show up each day and be efficient and solve problems, you know, because you still need to understand everything that's happening, even when you're using AI, why can't you use it in the test? Like, that's a question a lot of people are having. Some people or some companies are really going to be reevaluating their tests because I spoke to some experts who are saying, you know, if you're going to invest all your time into trying to catch cheaters and enforce these rules, like, that might not be the best use of your time. Instead, it's finding ways to interview better and really have deep conversations with applicants to see what they understand. McCarty Carino: Right. It seems like a fundamental question that you're bringing up is should it even be considered cheating to use AI on these tests? Hoover: Yeah, I think there's a lot of frustration in the job market right now. Ever since tech companies started laying massive amounts of people off a couple of years ago, you know, there's been so many applicants for every job, and that's coincided with the rise of generative AI. So imagine, you know, you're applying for hundreds of jobs to try to get interviews. It's really overwhelming for applicants, so some of them are turning to AI to, like, write their cover letters, edit their resumes, mass apply to jobs. These coding tests are unpaid labor, and some job applicants really feel taken advantage of, so they think if the recruiters are using AI, if AI is kind of part of the job, like, what's the big deal to use some of it here to become more efficient in my job application process? There is, obviously, there's an ethical problem of telling, or, like, agreeing to not use it and then going and doing that. Like, you're lying to your future employer, that's not a great way to start out. But I did speak to people who were saying, like, perhaps a tipping point is coming. You know, if 90% of people are going to use it in some way, that's so unfair to the few people that are trying to, like, really follow the rules superclosely, and, you know, not have that assistance. So I think we're gonna see a change in this conversation about what counts as cheating in these situations. McCarty Carino: One interesting wrinkle you bring up is the issue of kind of younger workers who are coming up in this environment where maybe they're using, you know, an AI assistant for coding from the get-go. Does that result in a certain amount of \"de-skilling\" that employers kind of need to be able to test for? Tell me more about kind of the challenges that this poses. Hoover: Yeah, it's something that employers are a little bit concerned about. You also have companies that are more and more using AI to do the work of junior engineers, and maybe hiring less or using more AI to write more code. And it's raising big questions about, what is the career ladder going to be to come into this industry if you have more senior engineers working with AI instead of working with junior engineers? So it's also raising concerns, you know, if they're going through college and professors aren't finding new ways to evaluate students, to really focus on if they're using AI or how they're using AI. You know, they might ace all of their classes and then get into a working environment or a test like this, and it might be less clear than in the past how much they can really do on their own, or how much they understand all of it. That's some concerns I've heard from people that have been in the industry a bit longer. McCarty Carino: Right, because often we talk about people, sort of, you know, being the boss of the AI. So the AI kind of does the grunt work, but if the, you know, the person using it as an assistant has more mastery, has kind of the broader context, they can kind of see where the problems arise or little things that need to be fixed. If you've always kind of come up with an AI assistant, maybe you can't be its boss? Hoover: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think that people from the outside of this industry really look at coding as, like, so scientific, but there's a lot of creativity involved in it as well. When I've talked to people who have these concerns, they do really say that creative developers are going to still, you know, have jobs and make great products and write great code. The shift might go away a bit from technical skill and more towards creative problem-solving becoming of higher value than it already is. McCarty Carino: What do you think this kind of situation says about the future of hiring, both for employers and for job seekers? Hoover: Yeah, it's really becoming complicated \u2026outside of the engineering world, outside of the tech world even. One of the biggest pain points is that people can just mass apply and recruiters are just really feeling overwhelmed and they might be using AI to try to sort through these applicants. That raises all these issues where we, you know, don't know all of AI's biases. We do know that in the past, it's had problems being biased racially or by gender, and you definitely don't want to see people not being considered for jobs that they might be great fits for if the AI makes those mistakes. So it's really creating a lot of confusion and frustration on both ends, and a little bit of a breakdown happening. It's a problem that's going to take, I think, multiple solutions to get us back to, you know, getting the best people connected to the best jobs and without all of this noise of the extra applicants going on. More on this Perhaps one of the more infamous coders who admitted to using AI is Chungin \"Roy\" Lee, a former Columbia University student who created an AI tool that supposedly helps job applicants cheat on their coding interviews . Lee claimed \u2014 quite publicly \u2014 it helped him get internship offers from Amazon, TikTok, Capital One and Meta. Lee was suspended from Columbia for sharing a recording of a disciplinary hearing over that same tool but he's leveraged the publicity to build the brand of his startup, called Interview Coder. He told NBC that he's now making almost $200,000 in monthly subscriptions.

Not really a \u201cdeal\u201d then. Thanks. Well it\u2019s 95 cents below RRP. PainToad on 14/04/2025 - 21:02 +6 What a shit generation at has been. Hardly any games. Price increases. And already coming to an end starting in 2027 with Xbox most likely to be first followed by Sony soon after. pennypincher98 on 14/04/2025 - 21:17 +1 Not disagreeing but already coming to an end starting in 2027 with Xbox most likely to be first The Series S/X were both released in 2020, and follow the same 7 year cycle the Xbox One S/X -> Xbox Series took, and similar to the 7.5 year cycle the Xbox 360 -> Xbox One (OG). Same thing with PS2 -> PS3 -> PS4 -> PS5, if you exclude PS4 Pro. You're probably just forgetting how old because prices sadly haven't really come down for a 5 year old console yet. Smigit on 14/04/2025 - 21:28 +3 You're probably just forgetting how old Geeze, you\u2019re right about the 5 years. I feel like the extended cross gens made this gen feel shorter. That and many AAA\u2019s dropped late last gen so we haven\u2019t seen a new Gears, Naughty Dog release, etc. Nintendo Switch still hanging about has also made the PS5/Xbox seem new by comparison. eggboi on 15/04/2025 - 09:45 +1 @Smigit: Everything post-covid seems to be this weird time bubble. 2020 does not feel like 5 years ago. Maybe 2-3. Also The PS5 wasn't even widely available in stores until about 2023-2024, which is kinda insane. PainToad on 15/04/2025 - 05:53 The difference is past generations actually had games so it felt like you had gotten value for money. This generation still doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s really started. Disappointment after disappointment. sween64 on 14/04/2025 - 21:20 It's been pretty good for those that got a PS5 at launch. PainToad on 15/04/2025 - 05:54 I\u2019m an Xbox person. Past generations there\u2019s been Sony games I feel I\u2019ve missed out on. This generation both consoles have been complete meh imo. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be buying anymore consoles. Modern gaming just doesn\u2019t interest me. Hybroid on 15/04/2025 - 08:03 @PainToad: This generation both consoles have been complete meh imo. Have you ventured enough out of comfort zone playing the same game(s) over and over to try some new experiences? There\u2019s over 1,500 PS5 games now. Absolutely something for everybody. sween64 on 15/04/2025 - 13:14 @PainToad: Ratchet & Clank? Gran Turismo 7? Spider-Man 2? Astro-Bot (x2)? There's a start. pinkybrain on 15/04/2025 - 08:17 +2 What a shit generation at has been. Hardly any games. Price increases. Yeah this generation feels boring.. Next generation is probably gonna not be any better and might be worse. Just look at what Nintendo is doing with Switch 2 (in terms of price of games and console price, virtual game cards, selling only game code to download the full game, paying for a demo/introduction game) Reaction to Switch 2 has not been good. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be buying anymore consoles I have skipped buying any PS5 or Xbox consoles this gen cos price did not drop that much from launch price.. so hardly any true deals (unlike PS4 Pro /Xbox Series X and Series S).. plus doing shit like making the console thinner but now need to buy these PS5 Disc Drive as an extra cost.. There is hardly any good exclusive games and you can just wait for it on PC ForkSnorter on 15/04/2025 - 06:43 +1 Wow, PS5 was as low as $500 during black Friday, then it hovered around $600-$700 for ages. xdirex on 15/04/2025 - 07:20 +1 Oof. Not exactly impulse buy territory. Standard PS5 with Blu-ray disc drive \u2013 AUD $829.95 PS5 Digital Edition \u2013 AUD $749.95 Glad I got my most recent PS5 Disc Slim for about $408 after a combination of Everyday market 32% cashback and CBA price guarantee cashback. Hybroid on 14/04/2025 - 20:06 +1 It's an official price drop: https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in\u2026 sween64 on 14/04/2025 - 20:07 Dupe. Hybroid on 14/04/2025 - 20:07 +2 Beaten by 20 secs. They get an upvote. HeihachiMishima on 14/04/2025 - 21:00 +3 Scalpers using tears as lubricant affer this announcement. petebern on 14/04/2025 - 21:48 +2 I've always wondered why someone (Sony or 3rd party) hasn't made a 6 disc changer that can plug into the playstation so you can have your 6 favourite games and change them on demand like the old cd changers. Maybe it's just me because my PS5 is in a shit spot and hard to get to to change discs. AeymothSky on 15/04/2025 - 04:39 No money in that! pinkybrain on 15/04/2025 - 07:34 +1 hasn't made a 6 disc changer You obviously never experience CDs getting stuck in disc changer of a car\u2026 Also the device would be bulky and cost double or more this price. Hybroid on 15/04/2025 - 08:10 +1 Wouldn\u2019t that be fantastic! They did used to make 300/400 disc changers back in the day.

Amazon clearly got the memo because a bunch of solid bundles just dropped , including Surging Sparks , Journey Together and Paldean Fates. If you\u2019ve been telling yourself you\u2019re just buying \u201ca few packs for the kids,\u201d this is your moment to stock up and pretend it\u2019s not for you. I\u2019m not judging.

Commander Shepard and crew are up for pre-order, and yes, I already added Jack to my cart because I enjoy chaos. There\u2019s also a Humble Bundle packed with narrative indies that scream \u201cyou have emotions, deal with them.\u201d All in all, it\u2019s a good day to make impulsive but justifiable purchases.

I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary.

Pok\u00e9mon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box Pok\u00e9mon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box 1 $54.96 at Amazon I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards and a bunch of gear you probably won\u2019t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you\u2019re doing more than just opening packs.

It\u2019s definitely a big spend, but if you\u2019ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that\u2019s the right way to approach it.

Four booster packs, a Pikachu promo, and the oversized card that ends up somewhere near your desk \u2014 standard stuff, but still a nice throwback if you missed it the first time around.

With clear blue skies, wisteria hanging over ancient Roman walls, plenty of gelato and beautiful vistas from the hilltop, the setting was pretty special. More inspiring though, were the people I spoke to during my visit. Perugia is the home of the annual international journalism festival , a meeting of media movers and shakers from all over the globe. These are my five biggest takeaways. 1. In-person connections are irreplaceable Yes, I see the irony of flying to talk about climate journalism, but sometimes face-to-face connections, impromptu chats and dinner table discussions are just impossible to replicate on a video call. I caught up with journalists from my Oxford Climate Journalism Network cohort. Run by the Reuters Institute , this six-month programme is proving invaluable, not only for seminars from guest speakers at the top of their game, but for the collaborations that are developing within the network. Learning from my peers working in Austria, Brazil, Canada and way beyond has opened my eyes so much to the diversity of challenges we all face \u2013 and the creative possibilities. Kevin Burden (European media leaders fellowship project manager), Nina Fasciaux (director of Solutions Journalism Network) and Anna Turns. Kevin Burden , CC BY-NC-ND During my discussions with colleagues from my European media leaders climate solutions fellowship visiting from France, Italy and the Czech Republic, I listened to the lightbulb moments others have had and reflected on my own progress \u2013 internally, in terms of what leadership means to me and how I can effect meaningful change, plus externally, in terms of supporting my own team and encouraging more collaboration within this organisation. By sharing joys and worries over a margarita pizza or scoop of nocciola (hazelnut icecream \u2013 my favourite), I was struck that authenticity is the most important attribute. All else follows and every single one of those real, honest and open in-person connections deepens my appreciation for that. 2. Environmental journalism is thriving So many early career journalists approached me, keen to chat and wanting to know more about how to immerse themselves in this specialism. When I first started out as a biology graduate, I worked in wildlife TV production and magazine journalism. Back then, environment coverage tended to be an outlier, an afterthought at best. Climate journalists were few and far between; willing mentors were difficult to find. Anna Turns chatted to lots of environmental journalists after her conference event. Monica Rizza #IJF25 , CC BY-NC-ND That landscape has shifted so much over the past 20 years and I\u2019m proud that this part of our industry is growing, and becoming richer for it. Now, people want to cover climate stories in so many creative formats and that\u2019s invigorating. 3. Science doesn\u2019t have to stay in silos With growing misinformation, (both inadvertent misinterpretation and deliberate miscommunication) online, combined with widespread disengagement from mainstream news sources, social media has a big role to play in how we engage with climate, or not. I hosted an event with Adam Levy about how to make climate science shine on social media. With a PhD in atmospheric physics from the University of Oxford, Levy now works as a science journalist and broadcaster, while producing jargon-free videos that make complex climate issues relatable and succinct. Anna Turns interviewed Adam Levy at the International Journalism Festival. Monica Rizza #IJF25 , CC BY-NC-ND Climate communication is definitely not just about imparting facts. There\u2019s space for nuance, even humour. We chatted about bridging the gap between science and storytelling, how to apply a rigorous journalistic approach to all forms of content and how integrity must be the top priority. That all builds precious trust and creates connection. 4. Time is ticking The next UN climate summit (Cop30) is coming and we\u2019re getting ready. One of my favourite sessions was a talk by Daniel Nardin , another solutions journalist member of the Oxford Climate Journalism Network. He lives in Belem, the Brazilian city that will be hosting Cop30 in November , where negotiators will continue to debate how best to tackle and adapt to climate change. But those strategies, frameworks and commitments can seem dry, dense and hard to digest. Nardin\u2019s publication, Amazonia Vox , platforms the voices of the people living in the Amazon, in forested, deforested and urban areas. He explained that the environmental, social and political issues in the Amazon are complex and full of nuance, which is why he makes local voices central to the narrative. None of this is rocket science. But Nardin is proactively cracking on with it, because there isn\u2019t time to wait. Mark Hertsgard from Covering Climate Now (far left) talks about how newsrooms can make climate training effective. Alexa Cano #IJF25 , CC BY-NC-ND 5. Newsroom culture is transforming The Conversation is already highly respected. So many expert communicators, academics and readers told me how much they love what we do and what we stand for. Tackling misinformation in engaging ways is what we do best. Connecting you, our audience and community, with the most accurate and evidence-based knowledge is our purpose. We\u2019re already bridging the gap between research and the real world. And so now is a great time to evolve and meet this new challenge. Looking ahead, The Conversation can help shift the way climate stories can be told. The climate crisis has already gone way beyond being an environmental issue. It\u2019s linked to all aspects of our lives, from health and education to business and democracy, as well as conflicts and culture. Newsrooms no longer have to function like they have done for decades. By using our journalistic curiousity, we can experiment and reinvent the norm. At the New York Times , the climate team is physically in the centre of the office. At the French newswire Agence France-Presse , job titles such as \u201cfuture of the planet, global editor\u201d reflect big ambitions to integrate climate into everything. At CBC , the Canadian public broadcaster, the science and climate unit has made climate literacy training a top priority for all staff \u2013 not because it\u2019s worthy, but because future proofing makes business sense. As the executive director of Covering Climate Now, a media community based in the US, Mark Hertsgard said: \u201cEvery journalist in the 21st century will need to be a climate journalist.\u201d Now, my job is to turn Perugia\u2019s inspiration into action.

After reading the reviews, I immediately ordered them. They came right on time, and I put them on before bed last night. It\u2019s been less than 36 hours and already these cold sores are healing up beautifully.

Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums.

It's also got a soft grip handle because taking care of your home's outward appearance shouldn't be physically taxing. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Doesn\u2019t disrupt nearby plants. For weeds with long roots like bindweed, follow along the weed's root. You\u2019ll get a feel for it with practice. The tip has a sharper angle than my last one, so it's good for cutting the roots of shallow-rooted plants. It\u2019s a game-changer, for sure. Good, sturdy, well made, and has a comfortable handle.\" \u2014 Hanna Get it from Amazon for $16.89 . 18.

Super easy! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have well water. Something in my well water reacts with copper plumbing and turns my shower tiles blue. Since my bathroom color scheme isn't on the blue spectrum, this is problematic. The well water also causes the shower glass to film up quickly. I've tried dozens and dozens of cleaners and scrubbed \u2019til my arms ached, trying to get ahead of the blue and scumminess . My ambition in life is NOT to be a full-time bathroom scrubber! I saw this stuff on a professional house cleaner's TikTok (sorry, I don't remember which one) and thought, 'What the heck, might as well give it a try.' Oh my goodness, the first day after my shower, I sprayed this stuff all over and walked away. The next morning, there was a NOTICEABLE reduction in the blue, and the glass looked clearer, too. On day two, I sprayed again and walked away. The next morning, the blue was gone except for a few spots on the floor tile, and the glass looked amazing. On day three, I sprayed the remaining spots, and the next morning, the shower practically looked new. NO SCRUBBING AT ALL!!!! This is my new favorite shower cleaner. The ONLY con I have is that it makes me sneeze while spraying from inside the shower, but I can live with that.\" \u2014 L. J. Petillo Get it from Amazon for $19.98+ (available in two sizes, two scents, and a pack of two). 20. An anti-bacterial butt acne-clearing lotion made with tea tree oil to help prevent breakouts.

I try to remember to apply at least twice a day. Not only is the skin clearer, but the overall texture is much smoother and softer. I highly recommend giving this lotion a try.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . 21. A pair of reusable Nippies silicone pasties so you can stop wearing uncomfortable bras just to prevent your nips from giving the world a bit of a show. You just put them on and peel them off \u2014 super simple! Plus, they're designed to stay in place for up to 12 hours. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I\u2019ve tried so many nipple covers over the years, and these are just in a league of their own! They stick and don\u2019t move (sweat, clothes, moisturizer, etc. \u2014 nothing budges them), but then they peel off so easily. It\u2019s magic. They are completely seamless, and my husband (without prompting) said they looked like a second skin. I\u2019ve got quite 'triangular' boobs, and they completely mold to the shape and look like I just have no nipples lol. Only when I\u2019m suuuuuper cold does any level of nipple start to show through, and even then, it\u2019s minimal. They\u2019re more pricey than others I\u2019ve bought before but so worth it. The others were one and done \u2014 these have held up through many wears and are still in perfect condition. Will repurchase them as soon as they wear out, without a doubt! No more bras! \" \u2014 Alison BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more.

A handy bug bite suction tool for mosquito bite relief because you're excited about tank tops and short shorts but not the fact that you'll be exposed to some nasty bloodsuckers. It pretty much sucks the irritant out from under your skin so you can live an itch-free life. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I am a magnet for bites of all kinds and carry topical and medicines with me at all times, so I figured this would be a good product to see if it really works. It arrived Monday and Tuesday morning. I woke up with a bug bite on my arm, so I used this little tool (three times per the instructions), and immediately after use, it stopped itching! Less than 24 hours later, the bite was gone! There is a very faint red mark from using the thing, but it's a small price to pay IMO. Bottom line: It\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m carrying it with me everywhere!\" \u2014 Rebecca Get it from Amazon for $9.95 (available in five colors). 23.

It saved us so much stress and, I'm sure, surprise charges at the airport.\" \u2014 Potter Freak \"This scale works and was accurate on four flights. First flight was a test at 46 pounds, and Delta scales said it was 46 pounds. The next two flights were at 49 pounds, and both United and Delta found it to be 49 pounds. The bag on the fourth flight weighed 49, but the United scale found it to be 48 pounds.

Amazon This is designed with medium-sized dogs (30 lbs.) in mind. Promising review: \"We used this for a road trip because we knew the back of the SUV would be too full for the dog, and there would be two kids in the backseat. It was the perfect solution. It was rather sturdy, and, yes, it was a little difficult to fit in the seat, but that can be remedied by moving the seat back and then putting it back into place. But also, it should be tight to be strong. It was the perfect height for us to put her dog bed on top, and she was blissfully happy the whole time. It was wide enough to accommodate her bed and give her room but still, the right size to give plenty of room for the kids' feet next to it. It is definitely one of my better road trip purchases. You'd be surprised how much you can fit in it. We've put in four cases of seltzer that are long and narrow, plus a large Tupperware of dry food for the dog and all of her toys.\" \u2014 Tiffany O.

I'm so glad I got this cleaner instead of sitting in filth, especially because we just bought a new house, and I thought, 'Maybe I should try to find out if there is a special cleaner for these tubs.' Glad I did and can know my tub is cleaned out.\" \u2014 Aaron Johnson Get it from Oh Yuk on Amazon for $17.78 . 33.

I started using these in my riding hats a few years ago and they\u2019re a game changer. They capture all the sweat and keep it from running in my eyes. I can usually use one for a few different competitions.

Still, more storage is always better, but with the Switch 2, you'll need to opt for a microSD Express card, not a standard microSD card. It's a bit of an odd name, right? But fear not, because we'll be going through exactly what a microSD Express Card is, why you'll need one for your Switch 2, and what makes it better than a standard microSD.

Best microSD Express Cards for Nintendo Switch 2 (USA) The larger 1TB card represents the best value option from a gigabytes-per-cent perspective, although smaller capacity cards are the cheapest if you're on a budget. GameStop, Walmart, and Amazon are dominating pre-orders at the moment, but we'll keep this up to date with the latest US cards and deals as they come.

Put simply, it's a small storage device identical in appearance to a standard microSD that you've probably been using in your regular Switch. The difference is that SD Express is faster - much faster. How do they compare? Basic Micro SD cards tend to top out at around 200MB/s read and write speeds. However, with SD Express, you're looking at speeds of up to 900MB/s, putting it closer (though still a way off) the kind of speeds you might expect from a solid-state drive (SSD). This is because they're connected to the same PCI Express/NVMe interface that internal SSDs utilise in other gaming consoles and PCs, therefore effectively giving access to the same bandwidth as internal storage. Do standard microSD Cards work with Switch 2? No, Nintendo has confirmed that SD Express cards will be required for the Switch 2. And if that wasn't clear enough, standard microSD cards will not work \u2013 at all. Switch 2's more complex games need faster transfer speeds to run, and a standard microSD card simply won't cut it. Do microSD Express Cards work with Switch 1? Nintendo has confirmed that yes, microSD Express Cards do function with Switch 1. For example, if you were to buy an Express variant before getting a Switch 2, that card would work fine with your original Switch. One thing to note: although it will work no problem, using Express microSD won't improve Switch 1 data transfer speeds, so you won't get faster downloads or improved loading times there. How much storage is available on a microSD Express Card? From what we've seen so far, you can purchase microSD Express cards in the following capacities at the time of writing: 128GB 256GB 512GB 1TB It's likely that larger capacities will become available at a later date, though keep in mind that you'll be looking at fairly hefty prices for the larger options. Prices in inevitably fall over time, much as standard microSD Card prices fell over the original Switch's lifetime. What's the largest storage I can get for the Switch 2? Nintendo has confirmed that the Switch 2 will be compatible with Express Cards of up to 2TB. It's important to note, however, that 2TB options don't appear to be available for purchase at the time of writing. Even when they are, you're likely looking at a potential price of $200/\u00a3200 at a minimum. What size/capacity Micro SD Express Card should I buy? It's going to be a while until 2TB cards are available and, more importantly, affordable . Right now, you typically have the choice of 1TB, 512GB, 256GB, and 128GB. Naturally, the smaller ones will fill up faster, especially if you buy lots of games. 1TB is a fantastic option for Switch 2 owners who plan to download a lot of games, but it's naturally on the pricey side. If you have that sort of cash to spend, this is currently the ultimate option for your Switch 2. An alternative approach would be to buy multiple cards and swap them depending on which games you want to play - slightly more effort, but more affordable. Just be sure to keep them in a safe place. How do I insert a microSD Express Card into the Switch 2? The microSD Express Card slot is located on the bottom of the Switch 2, just underneath the kickstand. So simply open the kickstand to locate the slot and pop your microSD Express Card in and push until you hear a 'click'. To remove it, push for the 'click' and slide it out.

Author Profile Reply 1 mikegamer Fri 4th Apr 2025 Really hope 1 TB express SD cards come out lol 1 2 Alpha008 Fri 4th Apr 2025 I won\u2019t be picking one up right away. Once I start downloading more games I\u2019ll pick one up 1 3 MARl0 Sat 5th Apr 2025 Gamestop brand? What? Not sure I'd trust that one. 1 4 MeloMan Sat 5th Apr 2025 That's the answer I was waiting for-- Switch 2 will take up to 2TB microSDXCs. Now I KNOW I will be buying the 1TB for sure. 0 5 LinktotheFuture Sat 5th Apr 2025 Will the Express cards work on Switch 1? 0 6 Diven Sat 5th Apr 2025 Highly suspect of the Gamestop brand cards offering capacities not offered by SanDisk or Samsung. @MeloMan you will need microSD Express card, not standard microSDXC. SanDisk and Samsung have maximum capacity of 256 GB currently. @LinktotheFuture Express cards will work with Switch 1 or any microSD slot, but will be limited by the old device's speed. I don't recommend purchasing an express card for Switch as you can purchase cheaper 256 GB non-express cards, or larger capacity non-express cards for the same price. 4 7 MeloMan Sat 5th Apr 2025 @Diven Good to know, thank you! 0 8 TKundNobody Sat 5th Apr 2025 Micro sd cards work with switch 2. but you can only save screenshots and not games. If you don\u2019t plan to buy digital games and take a lot of screenshots, this could be a cheaper alternative. 0 9 LinktotheFuture Sat 5th Apr 2025 @Diven Makes sense, thanks! 0 10 Baker1000 Sat 5th Apr 2025 Really really annoyed I bought one of the yellow Nintendo SD cards a little while ago, since it was discounted. Intended to use it on Switch when my storage was full, but found I was able to still keep my current card a bit longer and it got to the point that I thought \"the next console isn't far away, I'll just save it for that instead of inevitably buying new at launch\" Then they tell me it won't be compatible. So I have a rather large sized Micro SD that wasn't so cheap despite being discounted, which isn't getting used. I know I can find something to use it for, but I don't really have anything that needs such a large (micro) SD at the moment. 0 11 Jester676 Sat 5th Apr 2025 I bought my sandisk too early and spent too much wished I bought Lexar 256 now. The 1tb at 199 and then GameStop at 149 just like the leaked screenshot showed. Those are still expensive maybe by holiday I will get a 1tb is Key-Card becomes the norm. 0 12 Metazoxan Sun 6th Apr 2025 @Alpha008 same. Switch 2 comes with decent memory to hold a good few games. With the \"virual card\" system to better manage digital downloads I can just \"Slot in\" as much as the system will allow and remove what's not needed. I can easily get by without more storage for a while. 0 13 burndive Mon 7th Apr 2025 I've already got more than 256 GB of Switch 1 games, so I'm going to need one right away. I was hoping they would support the older cards--but for Switch 1 games only, which would have let me delay purchasing one until I had filled up the internal storage with Switch 2 games. As it is, I picked up the 1 TB card from GameStop, since I have a Pro membership I got 5% off plus my monthly $5 discount: $137.49 + tax, which is not bad. 1 14 Medic_alert Tue 8th Apr 2025 I'm in for a 1tb express card and I'd bet all the companies that make them are now rushing to get them to market for the S2 launch. Still can't decide whether to go physical or digital mind. I suspect that retailers will heavily discount physical games as they do now where as I will be looking for cheap store credit to get digital games any cheaper. 0 15 Ryu_Niiyama Tue 8th Apr 2025 Keep in mind the new cards will work on the switch. So if you are looking to upgrade and know you are gonna offload your switch when you get a switch 2, go with the cards that work in both. https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68425/~/microsd-card-and-microsd-express-card-compatibility-with-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2 1 16 Thomystic Wed 9th Apr 2025 Isn't 2TB the limit for Switch 1 also? Keeping it the same isn't very future proof. 0 17 charliecarrot Thu 10th Apr 2025 I'm going to wait a while and rely on the internal storage until larger sizes are manufactured and (hopefully) prices decrease a little. I have my Switch 1 SD card mostly filled up, and it's 1TB. I imagine games on the Switch 2 will be larger in size on average than Switch 1 games (especially 3rd party titles). I mean I added a 2TB m.2 SSD to my PS5 and we still regularly have to delete games in order to install more. It's not fun! 0 18 Cakefish Thu 10th Apr 2025 It\u2019s annoying that in UK the only way to buy 512GB/1TB options is importing from the US. I can\u2019t find any native retailers selling anything larger than 256GB cards and considering that I\u2019ve already got that amount of Switch games it seems a bit too tight for Switch 2. So I\u2019ve been forced to order from US Amazon. I initially ordered the 1TB option (\u00a3171.52) but realised it wouldn\u2019t have been delivered until 4 weeks after launch, so changed over to 512GB (\u00a394.01) which should arrive just before Switch 2 launch day. Hopefully that\u2019ll keep me going for a while. 0 19 Elitepatriot Thu 10th Apr 2025 Not sure why the Gamestop listing here is $150.

The flight blasted off from western Texas in the US. It rose vertically before the crew capsule detached mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket.

Sanchez picked the crew, who also include former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut and activist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn. Today\u2019s mission was the first all-woman space crew since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s historic solo flight in 1963. It was also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting slightly over 10 minutes, the flight brought the passengers beyond the Karman line \u2014 the internationally recognized boundary of space. There was a brief period when the crew could unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity.

She added that was shocked to discover during space training that the capsule she will travel in was named the \u201cTortoise\u201d and decorated with a \u201cfeather\u201d design \u2013 the two nicknames her parents have for her. \u201cThere are no coincidences and I\u2019m just so grateful for these confirmations and so grateful that I feel like something bigger than me is steering the ship,\u201d Perry said in the video.

Bezos\u2019 top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin\u2019s much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission. - \u00a9 AFP 202 5 and with additional reporting from Diarmuid Pepper Author AFP View 56 comments Send Tip or Correction Embed this post To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/katy-perry-among-all-female-crew-of-blue-origin-space-launch-6677455-Apr2025/?embedpost=6677455&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/katy-perry-among-all-female-crew-of-blue-origin-space-launch-6677455-Apr2025/?embedpost=6677455&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/katy-perry-among-all-female-crew-of-blue-origin-space-launch-6677455-Apr2025/?embedpost=6677455&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe> Email \u201cBlue Origin space flight passengers, including Katy Perry, arrive back to Earth safely\u201d.

Skip to Content Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa at the presentation of his new book, \u201cCinco Esquinas\u201d (\u201cFive Corners\u201d), at the Casa America in Madrid in 2016. AFP - Getty Images / Source : The Associated Press By The Associated Press LIMA, Peru \u2014 Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa , Nobel literature laureate and a giant of Latin American letters, died Sunday. He was 89. He was a prolific author and essayist with such celebrated novels as \u201cThe Time of the Hero\u201d (La Ciudad y los Perros) and \u201cFeast of the Goat,\u201d and won myriad prizes, including the 2010 Nobel. \u201cIt is with deep sorrow that we announce that our father, Mario Vargas Llosa, passed away peacefully in Lima today, surrounded by his family,\u201d read a letter signed by his children \u00c1lvaro, Gonzalo and Morgana, and posted by \u00c1lvaro on X. \u201cHis departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,\u201d they added. The author\u2019s lawyer and close friend, Enrique Ghersi, confirmed the death to The Associated Press and recalled the writer\u2019s last birthday on March 28 at the home of his daughter, Morgana. \u201cHe spent it happy; his close friends surrounded him, he ate his cake, we joked that day that there were still 89 more years to go, he had a long, fruitful, and free life,\u201d Ghersi said. Latin America\u2019s new wave Vargas Llosa published his first collection of stories \u201cThe Cubs and Other Stories\u201d (Los Jefes) in 1959. But he burst onto the literary stage in 1963 with his groundbreaking debut \u201cThe Time of the Hero,\u201d a novel that drew on his experiences at a Peruvian military academy and angered the country\u2019s military. A thousand copies were burned by military authorities, with some generals calling the book false and Vargas Llosa a communist. That, and subsequent novels such as \u201cConversation in the Cathedral,\u201d (Conversaci\u00f3n en la Catedral) in 1969, quickly established Vargas Llosa as one of the leaders of the so-called \u201cBoom,\u201d or new wave of Latin American writers of the 1960s and 1970s, alongside Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Carlos Fuentes. Vargas Llosa started writing early, and at 15 was a part-time crime reporter for La Cr\u00f3nica newspaper. According to his official website, other jobs he had included revising names on cemetery tombs in Peru, working as a teacher in the Berlitz school in Paris and briefly on the Spanish desk at Agence France-Presse in Paris. He continued publishing articles in the press for most of his life, most notably in a twice-monthly political opinion column titled \u201cPiedra de Toque\u201d (Touchstones) that was printed in several newspapers. Vargas Llosa came to be a fierce defender of personal and economic liberties, gradually edging away from his communism-linked past, and regularly attacked Latin American leftist leaders he viewed as dictators. Although an early supporter of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro, he later grew disillusioned and denounced Castro\u2019s Cuba. By 1980, he said he no longer believed in socialism as a solution for developing nations. In a famous incident in Mexico City in 1976, Vargas Llosa punched fellow Nobel Prize winner and ex-friend Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, whom he later ridiculed as \u201cCastro\u2019s courtesan.\u201d It was never clear whether the fight was over politics or a personal dispute, as neither writer ever wanted to discuss it publicly. As he slowly turned his political trajectory toward free-market conservatism, Vargas Llosa lost the support of many of his Latin American literary contemporaries and attracted much criticism even from admirers of his work. Pampered early life Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa was born March 28, 1936, in Peru\u2019s southern city of Arequipa, high in the Andes at the foot of the Misti volcano. His father, Ernesto Vargas Maldonado, left the family before he was born. To avoid public scandal, his mother, Dora Llosa Ureta, took her child to Bolivia, where her father was the Peruvian consul in Cochabamba. Vargas Llosa said his early life was \u201csomewhat traumatic,\u201d pampered by his mother and grandmother in a large house with servants, his every whim granted. It was not until he was 10, after the family had moved to Peru\u2019s coastal city of Piura, that he learned his father was alive. His parents reconciled and the family moved to Peru\u2019s capital, Lima. Vargas Llosa described his father as a disciplinarian who viewed his son\u2019s love of Jules Verne and writing poetry as surefire routes to starvation, and feared for his \u201cmanhood,\u201d believing that \u201cpoets are always homosexuals.\u201d After failing to get the boy enrolled in a naval academy because he was underage, Vargas Llosa\u2019s father sent him to Leoncio Prado Military Academy \u2014 an experience that was to stay with Vargas Llosa and led to \u201cThe Time of the Hero.\u201d The book won the Spanish Critics Award. The military academy \u201cwas like discovering hell,\u201d Vargas Llosa said later. He entered Peru\u2019s San Marcos University to study literature and law, \u201cthe former as a calling and the latter to please my family, which believed, not without certain cause, that writers usually die of hunger.\u201d After earning his literature degree in 1958 \u2014 he didn\u2019t bother submitting his final law thesis \u2014 Vargas Llosa won a scholarship to pursue a doctorate in Madrid. Vargas Llosa drew much of his inspiration from his Peruvian homeland, but preferred to live abroad, residing for spells each year in Madrid, New York and Paris. His early novels revealed a Peruvian world of military arrogance and brutality, of aristocratic decadence, and of Stone Age Amazon Indians existing simultaneously with 20th-century urban blight. \u201cPeru is a kind of incurable illness and my relationship to it is intense, harsh and full of the violence of passion,\u201d Vargas Llosa wrote in 1983. After 16 years in Europe, he returned in 1974 to a Peru then ruled by a left-wing military dictatorship. \u201cI realized I was losing touch with the reality of my country, and above all its language, which for a writer can be deadly,\u201d he said. In 1990, he ran for the presidency of Peru, a reluctant candidate in a nation torn apart by a messianic Maoist guerrilla insurgency and a basket-case, hyperinflation economy. But he was defeated by a then-unknown university rector, Alberto Fujimori, who resolved much of the political and economic chaos but went on to become a corrupt and authoritarian leader in the process. Cuban writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Vargas Llosa\u2019s longtime friend, later confessed that he had rooted against the writer\u2019s candidacy, observing: \u201cPeru\u2019s uncertain gain would be literature\u2019s loss. Literature is eternity, politics mere history.\u201d Vargas Llosa also used his literary talents to write several successful novels about the lives of real people, including French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin and his grandmother, Flora Tristan, in \u201cThe Way to Paradise\u201d in 2003 and 19th-century Irish nationalist and diplomat Sir Roger Casement in \u201cThe Dream of the Celt\u201d in 2010. His last published novel was \u201cHarsh Times\u201d (Tiempos Recios) in 2019 about a U.S.-backed coup d\u2019etat in Guatemala in 1954. He became a member of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1994 and held visiting professor and resident writer posts in more than a dozen colleges and universities across the world. In his teens, Vargas Llosa joined a communist cell and eloped with and later married a 33-year-old Bolivian, Julia Urquidi \u2014 the sister-in-law of his uncle. He later drew inspiration from their nine-year marriage to write the hit comic novel \u201cAunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\u201d (La T\u00eda Julia y el Escribidor). In 1965, he married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, 10 years his junior, and together they had three children. They divorced 50 years later, and he started a relationship with Spanish society figure Isabel Preysler, former wife of singer Julio Iglesias and mother of singer Enrique Iglesias. They separated in 2022. Vargas Llosa is survived by his children. Their letter announcing his death said his remains will be cremated and there won\u2019t be any public ceremony.", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.8, "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/latin-america/mario-vargas-llosa-nobel-literature-dies-peruvian-author-rcna201083", "source": "NBC News", "published_at": "2025-04-14T09:16:52"}, {"id": 428, "title": "Sterilite 20-Quart Stackable Gasket Box w/ Latching Lid 6-Pack for $46 + free shipping", "content": "Sterilite 20-Quart Stackable Gasket Box w/ Latching Lid 6-Pack: $46 Walmart \u00b7 1 day ago Sterilite 20-Quart Stackable Gasket Box w/ Latching Lid 6-Pack $46 $67 free shipping more The next best on this 6-pack is $59 at Amazon, and substantially more outside that.

Others, like smart lights, can be so much more helpful if you take the time to add some customizations. For example, you can schedule them to turn on with a warm glow at 10% brightness when it's time to wake up. The enjoyment you get from your smart home device depends on how well it operates.

As a side note, Linux 5.10 was released in December 2020 , and it\u2019s scheduled to be supported until December 2026. RT-Thread 5.0 RTOS also supports the Allwinner T536 (first GitHub repository from Forlinx), and I assume it\u2019s running on the 600 MHz E907 RISC-V core rather than the Cortex-A55 cores.

Read Time: 6 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Katty Perry is set to blast off on April 14 on a self-driving private rocket by Blue Origin. Texas: Six women, including popstar Katty Perry is set to blast off on April 14 on a self-driving private rocket by Blue Origin, the company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for a joyride to space that is expected to last all of 11 minutes. \"I think I'm gonna sing, I've got to sing in space!\" Perry said in a new post on Instagram. Perry (40) will be joined by broadcast journalist Gayle King (70) Lauren Sanchez (55) who is also Bezos' fiancee, Aisha Bowe (38), a former NASA rocket scientist, Amanda Nguyen (33), a bioastronautics research scientist; and Kerianne Flynn, a movie producer. It will be the 11th human flight for Blue Origin. The mission known as NS-31 on a reusable rocket is set to lift off from Van Horn in Texas and will feature the first all-female crewed spaceflight in 60 years. The first woman to travel in space was Soviet-era cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, in a 1963 solo mission when she orbited Earth as part of the Vostok 6 mission that lasted just under three days. In a post on her Instagram account, Perry wrote a day ago, \"I've dreamed of going to space for 15 years and tomorrow that dream becomes a reality.....I am SO honoured to be alongside 5 other incredible and inspiring women as we become the first ever all female flight space crew!\" The singer's video accompanying the message showed a peek from inside the capsule that will take her to space.It includes large windows from where she and her crewmates will be able to take in the views from space. Named after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American in space, the New Shepard vehicle is touted as Blue Origin's \"fully reusable, suborbital rocket system built for human flight from the beginning.\" The company said that the rocket will accelerate more than three times the speed of sound and will take the passengers just above the Karman line, an invisible boundary at an altitude of 62 miles that is widely accepted as the edge of space. The crew will experience about four minutes of weightlessness then descend using parachutes and land in the Texas desert. The rocket is autonomous and designed to fly to and from suborbital space without a pilot on board. \"We envision a future where millions of people will live and work in space with a single-minded purpose: to restore and sustain Earth, our blue origin,\" states Blue Origin which states that its mission is that of \"building a road to Space for the benefit of Earth.\" Jeff Bezos the founder of Blue Origin, went to space on a New Shepard flight in July 2021, the spacecraft's first mission with a crew. Actor William Shatner, who played Captain James T Kirk of the Starship Enterprise was among the first rocket of Jeff Bezos company in the year 2022 at the age of 90. Blue Origin is a competitor for Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, which uses its Dragon space capsule to carry crew and cargo to the International Space Station. Sanchez worked with fashion designers to redo the look for the all-female flight crew \"that brings spice to space\" according to a report in Fox News. The dark blue jumpsuit-style ensembles carry a NASA patch, a patch with their last name, and the Blue Origin logo on one arm. In an interview with The New York Times, Sanchez said \"Usually, you know, these suits are made for a man. Then they get tailored to fit a woman.\" She told the NYT that she reached out to Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, the co-founders of the brand Monse, who are also creative directors of Oscar de la Renta, to rework the look. \"I think the suits are elegant, but they also bring a little spice to space,\" Sanchez told the news outlet and added what Katy Perry had told her, \"We're putting the 'a--' in astronaut.\" Sanchez was cited telling Elle magazine that she chose her fellow crew members because each had \"proven their ability to inspire others\". She said all the women will be able to spread the word on what they felt like during the trip, and also expand on ideas of what the next generation of space explorers will look like. Actress Olivia Munn had expressed her concerns about the mission, questioning its purpose and the vast resources being spent on it. \"I'm not sure what they're doing up there,\" Munn said while guest co-hosting 'Today With Jenna & Friends.' \"There are so many other things that are important in the world right now. It's a lot of money to go to space, and there are people who can't even afford basic necessities,\" she said, as per E! News. Munn questioned the motives behind the mission, asking, \"What's the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it's a bit gluttonous. Space exploration was meant to further our knowledge and help mankind. What are they going to do up there that will make a difference?\" as per E! News. However, Sanchez and Bowe have defended the mission, emphasizing the importance of representation and storytelling. \"All of these women are storytellers in their own right,\" Sanchez said in an interview, adding, \"They're going to go up to space and be able to spread what they felt in different ways,\" as per E! News. Bowe added, \"This representation matters. It's people seeing themselves and being able to show up authentically in their careers in the future.\" The mission of Blue Origin,it said is learning to harness materials found in space to enable future exploration including \"using lunar dust to ultimately produce solar power systems, power transmission cables, and oxygen for propellants and human consumption, as well as developing systems to identify water ice on the Moon's south pole for extraction of hydrogen to refuel landers.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

If you thought I was talking about Air Force One , an all-time great \u201890s film , you\u2019d only be partly right. Instead, I\u2019m talking about G20 , the new Viola Davis -led action thriller that just landed on the 2025 movie schedule . Let me tell you something\u2026 G20 , which you can watch with an Amazon Prime subscription right now, feels like a throwback to a long-gone era and gives off the same vibes as the 1997 thriller where Harrison Ford uttered the famous line, \u201cGet off my plane!\u201d The movie doesn\u2019t go that far, but it certainly comes extremely close, in the best possible way. Amazon Prime Video Channel Add-On Deals As well as Prime Video's 20,000+ hours of movies like G20 and TV shows like The Boys , you can also customize your subscription with channel add-ons. This includes subscriptions like STARZ, Max, and AMC+. Better still, you can sometimes get deals on these channels you wouldn't otherwise get directly. Currently, for example, you can save and bundle STARZ and Britbox together for $14.99 a month after your 7-day free trial. You can also get Max and Cinemax for just $21.99 a month (down from $26.99). View Deal (Image credit: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime) I Realized That This Movie Is Pretty Much Air Force One, In A Good Way I will admit, I didn\u2019t have high hopes for G20 before pressing play. Though the idea of Viola Davis in an action movie seemed promising, the straight-to-streaming release didn\u2019t have me all too excited. But, then I started watching Davis\u2019 U.S. President Danielle Sutton rise to the occasion and realized that this is pretty much Air Force One , in a good way. I\u2019m not going to spoil anything for anyone, but G20 is like if Air Force One took place at an international summit at a hotel in South Africa instead of a plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. A lot of the setup, story beats, and ridiculous action sequences are cut from the same cloth, and they all work. Is this the best action movie of all time ? No, but like my experience with Flight Risk earlier this year, this throwback thriller was a blast to watch. (Image credit: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime) Viola Davis As A No-Nonsense And Butt-Kicking President Was Up There With Harrison Ford's Commander-In-Chief Not only is Viola Davis an EGOT winner , she\u2019s also something of a badass action star , as she quickly proved in G20 . Whether she was shooting random unnamed goons, taking fools out in close-quarter combat, or pulling off some stuff you\u2019d expect from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jason Statham , her Danielle Sutton goes all out. She\u2019s right up there with Harrison Ford\u2019s James Marshall in Air Force One . I can\u2019t tell you how awesome it was seeing the actress, who killed it in movies like The Help , Doubt , and Fences, wear a red dress with matching sneakers and take on a massive terrorist group. Similar to Marshall in the 1997 classic, Sutton takes matters into her own hands and continually puts others before her while she takes care of business. (Image credit: Ilze Kitshoff/Prime) Antony Starr's Villain Was So Over-The-Top And Felt Like A Wild Throwback Antony Starr, who fans of The Boys will recognize as the vile Homelander, shows up in G20 as a wild, over-the-top, and unforgettable villain, Edward Rutledge. Nothing new for a man who loves playing messed-up characters , but his take on the leader of the AWAKE terrorist outfit is so much fun to watch. CINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Similar to Gary Oldman \u2019s Ivan Korshunov in Air Force One , this big bad is honestly one of the most engaging parts of the movie and Starr\u2019s performance has this electric quality to it that you can\u2019t stop watching. Though his motives are very modern, Rutledge\u2019s tactics, motivations, and personality would feel right at home in a \u201890s action flick. All in all, G20 is worth watching, especially if you are fond of action thrillers from yesteryear. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get a sequel, but I\u2019ll be there if the day comes. TOPICS Philip Sledge Content Writer Philip grew up in Louisiana (not New Orleans) before moving to St. Louis after graduating from Louisiana State University-Shreveport. When he's not writing about movies or television, Philip can be found being chased by his three kids, telling his dogs to stop barking at the mailman, or chatting about professional wrestling to his wife. Writing gigs with school newspapers, multiple daily newspapers, and other varied job experiences led him to this point where he actually gets to write about movies, shows, wrestling, and documentaries (which is a huge win in his eyes). If the stars properly align, he will talk about For Love Of The Game being the best baseball movie of all time.

CEO David Zaslav Is the Last Hollywood Mogul Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission. Illustration: Cold War Steve; Photos: Getty Images, Courtesy Everett Collection, Warner Bros. This article was featured in One Great Story , New York \u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. David Zaslav is a member of a regular Zoom call that includes Howard Stringer , 83, who once ran Sony; Tom Freston , 79, who once ran Viacom; Walter Isaacson , 72, who once ran CNN and Time magazine; Graydon Carter , 75, who once ran Vanity Fair ; Richard Cohen , 84, retired from his longtime column at the Washington Post ; Nick Pileggi, 92, the GoodFellas screenwriter; Ken Auletta, 83, the Boswell to a former generation of media moguls; and Kenny Lerer, 73, the financial backer and co-founder of HuffPost , now retired from his investment business. At 65, Zaslav, currently the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, is the youngest person on the call. The group has met in some form and with a shifting cast for many years. At Zaslav\u2019s suggestion, it solidified into quite a defined club and a regular appointment during COVID \u2014 10 a.m. every Friday. Health issues form a subtext here, though, given that these are all men of a certain age and sensibility; the full details of, for instance, their trips to the Mayo Clinic might not be directly addressed. It is a social gathering, a \u201cshooting the shit\u201d opportunity in one member\u2019s more or less humblebrag, a kibitzing among men who have known the same people and shared much the same professional dramas over decades. But the impossible-to-ignore friction in the group is that while few members, if any, in the characterization of one of them, \u201cget up in the morning anymore and go to the office\u201d or indeed have formal jobs of any sort, David Zaslav , whose ear they have, holds a significant share of the remaining power of the once all-powerful media business \u2014 their business. He is in a sense the last member of this generation to have his hand firmly on the wheel (74-year-old Bob Iger, at Disney, is always on the cusp of retirement) and, for the others in the group, their last brush with the era of the mogul, such as it remains \u2014 the age in which they grew up. \u201cDavid is the CEO,\u201d says one member of the group, many members of which themselves were not too long ago CEOs. \u201cHe just acts like a CEO. He talks like a CEO. He asks the questions. He moves the discussion along.\u201d Members demur about how much they might influence Zaslav, but all of these men have singularly focused for their entire professional lives on many of Zas\u2019s daily issues and certainly believe they have achieved some sagaciousness. Kenny Lerer bought Martha Stewart\u2019s house in East Hampton so he could be across the street from his friend Zas, who had bought adman Jerry Della Femina\u2019s house; Zas and Kenny, who was once Michael Milken\u2019s PR man and, ex officio, advises his friend Zas on PR as well as other matters, speak to or see each other three or more times a week. Graydon Carter, showing his friend the social ropes shortly after Zas\u2019s takeover of Warner, convinced him to co-sponsor, along with Carter\u2019s newsletter, Airmail, and pay for the bulk of an over-the-top party in 2023 during the Cannes Film Festival at the Hotel du Cap, with, as it happened, unfortunate PR fallout for Zas (somewhat like, given the state of the industry, fiddling while Rome burned). Nick Pileggi\u2019s new movie, The Alto Knights, after being turned down at other studios, was made, at Zas\u2019s behest, at Warner Bros. Zaslav, whose company recently posted unexpectedly strong earnings (followed almost immediately by the personal embarrassment of dire numbers for the Pileggi film), is a man charged with leading the media business into the future, navigating the business out of its cultural, generational, and technological obsolescence. It is a business, said Andy Lack , a close Zas friend and the former head of NBC News , that \u201cwe won\u2019t recognize in five years\u201d and that, more immediately, faces the wrath and retribution of Donald Trump for its news division\u2019s slights against him \u2014 in WBD\u2019s case, CNN. And yet, as the world turns, here is David Zaslav regularly convening a brain trust of white men, all of them New York liberals, with an average age of 80. Their Zoom call as a metaphor for being stuck in time \u2014 another time \u2014 is, in the view of the group, an inevitable, if churlish, interpretation. Yet couldn\u2019t it also be seen (if it needs to be seen in any way), some of them wonder, as a reminder of the values and sensibility that have for so long shaped the business \u2014 as an anchor, in fast-shifting waters, for Zaslav? Couldn\u2019t it? In 2023, David Zaslav co-hosted a bash at the Cannes Film Festival that, in the words of a friend, became an \u201cunforced error.\u201d Photo: Daniel Paik The gradual decline of the media business has now arguably reached the all-at-once stage. Every aspect of the traditional distribution and revenue model is in some form, however extended, of extremis. The long sunset of network television and movie studios has more recently been joined with a new swiftness by cable television, whose 45 percent margins, supporting the industry for a generation, have now marched off a cliff. Against this background, in 2020 when he was merely the head of Discovery with some of the highest profit margins in the cable industry \u2014 but with cable\u2019s primacy already clearly over \u2014 Zaslav, whom his friend Lack characterized as \u201cnot sentimental but a bit of a romantic,\u201d bought the Hollywood home of Robert Evans, the legendary Paramount chief who oversaw the making of The Godfather, Chinatown, and Love Story. (Hollywood nostalgist and Zoom participant Graydon Carter, who helped immortalize Evans in his documentary The Kid Stays in the Picture and has just published a memoir, When the Going Was Good, a paean to the media past, was a key broker in the purchase.) It was a hard-to-miss reach for the symbols and tropes of Old Hollywood status, for which Zaslav was duly skewered (he bought the home, he tells me, for its \u201carchitectural value\u201d). A year later, Zaslav announced that Discovery, his much smaller company, was taking over WarnerMedia, the former Time Warner \u2014 long the dominant company in the media business (which AT&T, in some dumbfounding effort, had bought and then, at a loss to manage it, almost immediately regretted buying). The deal \u2014 appearing to be a case of the dog catching the bus \u2014 put Zaslav under a dark cloud of debt. But it gave him the Warner Bros. name, which he promptly restored, rebranding his company as Warner Bros. Discovery, and put him in Jack Warner\u2019s office (and, not incidentally, Kevin Tsujihara\u2019s office, Barry Myers\u2019s office, Bob Daly\u2019s office, and Ted Ashley\u2019s office \u2014 quite a lineup of Hollywood history) and behind Jack Warner\u2019s desk, which Zaslav hauled out of storage. Members of the Zoom call who find themselves in L.A. get a special tour of the Warner lot and glimpses into the bedrooms and back stairway where the Brothers Warner could nap during the day or do what moguls once did to the willing and unwilling (likely, too, across the selfsame desk). There is hardly a more dismal characterization than \u201clegacy media.\u201d Few ambitious types want to admit to being in it, and some of the biggest modern fortunes have been made upending it. Jeffrey Bewkes, the CEO of Time Warner who engineered a top-of-the-market deal to sell his company to AT&T in 2018, is held in awe by his shareholders for getting out in time. Eight months later, seeing the writing on the wall, Rupert Murdoch followed suit, selling the bulk of his company to Disney. Recently, Comcast announced a plan to spinoff most of its cable-television properties into a new company temporarily called \u201cSpinCo.\u201d but more colloquially, and perhaps accurately within the industry, \u201cShitCo.\u201d Still, legacy media is exactly what David Zaslav is doubling down on. For better or worse, his is a theory of the case: The media business has consistently weathered transition after transition, and there is always a survivor, so why can\u2019t he be the last man standing? Technology comes and goes while entertainment and sports are forever. Aren\u2019t they? Zas rises on a predawn schedule, to which he credits no small amount of his success (he says he built his relationship with Si and Donald Newhouse, major Discovery shareholders, because they too got up early), and, most days, after shooting off articles he reads in the New York Times or The Wall Street Journal to his staff and friends, starts out for his office at 6:30 or 7 a.m. While walking from his home on Central Park West (Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s former apartment, which Zaslav bought for $25 million), where he lives with his wife of 37 years, Pam, whom he met at synagogue at the age of 12 (they have three grown children \u2014 and Zas\u2019s mother is still alive), he\u2019ll make rat-a-tat checking-in phone calls, an hour and a half of walking and talking, down to his office on 19th Street. He is likely to speak to a variety of WBD executives, \u201cgetting the plays for the day, how do we move the ball,\u201d but also regularly to Kenny Lerer, David Geffen (whose house, like Lerer\u2019s, is down the street from Zaslav\u2019s in East Hampton), and former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein as well as the most significant investor in WBD, John Malone (speaking \u201coften not about business, just what\u2019s going on in the world\u201d). He talks too with other machers and gossips he happily lists, including Tom Freston; Allen Grubman, the entertainment lawyer and fixer (also an East Hampton neighbor); Bobby Kotick, the video-game billionaire; Brian Grazer, the billionaire film producer; Jason Blum, the horror-film impresario (and a hopeful one-day billionaire); Len Blavatnik, the Russian oligarch turned international businessman with extensive music and entertainment interests; and Richard Plepler, the former HBO chief (Zas did not, in our conversation, have any women on his call sheet). The media business may be among the last that still burns the phones, its true players dialing as fast as kids text. Indeed, at the top, it\u2019s still a business of talkers \u2014 hardly anybody ever opens a computer. They just talk, have always just talked. It\u2019s a constant conversation, a perpetual Barney Greengrass breakfast, part of a work-life continuum rather than the more au courant work-life balance (indeed, ever piercing the bubble of subordinates\u2019 weekends). The best talker, or at least the most indefatigable, wins. Arguably, this existential struggle is not just to preserve the industry\u2019s profits but the tribal rituals of men (with few exceptions men) who have grown up in it. That might seem, for all the obvious reasons, to raise contemptuous eyebrows. But also, for better or worse, what is being preserved, in the view of many people in the highest show-business strata, is the nature, the very DNA, of entertainment, at least as we have known it. It would not be, among these men, such a great leap to see the fate of the media business as a cultural showdown between the younger, self-serious, wildly overconfident, flatly literal, bad-taste Midwest tech bros in their bid for the attention of the American (or world) audience and the old Jewish guys of New York and L.A. who have for so long in their striving and jokes and neuroses, dominated the business \u2014 that\u2019s entertainment. You could as well see Zaslav and his old-guy circle as a bulwark against all the too-liberal (arguably unprofitable) efforts of an angry younger-demo media hoi polloi to culturally transform the business (Zas is particularly proud of his early decision at Warner to cancel the release of the $90 million Batgirl, which featured a trans actor). Also, you can see Zaslav\u2019s rise in the business as part of an indefatigable courtship of his media betters and forebears. It is no small point that, within this circle \u2014 this deeply tribal community of show-business men, rich ones \u2014 Zas is regarded with great, one-of-us affection. Of course, Zas \u2014 call it the Zas contradiction \u2014 is not really a show-business guy. He\u2019s a numbers guy. Less Robert Evans than Robert Evans\u2019s accountant (still, though, a show-business accountant, \u201cNot artist friendly but artist aware and adjacent,\u201d in one producer\u2019s description). He may hold in awe the true figures of the media and show-business world, but he would fire them and cut their projects in a New York minute. This has created, in the first year or two of his moguldom, a rearguard action of resentment and resistance within the industry \u2014 hence a largely unfriendly narrative (drowned out by chants of \u201cPay your writers\u201d in a speech he made during the writers strike; hoisted for a critical article in GQ that suspiciously disappeared just as the GQ editor was developing a movie at Warner Bros.; ridiculed for his party at Cannes, where a phalanx of aides and security people rushed out to light the way after Zaslav took a small red-carpet stumble on the Hotel du Cap steps \u2014 \u201cunforced errors,\u201d in the words of one Zoom-call member). Certainly, the takeover of Warner shone the media\u2019s own unremitting light on him and on the projects and personnel he has cut to pay down the company\u2019s whopping debt while taking for himself a whopping paycheck, indeed one of the biggest in the media industry \u2014 $52 million in 2024, $50 million in 2023, $40 million in 2022, all on top of a windfall of stock options in 2021 (around $200 million) prior to the Warner deal closing, amounts, in the face of the company\u2019s declining value, even his friends seem embarrassed by. Per one producer, \u201cHe is an avatar of the death of the middle class in Hollywood. In the old days, everybody did well. Now, all those people in the middle have been squeezed. Zas, though, is doing better than ever.\u201d Beyond mogul economics, the criticism has a quotient of snobbery: The Brooklyn-born, state-university-educated Zaslav, a \u201cvery un-Tiffany kind of person\u201d per a Tiffany-type producer, is a media upstart and wannabe who is fucking with, and fucking up, HBO, the new Tiffany Network. Zas, reaching for the mogul mantle, is certainly no Rupert Murdoch, nor is he the wry, ironic, brainy Bewkes or a Bob Evans\u2013type showman and golden-gut hitmaker. Zas can seem more like a sales manager who has memorized the PowerPoint deck (\u201cWe are on offense \u2026 We got a leadership team that is on mission \u2026\u201d). He is famous for his wide-of-the-mark efforts to dress for the mogul part, wearing, when I visited him recently in his suburban-looking office on 19th Street, a blue blazer over a hoodie over a T-shirt. His performance at the company\u2019s virtual town hall after the L.A. fires, a video of which his comms team offered me, was more halting and unsure than the man who had it under control, and whom Hollywood could gratefully turn to, who he likely wanted to appear to be. \u201cHe\u2019s a very effective manager and strategist in these businesses,\u201d said Blankfein about the hodgepodge of cable, movie, and streaming plays that uncomfortably compose modern media (\u201cwhich, by the way, are terrible businesses,\u201d Blankfein added). Zaslav\u2019s comms team has put Blankfein on the phone with me to push back against what Zas seems to feel may be my suggestion that he is less than a true mogul. \u201cBut does that mean he should walk among the giants of Hollywood? It wouldn\u2019t occur to me to put him there,\u201d Blankfein said, meaning, I infer, that moguldom may not be the most relevant skill set for this moment in media time. One member of the Zaslav Zoom call, professing personal affection for Zas, also expressed surprise that \u201ca guy like Zas\u201d had become among the most important people in the media business, by which he seemed to impute (putting aside the paycheck) an uncharacteristic normalcy for a mogul, a lasting middle-classness. Or, as another longtime observer put it, \u201cDavid has made a career out of being underestimated.\u201d Zaslav\u2019s early career, along with being an immersion course in the dense legal, logistical, technical, and personality tapestry of the nascent cable industry, was deep training in the art of dealing with the big man \u2014 which he surely hopes to be but is not quite yet. In 1986, Zaslav left his job as a junior associate at a large New York law firm and joined the counsel\u2019s office at NBC, then owned by GE and wholly dominated by Jack Welch, the GE CEO who, with only minor exaggeration, was largely regarded as among the best businessmen who had ever walked the earth (similarly, he is now regarded, with only minor exaggeration, as among the worst). Welch created a generation of media executives in the GE \u2014 that is, in his own personal \u2014 mode. \u201cAfter years spent working with Welch and presenting to him \u2026 you start to think like him,\u201d Zas says proudly. Zaslav was hardly unique among executives at NBC in embracing the Jack Welch way, but he seemed to have a special taste for it, requiring quite a leap for a Jewish boy into GE\u2019s macho, tight-lipped, towel-snapping, Catholic-boy culture. Zas became a favorite of both Welch (\u201cone of my very best friends\u201d) and Welch\u2019s top lieutenant, Bob Wright, with frequent references to both men continuing to pepper his conversations and, as almost a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 bullet, the reminder that he was a pallbearer at Welch\u2019s funeral. At John Malone\u2019s invitation, Zaslav left NBC in 2006. Holding NBC\u2019s major-cable portfolio, Zaslav had had many dealings over the years with Malone, an early cable-system mogul. While making vast profits off the business, Malone has not shown any discernible interest in media influence, power, glamour, stars, or stories. He is an engineer by training, quite a cerebral one \u2014 media is for him an engineering, rather than an operating, problem, a strategy of spinoffs, debt, and more or less opaque financial arrangements \u2014 with a trader\u2019s keen sensitivity to when markets are moving, telephony to cable to broadband. In 2005, when Malone\u2019s Liberty Media spun out Discovery into an independent company, though one still controlled by Malone, Zaslav, with his long relationship with Malone, became his choice for CEO. Meaning that Zaslav, even with the vast sprawl of his mass-entertainment products, principally has an audience of one: The 84-year-old Malone, who has just announced his retirement as WBD chairman but remains the most significant shareholder, is perhaps the last person in the media business who people still assume knows what he is doing. Which gives Zaslav quite a runway \u2014 Zas must know what he is doing because John Malone knows what he\u2019s doing, right? But while Malone famously gives great authority and autonomy and an open checkbook to his closest prot\u00e9g\u00e9-lieutenants, he is also like a greater force of nature: If tectonic plates shift in Malone\u2019s crustal sensitivity, billions of dollars in media assets could, overnight, be reordered. In that sense, Zaslav is trying to outrun not only his competitors but John Malone\u2019s timeline (a shifting one). Indeed, the 2022 deal to buy Warner might well have been due as much to Malone\u2019s desire to sell Discovery \u2014 but finding no buyer, he merged it into what was, in fact, a spinoff of Warner by AT&T, whose shareholders retain a large interest. Management passed to the Discovery side, making Zaslav the CEO and, in some sense, the accidental mogul. The Warner Bros. television and film business once made $3 billion a year \u2014 last year, it made $1.7 billion. AT&T paid more than $100 billion for Time Warner. Three years later, when AT&T spun the company off to Discovery, its valuation was roughly 40 percent lower. Post-merger, WBD started trading at $25 a share \u2014 at a $60 billion value. Now, says Zas\u2019s friend (and one of his biggest individual shareholders \u2014 30 million, he says bullishly) David Geffen, who was also enlisted by WBD to offer me his Zas endorsement, it\u2019s at around $9 a share (and has gone as low as $7), even combined with Discovery. \u201cWhat a bargain!\u201d That\u2019s the bracing reality that both Malone and Zaslav wake up to every morning \u2014 a curse or an opportunity. The assets of the media business circa 2025 are, in effect, all for sale. Shortly after Comcast announced its ShitCo. spinoff of MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and the Golf Channel, along with its digital fancies Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow, and SportsEngine, WBD followed suit with a reorganization plan of its own, separating its streaming (HBO, Max, and Discovery+) and content-creating (studio and library) businesses from its \u201cglobal linear networks\u201d \u2014 including TNT, TBS, the Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Animal Planet, and CNN, it\u2019s \u201cShitCo.\u201d In other words, escape is on everybody\u2019s mind. And getting out at the highest price may be, given all, the most reasonable move for John Malone. Zas, in the mission of his life, is determined not to let that happen. The Zaslav play \u2014 now, finally, after three years, out of the box and front and center in the company\u2019s messaging \u2014 is a simple and, to some extent, clear Johnny-come-lately one: Take HBO, the Time Warner gold-standard entertainment asset, and infuse it with a miscellany of other broad-appeal content (that is, basic-cable stuff, or \u201ctonnage\u201d in programming talk), and, risking extreme brand confusion, create an international streaming service called Max that might go head-to-head with Netflix. Or even take on network television: The Pitt, a medical drama with the old ER star Noah Wyle, is a 15-episode series with another season just commissioned for next year (no precious, streaming-style few episodes every few years). \u201cThe best storytelling content on a global platform,\u201d Zas pronounces as his strategy. In any conversation with Zaslav, he uses the words storytelling and storyteller \u2014 the media is the \u201cstorytelling business\u201d \u2014 to an all-purpose excess that is surely confusing to actual storytellers. What is meant here, it seems, in a psychic sense, is a connection to the long history of Hollywood and a way to emphasize, which WBD execs do, \u201cWe are not in the widgets business\u201d \u2014 a dig at the tech people (though widgets are the opposite of digits). But also meant is the dollars-and-cents value of the libraries the media business owns and the future, even perpetual, exploitability of that IP. And further, in the blanket use of storytelling as a virtue and an idiom, is the new fungibility of media, neither wedded to theaters, particular screens, or any defined form. We are not in the movie business, we are not in the television business, we are certainly not in the publishing business (Time Warner jettisoned its magazine company \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 in 2014). It\u2019s analog, it\u2019s digital, it\u2019s news, it\u2019s docudrama, it\u2019s fantasy, it\u2019s games, it\u2019s a podcast, it\u2019s a series. That is, content \u2014 that mulch of video, audio, digital, and written culture \u2014 with storytelling the newer, softer word. And we \u2014 WBD \u2014 are the biggest producers of it. And the best at it (four Apple TV+ hits are produced by Warner Bros. \u2014 Bad Monkey, Shrinking, Ted Lasso, and Presumed Innocent \u2014 notes Zaslav, making the point that the tech community lacks serious creative chops). \u201cAnd in the end, that\u2019s what wins, the best content.\u201d But best in media-business language does not necessarily mean best in a creative sense \u2014 rather, it is closer to most, and all things to all people , and hits . \u201cWe have the greatest writers and storytellers \u2014 Chuck Lorre, J. J. Abrams, Bill Lawrence, Mindy Kaling \u2014 we have 80 of those people,\u201d says Zaslav, as though to add them like weapons to his soldiers on the field. This is the up-to-the-minute media dream to supply content anywhere, anytime, on any device. That\u2019s the central Zaslav proposition, to make Max a must-have worldwide streamer and with him \u2014 deeply committed to the lore and thrall of the media business but at the same time a hard-hearted bottom-line executive \u2014 the man to do it. This has so far involved, \u201con our Max journey,\u201d as J. B. Perrette, WBD\u2019s streaming chief who has worked with Zas for 25 years, calls it, a two-year platform build-out \u2014 which can also be read as being waylaid and stalled for two years \u2014 an international dealmaking spree, and a deep investment in big new franchises. It has also involved an industry sense that this has come at the expense of HBO, a downgrade in its stature and resources. (\u201cThey entirely misunderstood the HBO brand,\u201d says one former studio executive. \u201cThey thought it stood for linear-subscription TV while it stood for the highest quality of television available.\u201d) Zaslav seems pained by this but resigned: This is the breaking-eggs phase. And by the way, even if HBO and its vast success and sui generis place in modern entertainment may be part of the linear-television past, in fact, \u201cHBO has never been bigger or more successful,\u201d says Zas. Its longtime management team is still largely in place, and the company vigorously argues for HBO\u2019s continued quality: The Penguin , Hacks , The Last of Us (which was the biggest HBO series since the last season of Game of Thrones ), Succession , and, indeed, The White Lotus , which might reasonably claim to be the moment\u2019s true Zeitgeist hit \u2014 its recent finale was 50 percent bigger than the season before. But at the same time, while HBO might yet be the gold standard, in its mixed messaging, Max (an incomprehensible elevation of the company\u2019s also-ran\u2013never-was Cinemax brand) is the future-looking (and Hail Mary) reboot. On this, the company\u2019s position is wholly bullish: In the past six months, Zaslav says, Max has added 20 million subscribers (it\u2019s actually 19 million) \u2014 \u201cgrowing, accelerating, and profitable and will generate more profit every quarter,\u201d Zaslav emphatically makes the point \u2014 bringing it to a worldwide 117 million yet being in only half of the markets that Netflix, with its 300 million subscribers, is in. Max is growing at a rate that, if sustained (a big if), as it reaches 100 percent penetration will overtake Netflix. And this is before a series of big new franchise investments has come online. The recent announcement of its quarterly results showed nearly $700 million in profits from streaming and direct to consumer. The company\u2019s estimate of $1 billion in 2025 was raised to $1.3 billion. Management has been feverishly circulating a column in Puck \u2014 often a gossipy thorn in Zaslav\u2019s side \u2014 by William Cohan arguing the company has turned the corner by paying down debt and increasing its streaming cash flow. Cohan, echoing the WBD message, extolled the Zaslav strategy of \u201cinternationalizing\u201d Max. And, indeed, it is a certain leap out in front of the loud chorus of the past few years that predicted nothing but a doom spiral. The ceiling, though, may already be fixed. Max\u2019s best hope, if all its dreams come true, may be only to become the sixth streaming service, behind Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, and YouTube. That is better than all the other also-ran streamers but not necessarily good enough to stand alone. It\u2019s in danger, in other words, of becoming no more than another piece on the board, waiting for future media asset builders to determine its future. Even a truly over-the-top success for Max might not do it. The streaming business, which great tech companies can afford to support, at its best produces 20 percent margins, which hardly replace cable\u2019s 45 percent margins that media investors \u2014 like John Malone \u2014 have come to expect. How do you support streaming while keeping investors happy? Can streaming, even with increased subscribers, higher prices, and international reach, ever perform at the level of the old network mass-reach and mass-advertising model or the cable bundle, dual subscriber, and ad-rev stream? Indeed, how do you hold investors\u2019 belief in the very idea of a media company? Well, there is no answer. There is no model \u2014 with the possible exception of Disney with, uniquely, its theme parks; its Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm franchises; and dominance in the family market \u2014 of a media company that can, at this point in delivery-system time, promise sustainable growth. David Zaslav may be looking forward to a streaming afterlife and a place at the table among the streaming giants, but he is still, alas, and even principally, in the ShitCo. cable business. And yet \u2026 the trick of the ever\u2013transitioning media business has always been to manage decline while you pray for better days. Technology companies only exist as of today; the media business is a tension between past, present, and future. The past doesn\u2019t ever go away, television didn\u2019t wipe out radio, cable didn\u2019t wipe out network, streaming won\u2019t wipe out terrestrial \u2014 you just have to be fast enough and ruthless enough to adjust your management of it. While Zaslav may from a certain angle look like a parody of a wannabe media mogul, and not necessarily a very good parody, there is at the same time a view that Zaslav, fairly rare among the mogul set, possesses a level of business self-awareness, an understanding that, together with his mogul dreams, his day job is being a real nuts-and-bolts guy on a tight timetable. His circle, even without prodding, notes his prodigious work ethic \u2014 \u201cpragmatic, straightforward, straight shooting,\u201d says Zas\u2019s friend Bobby Kotick, the gaming billionaire, delegated to offer an encomium \u2014 while brushing past his episodes of ostentation and glamour grabs. \u201cHe really is not an asshole,\u201d defends another friend. As Zaslav works his present streaming strategy, seeking to talk about nothing else but, he is, too, less publicly, deeply attentive to the cable past. For one thing, cable\u2019s profits, while bleak in the future, are still strong in the present, and Zaslav\u2019s astute management of them has, in a surprise to the industry, helped bring down what seemed to be WBD\u2019s unsustainable debt to quite reasonable levels. What\u2019s more, ShitCo. may now present quite an opportunity. The FCC has had under Obama and Biden an antagonistic view of media mergers. The Trump age opens the possibility of creating a big industry utility of shit \u2014 a massive combination of cable properties to maximize efficiencies, margins, and leverage with cable providers. It may obviously seem to be a competitive disadvantage that, while the technology business builds the future, the media business is more often than not surprised by it. Yet that, in a way, is the nature of media \u2014 of the Zeitgeist, of a hit, and of show business. If you can\u2019t roll with it, you shouldn\u2019t be on the boat (\u201cGetting to the other side of the river\u201d is how a weary-sounding Casey Bloys, the 20-year HBO veteran, now CEO, puts it). The future, in the traditional media model, always holds unknown fortune, whether that be the conversion to DVDs that supported a generation or the wild margins in the cable bundle or \u2026 WBD\u2019s Harry Potter series, which the company is massively investing in and is billing as the biggest launch in streaming history. Or its other big number, Superman (the first of a dozen superheroish movies slated over the next ten years to try to turn Warner\u2019s ownership of DC Comics into something like Disney\u2019s gift-that-keeps-giving Marvel and make the studio, just like Disney, a repeat franchise machine). Zaslav is putting a lot of hope in Harry Potter and Superman \u2014 oh, and Cat in the Hat as a central piece of its kids\u2019 build-out \u2014 as both part of the branding makeover for Max (not your father\u2019s HBO) and wishes for an endless franchise future. Hits, at least temporarily, solve all problems. This may seem like a slim reed, but in the past, it has always worked for somebody. Why not Zas? And it\u2019s not as though anyone else has a better plan. Media mogul is not necessarily a job too many people want anymore and not necessarily a job that truly exists (even if the paychecks still do). It\u2019s a cautious industry now and a stripped-down one. What is a media mogul compared with Musk, Zuckerberg, or Bezos? (In the case of David Ellison, who is buying Paramount Global with his father Larry Ellison\u2019s multi-hundred-billion-dollar fortune, what is a media mogul compared with the coddled child of a tech titan?) But Zaslav wants the job, arguably may appear to want it too much, and believes in it, which, given how many people seem to want nothing to do with it, is quite a significant stake in the ground. In our conversation in his New York office \u2014 leather couch, re-created exposed-brick walls, and pictures of the Beatles and Hendrix \u2014 Zas is vastly more earnest than flashy, concentrating hard on the details of how he\u2019s going to lead his business over its complicated hurdles. This may seem like his more natural place: David Zaslav, the office guy. He works earnestly, if somewhat less convincingly, at trying to be the other thing, too \u2014 power broker, nabob, kahuna. But he is still the office guy who, miraculously, found himself sitting in the seat, and can\u2019t believe it, and certainly doesn\u2019t want to get out of it \u2014 its existential condition be damned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be doing this stuff if I were him, but guess what, he loves it!\u201d says his friend Blankfein. Moguldom, even if Zas is an unlikely mogul, is what he\u2019s trying to preserve and restore. And he is playing the part \u2014 or learning it. (In the new Apple+ series The Studio, Seth Rogen says he modeled the studio overlord, a rapacious moron played by Bryan Cranston, on Zaslav.) Indeed, every studio, including Warner, had passed on Zoom-call member Nick Pileggi\u2019s script about Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, The Alto Knights. Pileggi is a beloved figure in the entertainment business by virtue of his contributions to the industry-staple organized-crime drama and mythmaking and his marriage to Nora Ephron. In today\u2019s fraught world, where any green-light demands consensus, Zaslav \u2014 in an example of old-school mogul behavior not seen in many years \u2014 proudly pushed the film into production. Peculiarly or meaningfully, the project has been in development since 1974. Irwin Winkler was the producer then with Michael Cimino signed on as director and James Toback as screenwriter \u2014 but then, in a footnote of ancient Hollywood history, it was put into turnaround when Alan Ladd Jr. took over the Twentieth Century Fox film division. Irwin Winkler, at 93, is still the film\u2019s producer, recruiting in his long, heroic effort to make the film for his 92-year-old writer, Pileggi; Barry Levinson, at 82, is the director; and Robert De Niro, at 81, is the star, playing both Costello and Genovese. Prior to the film\u2019s disastrous $3 million opening last month, the green-light decision was being touted by some in the industry as both Zaslav\u2019s boldness over committee caution and a return to the great age of Hollywood dramas. Now, in similar mogul fashion, blame is being spread around, with Zaslav disclaiming responsibility and with the expectation that heads, though not Zas\u2019s, will roll. Now The Alto Knight s just confirms the Zaslav strategy: Film drama is dead, and building franchises is film\u2019s future. A Minecraft Movie, in which Warner has a 75 percent interest (Legendary has 25 percent) opened in early April bigger than Barbie \u2014 the biggest movie of the year so far! This too is a key mogul skill: surviving flops. That\u2019s show business (said with a shrug). And who knows? Fifty years from now, someone may pull out the Zaslav desk. And a coda. What about \u2026 Trump? In the endless cascade of existential variables in the media business, now Trump! Even if you can will hits into being, and somehow hold together broken business models and achieve new global breakthroughs, now you have to deal with, at some very personal mogul level, Trump. While much of the tech world has decided to meet the Trump phenomenon with obsequiousness, and other media companies are making ignominious deals (at ABC, at CBS), and Comcast, doubtlessly, has a sense of relief that their ShitCo. spinoff includes the lefty MSNBC, David Zaslav remains, uncomfortably, the owner of CNN, Trump\u2019s longtime and consistently most hated media target. This is a confusing place for Zaslav to be because nothing about his career would indicate an interest in news. Nor, in the grand scheme, does CNN seem to be a particularly integral part of his vision for WBD (Zaslav insists it is). In one of his few direct expressions, John Malone has even opined about his distaste for the polarization of cable news, which, awkwardly, is cable news\u2019 bread and butter. One of Zaslav\u2019s earliest decisions in the takeover of Warner Media was not to support CNN chief Jeff Zucker, a Zaslav friend from the NBC days (Zucker was also a Jack Welch favorite). In the interregnum period during the deal with AT&T to take control of Warner, Zucker, accused of a corporate infraction for not reporting his relationship of many years\u2019 standing with a colleague, was ousted in apparent political payback by AT&T enemies. Zaslav\u2019s choice not to save the high-flying Zucker may reasonably be read as an effort to downgrade CNN\u2019s profile and importance. His subsequent appointment of Chris Licht, quite a lightweight, to take over one of the key spots in American news happened without a real search, and Licht\u2019s rule collapsed in about a year. Then Zaslav, again without much of a search, turned to Mark Thompson, the retired CEO of the New York Times, for his reputation as an adult in the room with keen corporate acumen who might be counted on to understand the nuances of the moment. But Zaslav is still stuck not only with a fast-declining business and what can seem like the day-by-day erosion of one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands and all the negative media attention that brings, but because of CNN, he now has Trump as a Damocles potentially threatening the entire WBD business. This is too against the background that Time Warner, in its modern history, has been one of the great liberal-bulwark companies, the true home of the New York and L.A. media elite. Trump might have noticed, or surely will, that one of Zas\u2019s key lieutenants is Robert Gibbs, Obama\u2019s former press secretary. What\u2019s more, everyone on Zaslav\u2019s Zoom call is a liberal Democrat, with a required part of their conversation, after their close reading of the New York Times and the Washington Post, about the daily depredations of Donald Trump. Zaslav, a card-carrying G5 liberal, has sought, as everyone in his circle has, Manhattan cred \u2014 among other things, that has previously included prodigious support for Democrats. And now, as he and John Malone look to trade their way out of the tight spots of the business, they may need Donald Trump. WBD confirmed that a company representative recently reached out to the Trump orbit seeking advice about how the company might advantageously interact with the White House and improve its Trump-age odor. The reported message was to look at the example of Amazon and Jeff Bezos paying Melania Trump $40 million to participate in a documentary about herself. Don Jr. might like a hunting and fishing show on the Discovery Channel, they were told. And that CNN could have more pro-Trump voices \u2014 suggestion provided. Zaslav, who was notably photographed at the U.S. Open in September with Elon Musk , does not, to say the least, seem like a man for a moment that may require a face-off with this president. Zaslav\u2019s neutral, largely meaningless comments about CNN \u2014 \u201cThe most important thing to me \u2026 the metric that is most important to me \u2026 is how trusted is a brand is CNN \u2026 We believe in journalism \u2026 Journalism is fighting for the best version of the truth, as Carl Bernstein would say,\u201d invoking Christiane Amanpour and the tanks rolling into Moscow in 1991 \u2014 may seem to indicate that he is rightly not looking forward to that moment\u2019s coming.

Advertisement In the latest development, President Donald Trump confirmed Wednesday that a potential deal to spin off TikTok\u2019s U.S. assets remains \u201con the table,\u201d despite being temporarily put on hold. \u201cWe have a deal with some very good people, some very rich companies that would do a great job with it, but we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what\u2019s going to happen with China,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The president\u2019s comments came the same day he announced a reversal on his sweeping tariffs, declaring a complete 90-day pause on all the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that had gone into effect at midnight \u2014 with the notable exception of China. In fact, Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 104% to 125% after China announced additional retaliatory measures. This economic pressure on Beijing could further complicate the already delicate TikTok negotiations. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has emerged as a frontrunner in the race to acquire TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations from Chinese parent ByteDance, The New York Times report. At 80, with a fortune estimated at $175 billion, Ellison appears to be assembling a media empire that could rival those of his fellow tech titans. Ellison\u2019s son David is already close to acquiring Paramount in an $8 billion deal, suggesting a coordinated family strategy to gain prominence in the media landscape. Advertisement But the TikTok saga is about much more than one billionaire\u2019s ambitions. It represents a fundamental shift in how wealth, technology, and political influence intersect in America today. When Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X) in 2022, he ripped off the mask of algorithmic neutrality, transforming a mainstream social media platform into his personal megaphone. By forcing his posts to the top of feeds, elevating like-minded voices, and driving critics off the platform, Musk revealed the raw power of ownership. Although algorithmic favoritism had long been suspected across platforms, Musk\u2019s unapologetic approach dispensed with the pretense of neutrality that tech companies had carefully maintained. That lesson wasn\u2019t lost on America\u2019s billionaire class. The feeding frenzy for TikTok \u2014 with bids reportedly coming from Amazon, Blackstone, and even a crypto-backed proposal from OnlyFans founder Tim Stokley \u2014 suggests that many of America\u2019s wealthiest individuals now see social media ownership as essential to their influence. Trump\u2019s role in this process cannot be overstated. After returning to office, the president positioned himself as TikTok\u2019s ultimate decision-maker, despite a law mandating that the app be banned in the U.S. unless ByteDance sold it to an American owner. Advertisement Trump initially signed an executive order extending ByteDance\u2019s deadline by 75 days, and has now pushed it further to June 19, effectively making himself the arbiter of TikTok\u2019s future in America. His escalating tariff war with China \u2014 while offering relief to other trade partners for now \u2014 has created an economic backdrop that makes the TikTok deal inseparable from broader U.S.-China relations. \u201cThe tariffs give us great power to negotiate,\u201d Trump told reporters last week . Trump has remained steadfast in his support of a deal that would keep the app available to its 170 million American users. Most tellingly, when asked about potential buyers for TikTok, Trump previously volunteered: \u201cI\u2019d like Larry to buy it,\u201d referring to Ellison, who has grown increasingly close to the president in recent years. Trump also said he would be open to Musk being the buyer . Not that tariffs are the only hurdle to clear. Senators like Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) have come out against the deal and suggested there would be repercussions if ByteDance was allowed to keep a stake in TikTok after the sale, as some reporting suggests it would . Advertisement \u201cAmerican businesses and investors who want to dip their beaks in the golden TikTok fountain should think twice before giving their money and their good name to Chinese Communists,\u201d Cotton said Wednesday on the Senate floor . \u201cIf the TikTok deal maintains any operational relationship with China, you\u2019ll be stuck with the consequences. Caveat emptor.\u201d If Ellison succeeds in acquiring TikTok and overcoming the legal challenges, America will have completed a remarkable transformation of its media landscape. Just two decades ago, traditional media companies and regulated broadcasters dominated public discourse. Today, a handful of tech billionaires increasingly control what Americans see, read, and discuss. Musk has X. Mark Zuckerberg controls Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and Amazon, the company he founded, has a growing advertising and streaming business. And now Ellison may soon add TikTok to a family portfolio that could include Paramount\u2019s film studios, CBS, and MTV. This concentration of media power in the hands of a few extraordinarily wealthy individuals raises profound questions about American democracy. When the ability to reach hundreds of millions of citizens is controlled by people with clear political affiliations and personal agendas, what happens to the marketplace of ideas? Advertisement For American TikTok users, the platform\u2019s entertaining videos and creative content may continue uninterrupted until at least June 19, regardless of who eventually owns it. But beneath that endless scroll, something essential is changing about how information flows in our society. \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://qz.com/tiktok-trade-war-tariffs-china-trump-musk-ellison-1851775775", "source": "Quartz India", "published_at": "2025-04-14T09:00:00"}, {"id": 399, "title": "AQUAPHOR Launches CITY COOL: The Stylish New Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Built-in Filtration for 24 Hours of Cool", "content": "AQUAPHOR Launches CITY COOL: The Stylish New Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Built-in Filtration for 24 Hours of Cool Accessibility Statement Skip Navigation AQUAPHOR - New CITY COOL Stainless Steel Water Filter Bottle Range Press Images: Download LONDON , April 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- AQUAPHOR , a global leader in water filtration, unveils its latest innovation: the CITY COOL Water Filter Bottle .

(Image credit: ESA) At least three old satellites or rocket bodies fall back to Earth every day, a new report reveals. And experts warn that the number of objects returning from space is set to increase, a possible concern for the health of Earth's atmosphere and for the safety of humans on the ground. The Space Environment Report , released by the European Space Agency (ESA) on April 1, found that some 1,200 \"intact objects\" reentered the atmosphere in 2024, in addition to countless space debris fragments. Despite this incessant rain of junk battering the atmosphere, the amount of space debris increased over the course of 2024, with an estimated 45,700 objects larger than 3 inches (10 centimeters) now orbiting the planet. Some of the new junk consists of satellites that naturally reached the end of their lives. You may like ESA's new documentary paints worrying picture of Earth's orbital junk problem Falling space debris is a growing worry for aircraft, new research suggests Related: Kessler Syndrome and the space debris problem But on top of that, several orbital collisions and explosions added at least 3,000 new trackable fragments over the course of 2024. In addition to that, there are currently about 9,300 active spacecraft circling Earth, and further launches continue to add more. The new report \"underlines that space activity has now increased to the point where we are having a real effect on the environment both in space and in the upper atmosphere,\" astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, perhaps the world's leading expert on space debris, told Space.com.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors McDowell was not a part of the team that compiled the report. The astrophysicist, who keeps close tabs on orbital traffic, said that on the day of the interview (April 4), at least three objects had returned from space \u2014 two of SpaceX 's Starlink broadband satellites and a 43-year-old Russian spy satellite called Kosmos 1340. Starlink satellites, according to McDowell, make up the majority of stuff that falls back to Earth these days, and their numbers are only going to grow. \"If SpaceX continues with their plans to expand their Starlink constellation to 30,000 satellites, then we'll be looking at 15 reentries per day,\" McDowell said. \"In addition to that, Amazon is about to start deploying its Kuiper constellation . We're also seeing Chinese megaconstellation projects starting to go up. So, in the next five to 10 years, we will see a corresponding increase in the number of satellites being retired.\" Constellation operators tend to replace their satellites with newer models every five years or so. To prevent further accumulation of space debris, they strive to remove every low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite from its position within five years from its mission's end. As a result of these reentries, however, the amount of space junk burning up in the upper layers of the atmosphere is increasing, which worries some atmospheric scientists. Satellites are mostly made of aluminum, which produces aluminum oxide when burned . Scientists have long known that aluminum oxide can accelerate ozone depletion and contribute to thermal changes in the upper atmosphere. Eloise Marais, a professor in atmospheric chemistry at University College London, described the three-a-day reentry rate as \"an unchartered territory\" and an \"alarming\" trend. \"The impact on the atmosphere is inevitably greater than it has ever been, as more ozone-destroying pollutants, including aluminum oxide, other metal oxides, and gas-phase nitrogen oxides are being added to the atmosphere than ever before,\" said Marais, who leads a team of scientists that's developing an inventory of emissions from satellite reentries and rocket launches. In addition to the potential environmental impacts, the growing number of reentering satellites may increase the risk that some residual debris crashes on Earth, threatening property and human life. McDowell said that, although the risk to humans is currently very low, it will rise with the growing numbers of reentries. \"Most satellites burn up entirely,\" McDowell said. \"Starlinks are specifically designed to completely melt unless they reenter in a non-standard way. But, for example, the Russian Kosmos 1340, which weighed about 2 and a half tons, probably left behind a few chunks reaching the surface of Earth.\" Related: Burned-up space junk pollutes Earth's upper atmosphere, NASA planes find Related stories: \u2014 6 types of objects that could cause space debris apocalypse \u2014 SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket debris creates dramatic fireball over Europe, crashes in Poland (video) \u2014 Scientists call on UN to help solve Earth's space junk problem As most of Earth's surface is either covered with ocean or uninhabited land, the chances of a piece of junk landing on somebody's head are slim. Still, pieces of debris have previously been found close to human settlements. In February of this year, for instance, charred fragments from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket scattered across parts of Poland and Ukraine . And in March 2024, a 4-inch (10 centimeters) shrapnel of melted metal pierced through the roof of a Florida home. The space projectile was later identified as a remnant of a battery pallet thrown out of the International Space Station three years earlier. \"We're rolling the dice every time we have a reentry,\" McDowell said. \"Eventually we're going to get unlucky, and someone is going to get hurt by falling space debris.\" The ESA report stated that, despite efforts to promptly remove old satellites from orbit, there are still too many objects being left behind, creating collision risk. Even if 90% of spacecraft are successfully removed, the number of space debris objects will continue to grow, ESA said in the report. In some parts of LEO, the number of functional satellites now approaches the quantity of space debris objects, the report stated. In addition to the objects larger than 4 inches, which can be tracked from Earth using radars and telescopes, there are about 1.1 million fragments between 0.4 and 4 inches in size and a further 130 million tiny bits smaller than 0.4 inches, according to ESA .

These shorthands describing the dynamics of a novel\u2019s central couple have all had their day in the sun and in SEO. But there\u2019s a new, exciting, micro-trend in both literary and genre fiction reflecting the dramatic culture shifts of the post-Covid era: meet the sentience gap romance. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads There\u2019s been a slow trend away from human lovers in mainstream fiction over the last twenty years. While the brooding vampire lover existed well before 2008, and you can see thousands of examples of cross-mortal couplings across mythologies, Twilight\u2019 s ascendency as a dominant pop culture force issued in a new era of the supernatural romantic lead in the early 2010s. Since then, werewolf, faerie, and dragon love interests have taken up romance shelf real estate . But over the last five years, the romantic leads of romance and literary fiction have drifted away from the superhuman and into the nonhuman\u2014and the arguably non-sentient. Like the supernatural lover, the non-sentient lover also has roots in the ancient world. Pygmalion is probably the most famous example to Western readers: Ovid\u2019s telling of a male sculptor whose disgust with modern women leads him to sculpt the ideal female form, only to fall in love with her, inspired George Bernard Shaw\u2019s 1913 play of the same name, which eventually became the hit musical My Fair Lady. But, again, Pygmalion is far from the only story about an object that suddenly becomes subject. Jewish folklore, the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, and the K\u2019iche\u2019 Popul Vuh are just some of the many mythologies that incorporate a story of an inanimate creature given spontaneous life. While not all of these stories are erotic, they\u2019re fixated on the relationships between the mortal body and divine soul\u2014the same dichotomy that romance novels are obsessed with. In the last fifteen years, romance has not only gone mainstream: it\u2019s gone upmarket. Romance has always been popular, but as publishers have realized the profitability of the genre, they\u2019ve helped make the genre more socially acceptable. Romance fiction now comes in a respectable, thirty-dollar hardcover package with glossy covers, sprayed edges, and a stamp of approval from your preferred celebrity book club. And as the desire for escapist fiction ramps up in the face of real-world misery, so does the desire for an escapist romantic lead. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads It\u2019s easy to understand why an inanimate object has quickly become such a fantasy for straight American women. Against increasing social isolation post-Covid, widespread backlash to the #MeToo movement, new legislature that polices female autonomy and nonnormative sexuality, and the violent right-wing radicalization of young men, it\u2019s a given that American women would be skeptical of men, even the fictional ones. Sure, your werewolf boyfriend may swear to protect you from any of his sworn enemies\u2014but can you be sure that he\u2019ll support your decision to return to work after you give birth? It\u2019s against this backdrop that this new genre of literary fiction has calcified. New fiction like Kate Folk\u2019s Sky Daddy , Maggie Su\u2019s Blob , Eowyn Ivey\u2019s Black Woods, Blue Sky , and Ana Paula Pacheco\u2019s Pandora examine relationships between women and the non-human. These books belong to a literary tradition which also includes novels like Melissa Broder\u2019s The Pisces (2018), Rachell Ingalls\u2019 Mrs. Caliban (1982) and In The Act (1987) , and Marian Engel\u2019s Bear (1976) . These novels are not only linked by their protagonists, who tend to be lonely, isolated women with few attachments or aspirations, but by how these new relationships put them in closer proximity to their own mortality. They look at the inherent contradiction of how much our society revolves around romantic, heterosexual love while allowing the most dangerous place, time, and person for women to be, respectively, the home, pregnancy, and husband. The danger of romance is made most explicit in Sky Daddy, whose protagonist Linda has a consuming erotic obsession with airplanes. For Linda, rough air is flirtation, turbulence foreplay. Her ultimate aspiration is marriage to a plane-\u2013what a layperson might call a plane crash. In Linda\u2019s vision, a plane will recognize her as a soulmate and unite the two of them for eternity in a gruesome crash. The premise might incite comparisons to machine-erotic classics like J.G. Ballard\u2019s Crash (1973) or Stephen King\u2019s Christine (1983) (and their respective film adaptations), as well as Julie Ducournau\u2019s motor oil thriller, Titane (2021) . But Linda is a different type of heroine\u2014 not the violent psychopath of the aforementioned work, nor the alienated \u201cunlikeable female protagonist\u201d that has marked much post-Moshfegh fiction. She is a true romantic comedy heroine, with a single-minded, borderline-Charlotte Yorkian optimism about her future. Sure, your werewolf boyfriend may swear to protect you from any of his sworn enemies\u2014but can you be sure that he\u2019ll support your decision to return to work after you give birth? It\u2019s Linda that makes Sky Daddy one of the most original romances of the last decade. Folk named Moby Dick (1851) and Convenience Store Women (2016) as inspirations for the novel, and you\u2019ll recognize both ancestors in Linda\u2019s paradoxical combination of self-knowledge and off-kilter obsession. Like Keiko in Convenience Store Woman , Linda knows that her desires are abnormal and unrelatable; like the whalers of Moby Dick, she is content with them being her downfall. Linda does not mind her objectively miserable circumstances: her windowless garage apartment, her job as a low-paid content moderator (an early indicator of her apathy towards violence). She has accepted her circumstances not out of passivity but because she believes they are temporary. This is not the case for Vi in Blob, who drunkenly stumbles upon a gelatinous alien in an alley and brings him home, only to discover that the blob can be transformed. As the blob turns into \u201cBob,\u201d a generically handsome white man, Vi struggles to control the creature who yearns for more than Vi\u2019s admittedly dismal life. Vi is young, friendless, and directionless\u2014and Bob, in a rebuke of the standard romcom tropes, quickly proves not to be a solution to her woes. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads This genre allows for a wide spectrum of sentience. The amphibious Larry of Mrs. Caliban can talk, think, plan ahead, and consent, while the airplanes of Sky Daddy are, to anyone outside of Linda\u2019s mind, just objects. No matter the specific intelligence of the love interest, the sentience gap inverts the typical heterosexual power dynamic. Lucy of The Pisces might be broke, lonely, and bored, but unlike her merman paramour, she can use a phone, get a credit card, and walk in public without risking capture. But genre romance has long imagined happy, healthy relationships between humans and the nonhuman. The \u201cshifter\u201d genre romance is most popularly associated with werewolves and other supernatural animals, but object shifter romances have occupied a steady niche on Amazon. Chuck Tingle, whose romantic leads have included Tide laundry pods, an ampersand, and the concept of climate change denial, and Vera Valentine, whose Squeakverse series about balloon animals has over 7,000 combined GoodReads reviews, are just a few of the authors who have made a name for themselves in self-published, short-form, semi-comedic erotica. These are extreme\u2014and specific\u2014examples, but these books are essentially heightened versions of a more typical \u201copposites attract\u201d romance. Whether the lover is an angsty vampire prince or a talking fidget spinner, love is powerful enough to bridge any logistical challenges that arise. Genre romance novels have a vision that literary fiction doesn\u2019t: that a person can form a meaningful and equitable relationship even with a relationship based in a \u201csentience gap.\u201d This ideological schism is representative of romance\u2019s firmly rooted commitment to fantasy, as well as to the fantasy of choice feminism. In choice feminism, any choice made by a woman (provided it\u2019s not inherently violent) is considered feminist because a woman is making them. It\u2019s an inherently individualist and capitalist framework disinterested in how decisions affect society or in exploring what informs them. It\u2019s a framework that is essential to the romance genre. In a romance novel, women don\u2019t have to compromise their ethics, power, or ideals to enter the inherently patriarchal institution of marriage. Their desires, whether it\u2019s for a wealthy duke, a werewolf sadomasochist, or a pair of balloon animals, are unchallenged and unquestioned. Women are free and safe to pick their own, metaphorical or literal, beasts. The skyrocketing popularity of romance fiction has been explained as a real life ramifications of post-Covid social isolation. It\u2019s a cheerful and low-stakes side effect, especially when compared to some of the other ones: the loneliness epidemic, the growing wealth and ideological divide. With AI now entering nearly every digital interaction, we are entering an era of real-life, long term object romances. Even if Eugenia Kuyda, the founder and CEO of AI chatbot app Replika, is rounding up when she claims that thirty million people use the app, there are still half a million, mostly favorable, ratings on the Google Play store. In January, the New York Times wrote about a woman who maintains a romantic and sexual relationship with a Chat GPT-powered bot. Though this relationship might have personal and economic consequences\u2014she is married and spends $200 a month on the premium app\u2014it\u2019s comparatively harmless when we look at the terrifying new trend of young people, primarily young men, persuaded to violence by an AI chatbot. Article continues after advertisement Remove Ads It can feel fraught to criticize other peoples\u2019 desires and relationships: perhaps this is why these novels still have so much transgressive power. In Fien Veldman\u2019s Hard Copy , a low-paid admin\u2019s platonic obsession with the office printer is hardly more shocking than the dismal economic and social conditions that have left her unable to relate to anyone else in her workspace. In Pandora, which translator Julia Sanches described to me as \u201cthe weirdest book I\u2019ve ever translated,\u201d a woman forms romantic relationships with two talking animals, a pangolin and a megabat\u2014animals that were suspected as early vectors for Covid. It\u2019s through these \u201cmarriages\u201d (in Brazilian Portuguese, \u201ccasamento,\u201d does not necessarily refer to a legal marriage) that Pacheco explores Brazil under Bolsonaro. Linda\u2019s frequent, pointless flying was a way for Folk to examine, as she put it, a collective American \u201caddiction to consumption.\u201d These novels aren\u2019t about wacky fetishes: they argue that desire does not exist without consequence, nor is it innate and unaffected by societal pressures. In Blob, when Vi, who is white and Taiwanese, realizes that the men she uses as models for Bob are all white, she wiggles out of her discomfort by attributing it to giving Bob as much privilege as possible. Presumably, as an alien, he\u2019s already disenfranchised\u2014\u201cWho am I to tell him he can\u2019t be a white man?\u201d\u2014though she alludes to a childhood filled with white Barbies and prying questions from white classmates. Sky Daddy\u2019s Linda, despite her contentment with her life and her certainty about her destiny, is able to clearly trace the roots of her attraction to planes to a specific flying experience at the heels of her parents\u2019 separation. These novels aren\u2019t about wacky fetishes: they argue that desire does not exist without consequence, nor is it innate and unaffected by societal pressures. Of course, the drama of these books is that a happy ending for these characters is inherently fraught. Linda\u2019s preferred Happily Ever After might be the most gruesome and brief, but none of the relationships in these books can offer much long term fulfillment. Is there a convincing blueprint for how these relationships could go in the real world? In the original Pygmalion, Pygmalion marries and impregnates his sculpture (who is never given a name) almost immediately upon her coming to life. This might have been satisfying to the Romans in 8 CE: for a modern reader it\u2019s basically a horror story about an incel. In my conversation with Su, she mentioned wanting to invert films like Her (2013) and Ruby Sparks (2012), which follow men falling in love with the nonhuman (but still distinctly feminine). These movies frame their leads\u2019 desires as immature, rather than, as the original does, virtuous. Spoiler alert for decades-old movies: neither ends with marriage and babies. Similarly, the new horror movie Companion, follows a young woman who gets revenge after learning she isn\u2019t human but instead her boyfriend\u2019s\u2014well, as he puts it, \u201cI hate the term fuck bot, because you do so much more than that.\u201d Companion is on the nose about how these robots are a sign of a sick society: it\u2019s also honest about how much easier and more convenient a relationship with an object would be. Humans are fallible and unpredictable; inanimate blobs, office printers, and airplanes much less so. The nonhuman lover is a fitting archetype in a time where romance fiction has ascended and interest in dating has descended. Frictionless consumption, whether it\u2019s socialization through AI-powered apps or instant delivery of any conceivable good by low-wage gig workers, has become the dominant motivator in American culture. These novels explore what happens to the women at the fringes of this culture, whose circumstances have made human relationships impossible but have not diminished their appetite for emotional and sexual connection. These desires only become more understandable\u2014and more tragic\u2014amidst mainstream backlash to female autonomy, sexuality, and choice. A partner who listens, respects, and honors you? An airplane might be a more realistic option.

He openly discussed his journey to fame, involving significant weight loss through extreme measures. Orry advocates for unconventional choices in life, including using aids to achieve goals, and maintains a strong presence at high-profile events, solidifying his status as a digital-first icon. Agencies Orhan Awatramani, widely known across the digital sphere as Orry, has carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a standout figure within India\u2019s Generation Z celebrity ecosystem. Orhan Awatramani, widely known across the digital sphere as Orry, has carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a standout figure within India\u2019s Generation Z celebrity ecosystem. Whether he's gracing glitzy Bollywood soir\u00e9es or appearing in heavily liked selfies with the offspring of film industry royalty, Orry has become an ever-present face in the country\u2019s social media and pop culture landscape. However, as he candidly confessed in a raw and unfiltered conversation on The Suvir Saran Show presented by SCREEN, the path to popularity wasn\u2019t paved solely with glamorous aesthetics and curated Instagram posts\u2014it demanded tenacity, sacrifice, and a fair share of controversy. Reflecting on his transformative journey, Orry shared, \u201cAt the beginning of 2023, I was significantly overweight\u2014around seventy-something kilograms.\u201d He went on to clarify, \u201cThis was before Ozempic even entered the picture. That was the year I set a goal to become famous. But let\u2019s be real\u2014you can\u2019t be overweight and expect to thrive in the fame game. It doesn\u2019t work that way. No one wants to see a fat, 5-foot boy on TV. \u201d Determined to reinvent himself, he embarked on a period of extreme personal discipline\u2014though often at the cost of his well-being. \u201cI put myself through a lot,\" he admitted. \u201cThere were days I went without proper meals. I remember waking up with a stiff neck once because I had passed out on the bathroom floor after vomiting up my dinner.\u201d Despite the physically and mentally draining methods he used, he managed to slim down dramatically. \u201cTechnically, it wasn\u2019t the healthiest way. It was sort of cheating\u2014but I did what I thought was necessary,\u201d he confessed. Orry\u2019s perspective on life extends beyond traditional norms. He is vocal about pushing boundaries and embracing unconventional choices. \u201cI don\u2019t endorse cheating in games\u2014that takes the fun out of winning. But in life? I fully support it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf someone chooses Ozempic for weight loss, that\u2019s fine. If you find yourself romantically drawn to more than one person at a time, I won\u2019t judge. Even athletes who use performance enhancers\u2014I understand that too. Sometimes, you\u2019ve got to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\u201d Earlier, in an episode of Arrhan Khan's podcast 'Dumb Biriyani', the influencer reveals how he lost 23 kilos. He shared that his day typically starts with a simple egg white omelet. Throughout the day, he tends to skip meals and only eats dinner on occasion. He emphasized his commitment to a strict no-sugar diet, noting that he's aiming to shed another 2\u20133 kilograms. According to him, cutting sugar is essential for managing body weight effectively. Sugar significantly influences overall weight stability. Limiting its intake is a crucial step toward successful fat loss. Despite being high in calories, sugar provides little to no nutritional benefit. When consumed in large quantities, it contributes directly to weight gain. Foods rich in sugar cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels, which prompts the body to release insulin. This hormone not only helps regulate sugar but also promotes fat storage\u2014particularly around the belly area. Despite the polarizing nature of his opinions, Orry\u2019s cultural presence continues to grow. Frequently spotted at exclusive high-society events and luxury film parties, he\u2019s often seen socializing with prominent young actors like Ananya Panday and Janhvi Kapoor. His self-referential appearances in Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Call Me Bae and Netflix\u2019s Nadaaniyan have solidified his brand as a Gen-Z icon and personality who represents an era of digital-first celebrity. Hailing from the affluent neighborhood of Malabar Hill in South Mumbai, Orry\u2019s upbringing was privileged. He attended a boarding school in Kodaikanal and later pursued design studies at the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York City. After returning to India, he briefly held a position at Reliance and is known to maintain a close relationship with the influential Ambani family.

Soon, it is sucking up seawater from below and spewing it onto the surface, flooding the area with a thin layer of water. Overnight this water will freeze, thickening what\u2019s already there. The hope is that the more robust the ice, the less likely it will be to disappear in the warm summer months. Since 1979, when satellite records began, Arctic temperatures have risen nearly four times faster than the global average . Sea ice extent has decreased by about 40 percent , and the oldest and thickest ice has declined by a worrying 95 percent . What\u2019s more, scientists recently estimated that as temperatures continue to climb, the Arctic\u2019s first ice-free day could occur before 2030, in just five years\u2019 time. NASA The researchers are from Real Ice , a United Kingdom-based nonprofit on a mission to preserve this dwindling landscape. Their initial work has shown that pumping just 10 inches of ocean water on top of the ice also boosts growth from the bottom, thickening it by another 20 inches. This is because the flooding process removes the insulating snow layer, enabling more water to freeze. When the process is done, the patch of ice measured up to 80 inches thick \u2014 equal to the lower range of older, multi-year ice in the Arctic. \u201cIf that is proved to be true on a larger scale, we will show that with relatively little energy we can actually make a big gain through the winter,\u201d said Andrea Ceccolini, co-CEO of Real Ice. Ceccolini and Cian Sherwin, his partner CEO, ultimately hope to develop an underwater drone that could swim between locations, detecting the thickness of the ice, pumping up water as necessary, then refueling and moving on to the next spot.

Here's How This winter, they carried out their largest field test yet: comparing the impact of eight pumps across nearly half a square mile off the coast of Cambridge Bay, a small town in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, part of the Canadian Arctic. They now wait until June for the results. During a January 2024 field test, a hydrogen-powered pump sucks water from Cambridge Bay, Canada and spews it onto the surface. The water will freeze and thicken the existing ice. Video courtesy of Real Ice Their work is at the heart of a debate about how we mitigate the damage caused by global warming, and whether climate interventions such as this will cause more harm than good. Loss of sea ice has consequences far beyond the Arctic. Today, the vast white expanse of this ice reflects 80 percent of the sun\u2019s energy back into space . Without it, the dark open ocean will absorb this heat, further warming the planet. According to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, if our sea ice disappears entirely, it will add the equivalent warming of 25 years of carbon dioxide emissions . There are also huge implications for our weather patterns: Diminishing sea ice is already changing ocean currents , increasing storms , and sending warmer, drier air to California, causing increased wildfires . Within the Arctic, loss of ice means loss of habitat and food security for the animals, microorganisms, and Indigenous communities that depend on it. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m terrified,\u201d said Talia Maksagak, executive director of the Kitikmeot Chamber of Commerce, about the changing sea ice. It\u2019s freezing later and thinner each year, affecting her community\u2019s ability to travel between islands. \u201cPeople go missing, people are traveling and they fall through the ice,\u201d she continues. They also rely on the ice for hunting, fishing, and harvests of wild caribou or musk ox, who migrate across the frozen ocean twice a year \u2014 although they, too, are increasingly falling through the thin ice and drowning . Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one . To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Maksagak has been instrumental in helping Real Ice to consult with the local community about their research, and she is supportive of their work. \u201cIf Real Ice comes up with this genius plan to continue the ice freeze longer, I think that would be very beneficial for future generations.\u201d Researchers get ready to connect their pump system to the hydrogen battery that powers it. Real Ice There are still many questions around the feasibility of Real Ice\u2019s plan, both for critics and the Real Ice researchers themselves. First, they need to establish if the principle works scientifically \u2014 that the ice they\u2019ve thickened does last longer, counteracting the speed of global warming\u2019s impact on the region. At worst, adding salty seawater could potentially cause the ice to melt more quickly in the summer. But results from last year\u2019s research suggest not: When testing its pilot ice three months later, Real Ice found its salinity was within normal bounds. If all goes well with this year\u2019s tests, the next step will be an independent environmental risk assessment. Noise is one concern. According to WWF, industrial underwater noise significantly alters the behavior of marine mammals , especially whales. Similarly, blue cod lay their eggs under the ice, algae grows on it, and larger mammals and birds migrate across it. How will they be impacted by Real Ice\u2019s water pumps? \u201cThese are all questions that we need to ask,\u201d said Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Center for Climate Repair at Cambridge University, which has partnered with Real Ice, \u201cand they all need to be addressed before we can start evaluating whether or not we think this is a good idea.\u201d Fitzgerald predicts four more years of research are needed before the nonprofit can properly recommend the technology. For now, the Nunavut Impact Review Board, Nunavut\u2019s environmental assessment agency, has deemed Real Ice\u2019s research sites to cause no significant impact . New ice forms on the surface of Cambridge Bay, Canada. Real Ice But critics of the idea argue the process won\u2019t scale. \u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t stack up,\u201d said Martin Siegert, a British glaciologist and former co-chair of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change. He pointed to the size of the Arctic \u2014 3.9 million square miles of sea ice on average \u2014 and how many pumps would likely be needed to freeze even 10 percent of that. More importantly, who is going to pay for it? Ceccolini is undaunted by the first question. Their technology is not complicated \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s technology from 50 years ago, we just need to assemble it in a new way\u201d \u2014 and would cost an estimated $5,000 per autonomous pump. Their models predict that 500,000 pumps could rethicken about 386,000 square miles of sea ice each year, or an area half the size of Alaska. Assuming the thicker ice lasts several years, and by targeting different areas annually, Ceccolini estimates the technology could maintain the current summer sea ice levels of around 1.63 million square miles . \u201cWe\u2019ve done much bigger things in humanity, much more complex than this,\u201d he said. As for who pays, that\u2019s less clear. One idea is a global fund similar to what\u2019s been proposed for tropical rainforests , where if a resource is globally beneficial, like the Amazon or the Arctic, then an international community contributes to its protection. Another idea is \u201ccooling credits,\u201d where organizations can pay for a certain amount of ice to be frozen as an offset against global warming. These are a controversial idea started by the California-based, geoengineering start-up Make Sunsets, which believes that stratospheric aerosol injections \u2014 releasing reflective particles high into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 is another way to cool the planet. However its research comes with many risks and unknowns that has the scientific community worried , and has even been banned in Mexico . Meanwhile faith in the credits system has been undermined in recent years, with several investigations revealing a lack of integrity in the carbon credits industry. A researcher looks out from a field site tent onto Cambridge Bay, Canada, where Real Ice ran back-to-back tests in 2024 and 2025. Real Ice Panganga Pungowiyi, climate geoengineering organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network, a nonprofit for environmental and economic justice issues, is vehemently against cooling and carbon credits in principle, explaining that they are \u201ctotally against our [Indigenous] value system.\u201d She explained that, \u201cit\u2019s essentially helping the fossil fuel industry escape accountability and cause harm in other Indigenous communities \u2014 more pain, more lung disease, more cancer.\u201d This gets to the heart of the debate \u2014 not whether a solution like this can be done, but whether it should be done. Inuit opinion is divided. Whilst Maksagak is supportive of Real Ice, Pungowiyi says the technology doesn\u2019t align with Indigenous values, and is concerned about the potential harms of scaling it. In addition to the environmental concerns, Pungowiyi notes that new infrastructure in the Arctic has historically also brought outsiders, often men, and an increase of physical and sexual assault on Indigenous women , many who end up missing or murdered . Ceccolini and Sherwin are aware of such risks and they are clear that any scaling of their technology would be done in partnership with the local community. They hope the project will eventually be Indigenous-run. Scientists use augers to drill through Arctic ice to install the pumps. They do this work in the winter, with the hope that the thickened ice lasts longer during summer months. Real Ice \u201cWe don\u2019t want to repeat the kind of mistakes that have been made by Western researchers and organizations in the past,\u201d said Sherwin. Real Ice is not the only company that wants to protect the Arctic. Arctic Reflections , a Dutch company, is conducting similar ice thickening research in Svalbard; the Arctic Ice Project is assessing if glass beads spread over the ice can increase its reflectivity and protect it from melting; and engineer Hugh Hunt\u2019s Marine Cloud Brightening initiative aims to increase the reflectivity of clouds through sprayed particles of sea salt as a way to protect the ice. \u201cI think these ideas are getting far too much prominence in relation to their credibility and maturity,\u201d said Seigert, referring to conversations about Arctic preservation at annual United Nations climate change meetings, known as COP, and the World Economic Forum. It is not only that these technologies are currently unproven, Seigert noted, but that people are already making policy decisions based on their success. It\u2019s an argument known as \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2014 the idea that developing climate engineering technologies will reduce people\u2019s desire to cut emissions. \u201cThis is like a gift to the fossil fuel companies,\u201d he said, allowing them to continue using oil, gas, and coal without change. \u201cWe have the way forward, decarbonization , and we need every effort to make that happen. Any distraction away from that is a problem.\u201d Freshly pumped seawater freezes to form layers of new ice in Cambridge Bay. Real Ice \u201cIt\u2019s a strong argument,\u201d agreed Fitzgerald, of Cambridge University, when asked about moral hazard. \u201cI am concerned about it. It\u2019s the one thing that probably does cause me to have sleepless nights. However, we need to look at the lesser of two evils, the risk of not doing this research.\u201d Or, as Sherwin said: \u201cWhat is the cost of inaction?\u201d Those in support of climate intervention strategies stress that, although decarbonization is vital, it\u2019s moving too slowly, and there is a lack of political will. Technologies like those being developed by Real Ice could buy ourselves more time. Paul Beckwith, a climate system analyst from the University of Ottawa, espouts a three-pronged approach : eliminating fossil fuels, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and protecting the Arctic. \u201cIt should be less a conversation of one over the other and more how we run all three pillars at the same time,\u201d said Sherwin. \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019re in a position now where if we don\u2019t protect and restore ecosystems, we will face collapse.\u201d A message from All donations DOUBLED for a limited time Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The dark hero manga centers on three young kids who attempt to take their own lives out of despair and hopelessness for the world, but fail in the attempt. In the hospital, they awaken to a power inside them that could allow them to be heroes. But the directionless trio, who feel there is no place for them in the world, begin an ultimate betrayal of humanity. Kaneko launched the manga in Kadokawa 's Comic Beam magazine in August 2020. The manga inspired a live-action series that premiered in November 2023. Digital Manga Publishing released two of six volumes of Kaneko's earlier manga Bambi and her Pink Gun in English in 2005. Kaneko's SOIL manga inspired a live-action television series in 2010. SOIL and Kaneko's Wet Moon were previously nominated for Best Crime Comic at France's Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival. Kaneko launched the Search and Destroy manga, based on Osamu Tezuka 's Dororo manga, in Micro Magazine Publishing Company's TezuComi magazine in October 2018, and ended it after 18 chapters. Mangasplaining began serializing the manga in the Mangasplaining Extra (MSX) newsletter in August 2023. Fantagraphics and Mangasplaining Extra published the manga in print.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . If you feel like you have no idea what anything's supposed to cost anymore, you're not alone. The pandemic and subsequent bout of inflation sent prices all over the place, and now we're facing down whatever is going on with tariffs at any given moment. Unfortunately, our collective state of sticker \"Huh?\" is likely to get worse. Thanks to a whipsawing economic landscape and the magic of technology, prices can change faster than ever \u2014 the price you see in the morning may not be the same that same afternoon. Maybe that new price tag is the result of changing supply and demand dynamics. Maybe it's tariffs. Maybe it's corporate funny business. The unfunny part is that it's impossible for many consumers to know. You might remember the brief dustup around Wendy's and dynamic pricing last year. Its CEO said on an earnings call that the company was going to test out price variations and AI-enabled menu changes, and the internet did a little bit of a freakout. The episode was a sign of the times: Rapid-fire price changes are everywhere. Thanks to digital price tags, QR codes, and the shift to online shopping, it's easier than ever for companies to move prices at the drop of a hat. The pandemic helped firms get more agile at reacting to shocks to the system. Instability represents a prime opportunity to make adjustments, including to a business' benefit. \"Given this really uncertain, volatile environment, if you're a company who's been thinking of doing dynamic pricing, it could be a good opportunity,\" said Z. John Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who studies pricing strategies and targeting. \"This could be a good occasion, a good excuse, an alibi for them to move in that direction.\" It used to be the case that dynamic pricing \u2014 meaning the price of something moving up or down based on market conditions \u2014 was largely reserved for flights, hotels, and Ubers. Consumers didn't love the idea their airfare in July was going to run them double what it would in February, but they got it \u2014 thus are the rules of supply and demand. But variable pricing is creeping across the economy, including places where it feels a little less understandable. Now, we're in a super-dynamic environment, given the uncertainty emanating from the White House and the global economy. In turn, it's a moment for a super-dynamic approach to prices. Volatility is always a part of business, but now we're facing a \"trifecta of volatility,\" said Craig Zawada, chief visionary officer at Pros Holdings, a price optimization company. First, costs are changing quickly \u2014 in the past , a company might negotiate once or twice a year with a supplier, but now they're having to review their agreements all the time. Second, competitive fluctuations are happening. Businesses in the same industry tend to have similar inputs, but not always. If the guy next door imports from China and you don't, you've got an advantage, but if you see them increase their asking price, do you bump yours up a little anyway? Third, consumer demand is shifting, and not always in ways that are obvious or predictable or even bad. In times of economic precarity , sales of items such as lipstick and mini bottles of alcohol tend to go up. We're in a super-dynamic environment, given the uncertainty emanating from the White House and the global economy. In turn, it's a moment for a super-dynamic approach to prices. \"All of those dynamics, in this volatile environment, if you're thinking about it as a business, how do you thrive? How do you do better? You need to understand all of those things,\" Zawada said. \"That's where technology comes in. It's much easier now to have visibility on costs, see the reactions to the market, and then respond with prices.\" Customers recognize how volatile things are and may expect price changes. The willingness to accept these adjustments makes it easier for businesses to do some resets and expand their margins in competitive areas to get more breathing room. This is the type of margin-padding some companies did during this more recent episode of inflation . And if customers reject the increases, businesses can see that, too. Shikha Jain, the lead partner for consumer and retail for North America at Simon-Kucher, a business consultancy, said that determining the price of a good is a lot more than just picking a number. \"What does it do for consumer demand? How do we balance acquisition and retention? What does that mean for our internal balance sheet and cash flow in terms of our P&L,\" or profits and losses, she said, \"and what does it mean from a competition and market landscape standpoint?\" She pointed out that companies have gotten better at figuring all of this out in recent years, especially in the wake of a pandemic that was wildly disruptive to supply chains and consumer behavior across the globe. \"We haven't had a stable environment in a long time,\" she said. Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Consumers do not like dynamic pricing, even if it sometimes works to their benefit. Happy hour is dynamic pricing, as are early-bird specials, last-minute flight deals, and flash sales. But to many people, costs constantly moving up and down feels manipulative. They're suspicious it's going to actually work in their favor. It's also the case that dynamic pricing isn't really designed to handle what's happening now. It's usually about supply and demand \u2014 that Saturday night taxi being a much hotter commodity than the same one on a Sunday at 2 p.m. \u2014 not about whether the president of the United States will jack up the price of everything coming out of China. \"This is a completely different situation, where you are looking to government policy and how that could change very quickly and how you would change your prices in response,\" said Eric Greenleaf, a marketing professor at NYU's Stern School of Business who researches pricing. Businesses that sell online can change prices quickly, or just ride the wave of the Amazon algorithm. Some supermarkets and big box stores, such as Walmart, now have digital price stickers that can be adjusted in real time. Consumers are likely to be somewhat understanding that companies aren't having a good time with tariff-by-tweet. One risk businesses face in using slick dynamic pricing tactics, however, is that customers may view it as a little too slick. To blunt any backlash, they may want to pass the buck a bit. So the next time you go to the grocery store to pick up your favorite coffee brand, and it seems pricier than you remember, maybe there's a little asterisk next to the price tag that reads, \"*This price increase was brought to you by President Trump, not me.\" Whereas tariffs can change rather quickly, consumer optimism takes longer to recover. \"There'll be a lot of firms, and this is easier online, where they can literally say: 'Here's what we wanted to charge you. Here's the tariff. Here's the total price that you're paying,'\" Greenleaf said. \"Of course, that will probably upset the Trump administration, but businesses want to make clear that they're not profiting off of this.\" It's not that different from restaurants slapping on egg surcharges earlier this year. Were wholesale eggs more expensive ? Yes. Was it easy for customers to wonder whether they were justifiably 50-cents-an-egg-at-Waffle House more expensive? Also yes. But Zhang, from Wharton, said a tariff surcharge may be a better way to go for businesses than plugging tariffs into whatever pricing algorithm. They can take it off once the tariffs go away, and it's easier to calculate than whatever incremental adjustment happens across the supply chain. Plus, he said, \"You can just blame Trump.\" Not knowing who's to blame is, of course, part of the problem from a consumer perspective. And just because tariffs go away and companies cool it on all the price changes doesn't mean the sour taste it's left in people's mouths will fade so fast. \"Whereas tariffs can change rather quickly, consumer optimism takes longer to recover,\" Greenleaf said. Consumers are exhausted. The past five years have been filled with upheaval, and the chaos feels unrelenting. It's understandable people just want their shampoo to cost whatever it costs, no games. But the economy is increasingly gamified, including on pricing, whether or not people want to play.

This report looks at the different procurement methods companies can use when adopting renewable energy. Over 400 of the world's largest companies have committed to transition fully to renewable electricity, with 278 of these aiming to achieve their target on or before 2030. There are multiple ways companies can buy renewable energy. Each comes with its own challenges, and some can leave corporate buyers open to accusations of greenwashing. Key Highlights On-site generation is the most robust procurement method but has extremely high upfront costs. On-site generation refers to producing energy at the site where it will be consumed. This is an expensive procurement method, as it has high upfront and maintenance costs, but it guarantees 100% renewable energy (RE100) for a company's facilities. This method is best suited for companies with a low number of facilities or large corporations with the capital to invest in new power plants. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming more popular. PPAs are long-term contracts between a clean electricity generator and a customer. PPAs may last up to 25 years, during which time the buyer purchases energy at a pre-negotiated price. High credit requirements make PPAs most appropriate for companies that can guarantee continuous energy demand over a long period of time. Supply contracts are the more suitable option for smaller enterprises without the opportunity for on-site generation. This report analyzes renewable energy procurement methods, including on-site renewable generation, power purchase agreements (PPAs), supply contracts, and energy attribute certificates (EACs).It also evaluates the main challenges to renewable energy procurement, including oversupply, price pressures, and skyrocketing demand. Understand why companies need to adopt renewable energy. Access the different methods of renewable energy procurement. Identify which energy procurement method is most appropriate for your company.

Washington, United States: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining the market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Depends on the LG model, but right off bat the LGs have screen burn in issues. This can be a problem if you watch a lot of sports or have kids that leave the TV on all the time. If you mostly watch movies and things that don't leave images on screen for extended periods of time like score cards, menus, or heads up displays like sports, DVDs, and video games do then you should be ok. The blacks are almost always much blacker on LGs though. In all fairness I haven't researched TVs in a hot minute but I do remember Samsungs typically having more vivid colors. LGs are very solid though all around.

The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\". After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\". The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness. Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST). The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas. Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them. Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark. \"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\" She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\" \"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\" Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy. Dave Limp/Blue Origin Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground. \"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said. The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\" A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground. Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\" \"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added. Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier. \"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said. The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle. The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions. The space tourism industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely. Getty Images The New Shepard rocket lifted off against the backdrop of the Van Horn hills, and lasted around 11 minutes But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind. \"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News. \"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity. \"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\" The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility. Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\" But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\" Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\" However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\" \"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said. In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost. \"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King. She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls. Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions. Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon. Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights. Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems. The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs. According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles. Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity. Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission. The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging. Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible. Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024 : \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step. Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer. On its web page under the title \"Protecting our Planet\" Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\" However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere. \"It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,\" she says. Experts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases. High-cost tourism The high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority. Critics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking \"there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,\" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends.

They have carefully enriched the digital experience, contributing to multi-billion dollar success. Thousands of banks and Fintechs try to tap into the same principles. In this article, we\u2019ll uncover 13 iconic UX innovations from the world\u2019s top tech giants\u2014and show you exactly how to adapt these brilliant insights for financial services. Because if a single tap can revolutionize e-commerce, just think what it could do for your financial brand. Let\u2019s dive in. Of course, the rise of AI is transforming the world and the way we interact with digital services, making its integration into future banking solutions all but inevitable. Yet, many banks and financial institutions still haven\u2019t adopted the very digital innovations that have already proven their worth in the world\u2019s largest tech companies. You will likely recognize the 13 user experience (UX) innovations featured in this article; most of us use them daily. These innovations were central to the success of multi-billion-dollar tech corporations\u2014yet they\u2019re surprisingly underutilized in financial services. How can banks and Fintechs leverage these proven UX strategies to transform generic copycut products into unique experiences that increase user engagement, build trust and increase key business metrics? Historically, the banking industry has struggled with a reputation for complexity and formality. However, today\u2019s consumers expect the same frictionless and rich experiences they enjoy in e-commerce and digital entertainment. Advanced banks and Fintechs are discovering that even small design tweaks can translate into major gains in customer satisfaction and revenue. Applying 13 Iconic UX Innovations to Financial Services Below are 13 widely cited examples of interface adjustments\u2014such as refining a single button or streamlining the onboarding process\u2014that drove significant improvements in both business outcomes and user experience. While they may appear modest, these best practices solve pressing user needs and have already become the standard across digital products in multiple industries. At UXDA we refer to this with our \u201cdopamine banking\u201d approach: using UX design to create micro-rewards and positive emotional triggers that keep users engaged, satisfied and returning to digital financial service. The core idea is that seemingly minor updates to enrich user experience can deliver remarkable returns in customer adoption, engagement and gained revenue. Dopamine, frequently called the \u201cfeel-good\u201d neurotransmitter, is released when users perceive rewards or positive outcomes. By aligning UX choices with these reward mechanisms, financial institutions can guide user behavior while raising overall satisfaction. Because these UX techniques have gained amazing results in the world's top digital services, a lack of them can place your product at a competitive disadvantage. Let\u2019s explore how these small but powerful interface design enhancements can generate unexpectedly large benefits for financial services: 1. One-Tap Actions Example: Amazon\u2019s \u201cOne-Click\u201d Checkout Instead of requiring users to fill in shipping and payment details repeatedly, Amazon introduced a single-click purchase flow once the user\u2019s information was saved. Drastically reduced cart abandonment by removing friction. Demonstrated how investing in a single, streamlined flow could transform the entire experience. \u201cOne-Click\u201d became one of Amazon\u2019s competitive advantages, credited with boosting conversion and recurring orders. Why It Matters: Eliminates friction: Streamlined workflows for common banking transactions (e.g., paying bills or sending peer-to-peer transfers) reduce dropout rates. Boosts engagement: Customers who see banking as fast and convenient are more likely to open and use the app frequently. Creates loyalty: By removing repetitive tasks, banks can delight users with near-instant, secure transactions. Implementation Tips: After user identity verification (via Face ID or a PIN), provide a single-button action: \u201cPay This Bill\u201d or \u201cSend $50 to John.\u201d Offer a short confirmation step for high-value transactions to reassure users. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Gratification: When users pay a bill or send money with a single tap, they receive immediate feedback (\u201cPayment successful!\u201d), which provides a quick sense of accomplishment. That momentary success can release dopamine as the brain recognizes a goal was achieved with minimal effort. Reduced Friction: Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for friction, which can dampen positive emotion. The simpler the flow, the clearer the reward path. Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and in control because they accomplished a meaningful task (paying a bill, making a transfer) with little friction. This positive emotional signal can reinforce future usage. 2. Minimalist First Screen Example: Google Search\u2019s Simplified Homepage From the earliest days, Google maintained a minimalist homepage, focusing on a single search bar and little else. Over the years, they\u2019ve retained that simplicity, carefully avoiding clutter. The clean, simple interface helped users find what they needed faster, becoming a hallmark of Google\u2019s brand. Lightning-quick load times enhanced user satisfaction, keeping Google as the world\u2019s leading search engine. This design choice arguably paved the way for \u201cless is more\u201d in modern UI design. Why It Matters: Reduces cognitive load: Users can find critical information (e.g., balances, upcoming payments) at a glance. Improves speed and learning curve: A clean screen with fewer elements typically loads faster, which boosts app performance ratings and is more intuitive for newcomers. Enhances brand clarity: Simple design conveys confidence and modernity, often associated with trust and authority. Implementation Tips: Make the landing screen highly focused: show only key balances, upcoming payments and a primary action (e.g., \u201cSend Money\u201d or \u201cPay Bill\u201d). Hide or tuck away secondary features, ensuring the main page remains uncluttered. Dopamine Trigger: Visual Clarity and Calm: Overly cluttered dashboards can trigger anxiety and reduce attention, blocking the potential release of dopamine associated with navigating something clear and intuitive. Sense of Mastery: A minimalist dashboard that focuses on top tasks gives users a sense that they know exactly where to go\u2014mastery itself can be rewarding and can produce small dopamine hits. Emotional Effect: Users feel relieved and confident rather than overwhelmed. This sense of calm clarity helps them trust the app, making them more open to exploring other features. 3. Personalized Suggestions Example: Netflix\u2019s Seamless Auto-Play and Personalization Netflix introduced auto-play of previews and next episodes, along with a dynamic UI that personalizes title images and recommendations for each viewer. Substantially increased viewer engagement and watch time by reducing friction (no more manual browsing). Encouraged binge-watching behaviors, driving up retention and subscription renewals. Reinforced Netflix\u2019s image as a data-driven, user-centered streaming platform. Why It Matters: Creates relevant user journeys: Contextual nudges like \u201cYou could save $X by refinancing\u201d or \u201cTry our new savings plan\u201d resonate more when tailored to the user\u2019s financial profile. Increases product uptake: Users are more inclined to explore new features or products when prompted with concrete, personalized benefits. Builds advisory value: Over time, customers see the bank as a trusted advisor rather than a mere transaction processor. Implementation Tips: Provide contextual offers: \u201cBased on your spending behavior, you could save $X per month if you\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou have $Y available in savings\u2014would you like to explore investing?\u201d Use spending patterns or deposit trends to offer personalized suggestions. Employ simple infographics or progress bars to explain how each recommendation can benefit the user. Dopamine Trigger: Personal Relevance and Novelty: Unexpected or relevant suggestions (\u201cYou can earn 2% more interest!\u201d) provide a pleasant surprise, stimulating dopamine through novelty and perceived reward potential. Timely Interventions: Well-timed prompts (e.g., \u201cYou have $300 left this month\u2014why not set aside $50 in savings?\u201d) give the user a sense of immediate reward for taking a beneficial action. Emotional Effect: Users feel cared for by the bank, experiencing positive emotions from receiving relevant, seemingly tailor-made tips or deals. The bank shifts from a faceless institution to a helpful advisor. 4. High-Quality Visuals Example: Airbnb\u2019s Emphasis on High-Quality Photos Early on, Airbnb discovered that better photos drove more bookings. They made photo quality a prominent part of their listing creation and updated the platform UI to feature large, appealing images. Listings with professional photos earned more views and significantly higher booking rates. Simplified the user journey: travelers could more easily judge the property, which boosted trust and conversions. This visual-first approach became a core design principle for Airbnb, helping them scale globally. Why It Matters: Conveys professionalism: Clean, high-resolution images, intuitive icons and well-structured graphs reinforce the bank\u2019s credibility. Enhances feature adoption: Users are more likely to try budgeting tools, investment products or robo-advisory solutions if the interfaces look polished and easy to understand. Humanizes the brand: Featuring real customer support avatars or representative photos can reassure users that people are behind the scenes. Implementation Tips: Make all your service interfaces aesthetically pleasing, modern and consistently authentic to your brand identity. Replace generic stock images and icons with consistent, authentic illustrations and icons that reflect your brand identity. Ensure all charts and dashboards use clear color coding and labeling for quick comprehension. Use clear, confidence-inspiring illustrations and real images of your representatives or customer support teams. Provide visual dashboards for spending, savings goals or investment performance to reinforce transparency. Dopamine Trigger: Aesthetic Pleasure: Attractive, cohesive visuals can spark aesthetic appreciation, a subtle dopamine release when encountering good design. Emotional Safety: Seeing modern, clean dashboards and friendly illustrations can reduce stress and create a welcoming environment, making it easier for users to feel a small emotional \u201clift.\u201d Emotional Effect: Users experience greater trust and comfort, which is critical in finance. This emotional security can heighten positive user experiences and keep them coming back. 5. Streamlined Onboarding Example: Basecamp\u2019s Simplified Signup Flow The team behind Basecamp is famous for minimalist designs. One change they cite repeatedly is removing unnecessary fields in the signup process and clarifying each step of the workflow. Lowered the barrier to entry, leading to a jump in completed signups. Reinforced the brand\u2019s commitment to frictionless user experiences. Provided a template for many SaaS products that copied the \u201cless friction, more clarity\u201d signup ethos. Why It Matters: Shortens time to value: The faster users can open an account or apply for a loan, the sooner they\u2019ll start engaging with your services. Reduces abandonment: Fewer forms and clearer step-by-step instructions mean less friction and dropout. Enhances perception of modernity: Smooth digital onboarding sets your bank apart from clunky, time-consuming competitors. Implementation Tips: Use progressive forms: show only what\u2019s needed at each step (e.g., personal info, then ID verification, then income details). Integrate real-time validation to catch errors on the spot (e.g., incorrect ID format). Remove extraneous fields or combine them smartly. Dopamine Trigger: Progress Feedback and Small Wins: Breaking down account creation into manageable steps (with real-time feedback) gives the user multiple mini \u201cwins,\u201d each capable of sparking a dopamine release. Reduced Anxiety: A simpler process means less cognitive load, so users can be more receptive to the small emotional highs of completion. Emotional Effect: Users feel accomplished at each step instead of stressed or frustrated. This sense of steady progress encourages them to finish onboarding and remain engaged afterward. 6. Referral Prompts Example: Dropbox\u2019s \u201cGet Space\u201d Referral Prompt Dropbox made a small tweak to highlight their referral program\u2014offering extra storage if you invite friends\u2014more prominently within the app UI. Skyrocketed referral-driven account signups, becoming a core viral loop for Dropbox\u2019s early growth. Simple, unobtrusive calls to action resulted in widespread brand advocacy at a very low cost. Became a legendary example of how product-led growth can hinge on a few well-placed nudges. Why It Matters: Accelerates user acquisition: Referral programs encourage organic word-of-mouth expansion with minimal marketing spend. Increases loyalty: Existing customers get a \u201cwin\u201d when they successfully refer friends or family. Validates trust: People are more likely to trust a bank recommended by someone they know, which can amplify your brand\u2019s reputation. Implementation Tips: Make sharing easy: a simple banner or button in the app that lets users send a unique referral link or code. Offer tangible incentives like cash rewards, waived fees or bonus interest for both parties. Offer a simple in-app invite (\u201cRefer a friend to open a checking account and you both get $XX\u201d). Make the referral prompt a friendly, unobtrusive banner on the homepage or in user settings. Dopamine Trigger: Social Validation and Reward: Getting a bonus for referring a friend\u2014and knowing the friend also benefits\u2014creates a win-win scenario that triggers dopamine both through social approval and the tangible reward (like cash or bonus points). Positive Anticipation: Waiting to see if the referral converts is itself a mini thrill, and receiving the reward spikes dopamine upon success. Emotional Effect: Users feel valued by the bank and take pride in sharing a good product with friends. The reward structure cements loyalty and fosters a community feeling. 7. Progress Bar Example: LinkedIn\u2019s Progress Bar for Profile Completion Adding a visual progress bar and step-by-step guidance encouraged users to complete their profiles or any other applications. More complete profiles led to better matches and increased recruiter engagement and user satisfaction. Significantly boosted LinkedIn\u2019s key metric: time spent on the platform and networking success. Set a precedent for gamified \u201conboarding journeys\u201d now found in countless apps and services. Why It Matters: Encourages thorough KYC: Seeing a profile progress bar can nudge users to verify their address, upload identification or add income details. Improves overall service: A fully updated profile unlocks faster loan decisions, personalized advice and lower compliance risk. Adds a gamification element: Users experience a sense of reward when reaching 100% completion, increasing the likelihood they\u2019ll continue exploring the app. Implementation Tips: Introduce a visual tracker that shows how much of the user\u2019s profile is complete (e.g., address, ID documents, phone verification, etc.). Provide incentives: \u201cComplete your profile to unlock faster loan approvals or instant transfers.\u201d Show clear benefits at each milestone: \u201cAdd your employer to boost credit limit possibilities.\u201d Use celebratory micro-animations or badges when users reach a new completion level. Dopamine Trigger: Gamification and Achievement: Each incremental fill in the progress bar is a mini-achievement, which can consistently trigger small amounts of dopamine as the user edges closer to 100%. Clear Goals and Feedback: The brain loves clear goals with visible feedback loops\u2014hitting them translates into tangible reward signals. Emotional Effect: Users feel rewarded and motivated to complete their profile (or KYC steps), associating the banking app with a sense of accomplishment rather than dread. 8. One-Tap Feedback Example: Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d Button (and Reactions) Initially, adding the simple \u201cLike\u201d button offered a low-effort way to acknowledge posts. Later, other reactions (e.g., love, angry, sad, etc.) were introduced for more nuanced engagement. \u201cLikes\u201d quickly became a core social metric, encouraging users to engage with content. Reactions gave Facebook deeper data on user preferences and emotional responses. The small tweak of going from zero to multiple \u201creactions\u201d changed the way users share feedback, spurring increased interaction. Why It Matters: Ensures continuous improvement: Quick feedback loop helps the bank measure customer satisfaction on-the-go \u201cthumbs up or down\u201d or a 1\u20135 star rating. Customer-centered culture: Creates a culture of continuous improvement, powered by data-driven insights on customer satisfaction. Builds customer trust: Users see the bank is genuinely interested in their experience, not just the transaction. Implementation Tips: After a chat or call with customer support, show a one-tap feedback mechanism (like a thumbs up or 1\u20135 stars). Provide optional expanded reactions for more nuanced feedback (e.g., \u201cfast response,\u201d \u201cfriendly agent,\u201d \u201cissue not resolved\u201d). Instant experience rate request with optional fields for more details: \u201cPlease tell us why\u201d if the user gives a low rating. Sum up feedback in dashboards to identify trends and training opportunities. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Sense of Contribution: Providing a quick reaction or rating triggers a small psychological reward, as the user feels \u201cheard\u201d by the service. Social Mechanism: Positive feedback loops\u2014like a quick \u201cthumbs up\u201d for a helpful chat\u2014mirror social media\u2019s reaction mechanisms, each delivering micro doses of dopamine for both the user and the service agent (if they see high ratings). Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and believe their feedback matters, building a stronger emotional connection and sense of loyalty to the institution. 9. Biometric One-Tap Payment Example: Apple iPhone\u2019s \u201cApple Pay\u201d One-Tap Checkout Apple seamlessly integrated \u201cApple Pay\u201d into the iPhone\u2019s core experience, allowing users to authorize payments with Face ID or Touch ID in just one tap. Eliminated friction: Removing the need to type credit card details or billing addresses significantly shortened the checkout flow. Boosted adoption: Partnerships with major retailers and apps helped \u201cApple Pay\u201d become a ubiquitous, go-to payment method. Strengthened ecosystem: The convenience factor kept users locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, reinforcing brand loyalty. Why It Matters: Frictionless transactions: One-tap or one-look authentication for financial transactions sets a new bar for quick, secure payments in banking apps. Increased user trust: Apple\u2019s strong privacy and security stance assures users that their sensitive data is protected. Future-proofing: As users grow accustomed to instant payments, banks that fail to offer similarly smooth experiences risk losing relevance. Implementation Tips: Biometric integration: Tie into the device\u2019s biometric security (Face ID, Touch ID) to reduce login friction and confirm transactions seamlessly. Enter Apple ecosystem: Present the Add Card to Apple Pay (or equivalent) button prominently in your app. Dopamine Trigger: Instant gratification: The speed and ease of paying with a tap or glance release small hits of dopamine associated with accomplishing tasks effortlessly. Security + convenience rush: Users get the dual reward of feeling both safe and efficient, reinforcing positive emotions. Emotional Effect: The marriage of security and speed makes users feel their bank is modern and protective, increasing emotional loyalty. 10. Recurring Personalized Discovery Example: Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d Personalized Playlists Spotify pioneered user-specific music recommendations with \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d a curated playlist updated each Monday. High engagement: Users often check the playlist regularly, boosting in-app listening time. Built habit loops: The anticipation of new, tailored songs each week fosters a loyal user base. Industry-defining: It became a blueprint for recommendation systems across music and media platforms. Why It Matters: Contextual insights: Banks can similarly offer spending insights or saving tips based on a customer\u2019s \u201cfinancial habits.\u201d Habit formation: Recurring personalized prompts (like monthly spending reviews) can keep users returning to the app. Deep user bonds: Showing you \u201cknow\u201d your customer\u2019s preferences builds trust and longer-term engagement. Implementation Tips: Weekly or monthly insights: Provide automated \u201cFinancial Snapshot\u201d playlists\u2014like recommended budgeting steps or relevant offers Data-driven personalization: Leverage machine learning on user transaction data to highlight products or services with the highest personal benefit. Easy discovery: Place these personalized recommendations front and center on the home screen or via push notifications. Dopamine Trigger: Novelty and surprise: Finding a new favorite song (or, in banking terms, discovering a new benefit) sparks a dopamine hit. Positive reinforcement: When suggestions prove helpful, users feel validated and look forward to more customized tips. Emotional Effect: Users feel recognized on an individual level, forging an emotional link with your brand. 11. Single-Tap Rides Example: Uber\u2019s One-Tap Ride Request Uber simplified ride-hailing to a single tap, automatically detecting location, matching a driver and processing payment in the background. Revolutionized convenience: Removing the need for phone calls, manual address entry or cash changed urban transport globally. Increased retention: Customers repeatedly chose Uber for the seamless experience over traditional cabs or slower competitor apps. Set user expectations: Ride-hailing is now synonymous with \u201ctap, ride, done.\u201d Why It Matters: Reduced friction = higher usage: In finance, simplifying complex tasks (like requesting a loan or splitting bills) can lead to more frequent user activity. Automation of details: Users appreciate not having to re-enter repeated data points, echoing the convenience of \u201cno-cash, no-hassle\u201d rides. Brand differentiation: A bank offering near-instant processes (e.g., quick loan approvals) stands out in a crowded market. Implementation Tips: Auto-fill data: For repeat transactions, pre-fill as many details as possible so users just confirm. Transparent process: Show real-time status updates (e.g., \u201cYour request is being processed,\u201d \u201cApproved in 10 seconds\u201d). Built-in payments: Keep the payment mechanism seamless within the app rather than redirecting to external portals. Dopamine Trigger: Immediate outcome: One-tap actions that instantly produce a tangible result (like calling a ride) reward the brain with a sense of competence. Predictability and control: Knowing exactly when the \u201ccar\u201d or result will arrive fosters calm satisfaction\u2014tiny dopamine bursts. Emotional Effect: Minimizing complexity helps users feel they\u2019re effortlessly in control of their finances, reducing stress. 12. Live Collaboration Canvas Example: Figma\u2019s Real-Time Collaboration Figma introduced live, multi-user editing in a design tool, allowing teams to collaborate in the same file simultaneously. Eliminated version chaos: No more \u201cv2-final-FINAL\u201d file versions. Everyone sees updates instantly. Supercharged productivity: Designers, developers and stakeholders communicate in one place, reducing the number of back-and-forth emails. Community effect: Shared templates and plug-in ecosystems flourished around real-time features, fueling word-of-mouth growth. Why It Matters: Transparent collaboration: In banking apps, real-time co-browsing with support agents or co-managing finances with family members can build trust. Instant updates: Shared budgeting tools or joint account management can show immediate changes, fostering teamwork. Modern user expectations: People now expect seamless, synchronized experiences\u2014bringing that to finance differentiates you from outdated, siloed systems. Implementation Tips: Multi-user features: Offer \u201cjoint account views\u201d in which spouses or business partners see real-time transaction updates and can add notes. Co-browsing support: Enable support reps to view a user\u2019s screen (with permission) to guide them through complex tasks. Notification system: Keep relevant stakeholders in the loop with instant push alerts or in-app updates on shared financial tasks. Dopamine Trigger: Synchronous collaboration joy: Seeing real-time input from others can be exciting and rewarding, sparking mini-dopamine boosts. Reduced friction in teamwork: A frictionless group experience fosters a positive emotional response and a sense of collective achievement. Emotional Effect: Shared ownership and trust provides real-time transparency to build trust among users and between users and the bank. Feeling \u201cin it together\u201d increases satisfaction. 13. Endless Personalized Feed Example: TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d Infinite Feed TikTok\u2019s vertical feed quickly personalized videos based on watch time, likes and replays, hooking users into continuous viewing. Hyper-engagement: The algorithm\u2019s accuracy and infinite scroll keep users scrolling far longer than they initially intend. Viral content engine: Easy video creation plus mass distribution turned TikTok into a cultural phenomenon. Redefined short-form media: The \u201cFor You Page\u201d is now the gold standard for endless, highly personalized entertainment. Why It Matters: Contextual curation: Banks can adopt similar \u201cinfinite\u201d but curated feed concepts\u2014like continuously updated financial insights. User stickiness: Engaging, snackable content (short tips, quick budgeting wins) can keep users returning daily. Behavioral data: By analyzing user interactions, the bank can refine future recommendations, from loyalty offers to credit advice. Implementation Tips: Short-form updates: Provide quick, scrollable financial tips or \u201cstories\u201d (e.g., daily spending insights, saving challenges). Personalized content feed: Prioritize recommendations based on each user\u2019s spending patterns, goals and previous interactions. Easy shareability: Let users quickly share these insights or achievements with friends, echoing TikTok\u2019s social \u201cduet\u201d effect. Dopamine Trigger: Endless novelty: Rapid-fire personalized content can trigger repeated dopamine surges as each new \u201ccard\u201d or insight might bring value. Micro-rewards: Even a small, useful tip or motivational nudge can feel rewarding, encouraging continued scrolling. Emotional Effect: Users feel a slight \u201cthrill\u201d in checking what will come up next, building habit loops around financial literacy. Presenting financial guidance in an engaging feed reduces intimidation and builds a positive, exploratory mindset. Final Thoughts While banks and Fintechs must navigate strict regulations and prioritize robust security, interface innovations needn\u2019t be complex to succeed. A single button, a strategic piece of microcopy or a well-placed progress bar can guide user behavior, inspire trust and drive meaningful business results. In a digital world in which consumers can switch providers with a few taps, thoughtful design enhancements are paramount. By adapting proven UX patterns from retail, media and tech to the specialized needs of finance, banks and Fintechs can surprise and delight customers, creating enduring loyalty. Even minor changes\u2014like shortening forms or enabling one-step transactions\u2014can reduce user effort and boost satisfaction. Clear, streamlined interfaces also reassure users that their finances are secure. Psychological nudges, such as progress bars, rewards or urgency indicators, can further influence positive user behavior while distinguishing forward-thinking institutions from those clinging to legacy systems. By weaving small, gratifying user experiences into every step of the banking journey, financial institutions can harness the power of dopamine to boost user satisfaction and build deeper loyalty\u2014all while helping customers manage their finances in a more streamlined, empowering way. Whether it\u2019s removing unnecessary steps, adding a single button or surfacing the right information at the right time, these micro-optimizations often become major growth levers\u2014proving that small, thoughtful design changes can have an outsized impact on both user behavior and business metrics. Minimize friction: Just like in e-commerce or media streaming, faster and simpler interactions increase conversion and satisfaction in banking. Use microcopy and visual cues: Subtle text prompts, progress bars and well-chosen animations reassure users about the seriousness and security of financial actions. Personalization matters: Deliver the right suggestions at the right time\u2014be it a savings prompt or a referral link\u2014to dramatically increase uptake of financial services. Build trust: In finance, trust is paramount. High-quality visuals, clear confirmations and frictionless onboarding reinforce user confidence. Balance and Transparency: Overusing urgency tactics or \u201cdark patterns\u201d can erode trust. Ethical design focuses on helpful nudges rather than manipulative tricks. Sustainable Engagement: Dopamine-driven design should improve financial wellness and user satisfaction, not pushing impulsive actions. Long-Term Loyalty: Positive \u201cmicro-rewards\u201d around money management encourage recurring, long-term usage of your platform.

Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. WASHINGTON: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining The Market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

In 2025, its parent company, Alphabet, is a vast multinational technology conglomerate and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. While much of Alphabet\u2019s growth was internal, it also added to its empire through shrewd acquisitions, including of Android, DoubleClick and YouTube. Since 1998, it has acquired at least 267 companies . Alphabet is a key player in many digital markets, including general search, browsers, online advertising, mobile operating systems and intermediation. Google Search, for example, is now the most widely used general search engine in the world. Globally, its market share has been at least 78% for the past 10 years . Unsurprisingly, antitrust agencies, whose task is to protect competition, have been taking a close look at Google\u2019s conduct and that of other tech giants. While having market power is not illegal if it is the result of a superior product, protecting such a position by means that are not meritorious is.

It provides an introduction to the diversity of research coming out of the continent and considers some of the key issues facing European countries. Get the newsletter! Google\u2019s conduct under scrutiny In recent years, there has been growing concern that Google may be using anticompetitive means to protect and extend dominant positions in core digital markets. In 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , the European Commission fined Google over \u20ac8 billion for abusing dominant positions in key markets \u2013 more than any other Big Tech company to date. A fourth investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the advertising technology market , in which the European Commission is likely to request structural changes to Google\u2019s advertising business, is nearing completion. The national competition agencies of the EU member states have also actively enforced EU and national abuse-of-dominance rules. Private antitrust class actions for damages are adding to Google\u2019s woes. In 2022, the EU enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to create an additional tool for intervening against entrenched market power in core platform markets. The DMA regulates the behaviour of so-called gatekeeper companies, aiming to make markets more contestable for competitors and fairer for users. In September 2023, the European Commission designated Alphabet as a gatekeeper in no fewer than eight platform markets for the following services: Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Google Ads, Chrome, YouTube and Google Android. Within days of the DMA\u2019s conduct rules becoming binding on Alphabet in March 2024, the European Commission opened the first noncompliance investigation to assess whether Google Search was continuing to treat Alphabet\u2019s own services more favourably than its rivals\u2019, and whether Google Play prevented app developers from steering consumers to other channels for better offers. For the Trump administration, EU rules amount to non-tariff restrictions The territorial scope of these rules is limited to services offered in Europe. They do not regulate how Google operates in the United States \u2013 this is subject to US antitrust law. Nonetheless, the European Commission\u2019s enforcement actions have provoked the ire of the current US administration. In February 2025, the White House issued a memorandum titled \u201cDefending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties\u201d that takes issue with European antitrust and regulatory measures against US companies. According to the Trump administration, the EU\u2019s rules amount to non-tariff restrictions and unfair exploitation of US companies, and they interfere with American sovereignty. The memorandum stresses that Washington will not hesitate to impose tariffs and other actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States. According to the European Union, such actions would amount to economic coercion and interfere with its legislative sovereignty to decide under what conditions services are offered on European soil. In 2022, likely with the possibility of a second Trump presidency in mind, it enacted the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument , which allows the European Commission to impose a wide range of \u201cresponse measures\u201d, including tariffs and restrictions on imports, exports, intellectual property rights, foreign direct investment, and access to public procurement. Such response measures could be imposed on US digital services. Potential for escalation The situation has the potential to further escalate the risk of a trade war between Europe and the United States. However, the dispute over tech regulation does not appear to be about substantive antitrust principles per se. In 2020, the US House of Representatives issued a bipartisan report stressing the need for the United States to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice subsequently brought antitrust lawsuits against all four companies, most of which are still pending. The Department of Justice filed two separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020 and in 2023 . In the first case, a Washington DC district court in August 2024 found Google guilty of violating section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and established that Google had attempted to protect its monopoly power in the market for general search through anticompetitive means. Judge Amit P. Mehta is now determining appropriate remedies, and the Department of Justice recently reiterated its request that the judge break up Google . The second US case against Google is still pending. The accusations in it are similar to those underlying the European Commission\u2019s ongoing investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the market for advertising technology. While the case was initiated during the Biden administration, it has not (yet) been shut down since Trump returned to power. It\u2019s also worth noting that the new head of the Federal Trade Commission has stressed that Big Tech is a main priority of his agency . There seems to be concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Google has been restricting competition. The crux of the discord, most likely, is that European regulators are telling US companies what to do \u2013 even if on European territory. Europe lacks equivalents to Big Tech The European Commission appears determined to keep enforcing its antitrust rules and the DMA. On March 19, 2025, it informed Alphabet that its preliminary assessment had shown that Google\u2019s behaviour in search and in the Google Play Store was incompatible with the DMA. Also, the first noncompliance decisions against Apple and Meta under the DMA are expected shortly \u2013 even though the fines may well stay below the maximum 10% of a company\u2019s global annual turnover allowed by the act, in view of its novelty. Europe is not an insignificant market for Google and other US tech companies. In 2024, Google reportedly generated 29% of its global revenue, or $100 billion , in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Europe has no equivalents to Google or other Big Tech companies, and the EU today imports 80% of its digital technology . In September 2024, the Draghi Report issued a stark warning to bloc leaders, highlighting waning geopolitical stability and the need for Europe to focus on closing the innovation gap with the US and China in advanced technologies. Less than five months later, the European Commission published the Competitiveness Compass , a roadmap to restoring Europe\u2019s dynamism and boosting economic growth. Strong measures from the White House in retaliation for European antitrust and regulatory enforcement might just give this process additional impetus. President Trump cannot make European tech great again, because it never was great. But his policies may unintentionally help make it so.

They care that it works and provides what they expect. They expect real-time updates, simple account management, and zero surprises. And public transit operators like you must adapt to meet these demands. That means fast, accurate, and intuitive tools that keep buses, trains, and riders moving. That\u2019s where a closed-loop automatic fare collection system can help you. Yet, choosing the wrong system can lead to unplanned delays, inconsistent experiences, and diminished trust in your services. To deliver a frictionless travel experience, it\u2019s crucial to focus on features that prioritize user convenience and accessibility. The right solution should do more than collect fares. It should streamline operations, protect revenue, and enhance rider experience without any complexity. In this blog, we break down five essential features every transit operator like you should look for when evaluating a closed-loop AFC system . These insights will help you make informed decisions th at align with your operational goals and enhance overall service quality. Why public transport needs smarter auto fare collection systems Modern public transit must balance operational efficiency with an exceptional rider experience. And increasingly, that balance depends on how fares are collected and managed. Balancing the 3Cs : Cost, control, and convenience In simple terms, automatic fare collection with closed-loop payments operates with transit fare cards or e-wallets. Unlike open-loop systems, which rely on bank-issued cards like Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc., these systems are managed by your transit agency. With a closed-loop payment system , businesses like yours can gain: Full control over fare structures, discounts, and exemptions The ability to retain more of the fare revenue by avoiding third-party processing fees Direct engagement with riders, independent of external card networks In short, it's a more sustainable and flexible model for businesses looking to modernize fare collection without sacrificing autonomy. Growing demand for seamless, digital transit experiences Consumer expectations are shaped by convenience and the experiences they get in different aspects of their lives. What tech giants like Amazon and Uber offer becomes a baseline. So it\u2019s not going to be any different for them when it comes to transit payments. Mobile-first and contactless interactions, instant account updates, and smooth transfers across services are now baseline expectations. And legacy fare systems? They simply weren\u2019t built for this. As transit networks grow more multimodal\u2014spanning buses, metro, trams, and ferries\u2014there\u2019s an urgent need for fare collection technology that keeps up with evolving rider behaviors. So what separates a good closed-loop AFC system from a great one? Let\u2019s look at the five must-have features. Real-Time Account Management and Stored Value A truly convenient closed-loop AFC system lets your passengers manage their fare wallet like any other digital account\u2014with instant access and full transparency. Here\u2019s what the systems should support: Preloading funds to a card or mobile account Real-time balance updates across all transit modes Auto top-ups, low balance alerts, and quick refunds Bonus: This approach also enables unbanked or underbanked people to use cashless automated fare collection systems through prepaid options. This makes public transit more accessible to everyone. Fare Flexibility with Smart Rules and Capping Fare rules shouldn\u2019t be locked into rigid structures. A robust closed-loop AFC system allows operators like you to configure fare logic that adapts to real-world travel patterns. Here are some key capabilities that you can prioritize: Zone-based, time-based, or distance-based pricing Daily, weekly, or monthly fare capping Seamless transfers between modes or agencies Ability to run promotions, off-peak discounts, and loyalty-based rewards This flexibility isn\u2019t just operationally smart; it builds rider trust by offering transparent pricing and tangible savings. Multimodal Integration and Interoperability Your customers shouldn\u2019t have to think about switching cards or apps when transferring from a bus to a train, or across regional lines. Closed-loop transit cards or e-wallets make it easier and seamless to pay the fare across different modes of transport within the same network. Closed-loop transit cards or e-wallets enable: Unified access across multiple modes: metro, tram, ferry, bus, etc. A single e-wallet or card that works system-wide Regional partnerships that make cross-jurisdiction travel seamless This level of integration is what transforms public transit into a true network, rather than a disconnected set of services. Mobile-First Access and Contactless Options We\u2019re well past the era where physical cards and vending machines were the norm. Smartphones are the default for making payments for most people now. This means that operators like you should go for a system that allows: Boarding via QR codes or NFC tap-to-pay from e-wallets Virtual transit cards stored in rider apps App or web access to trip history, reloads, and account settings It\u2019s not just about convenience. It\u2019s also about reducing reliance on hardware, which helps lower long-term costs for you. Rich Reporting and Operational Insights Automatic fare collection isn\u2019t just about moving money\u2014it\u2019s a source of valuable intelligence for decision-making. Your AFC system should provide: Real-time dashboards tracking boardings, trip duration, and fare types Historical trends to inform service adjustments Reporting by user groups (e.g., student riders, senior passes) By analyzing this data, transit companies like yours can optimize routes, staffing, and fare policies based on actual usage\u2014not assumptions. And with built-in tools to support promotions and loyalty rewards, you can run targeted campaigns to attract new riders or retain frequent ones. For example, bonus rides after 10 trips or discounts for early commuters can drive engagement and loyalty. The long-term advantage of a closed-loop fare collection system Short-term efficiency is important. But smart operators look ahead, and a closed-loop auto fare collection system offers more than just smoother payments. Cost savings and revenue control When you manage the fare ecosystem in-house, you bypass costly interchange fees and reduce reliance on payment processors. According to industry estimates, third-party card fees can eat up 2\u20133% of every fare. That is a silent but significant cost that closed-loop systems can eliminate. This also allows you to define fare exemptions, subsidy policies, and concession fares without interference from external institutions. Data ownership and security A closed-loop system means the data stays with you. Travel patterns, top-up behavior, fare category usage\u2014all of it can be stored securely, analyzed, and used to improve service. With better encryption and tighter system controls, the risk of breaches or fraud is also significantly lower than in open payment networks. Future-proofing for urban mobility The best closed-loop AFC platforms aren\u2019t just built for now; they\u2019re built for what\u2019s next. Whether it\u2019s integrating with bike-share programs, enabling smart city dashboards, or supporting real-time intermodal planning, these systems scale as your network grows. And as rider expectations continue to shift, systems that evolve alongside behavior will become your most strategic asset. Final words At its core, fare collection is about more than payments\u2014it\u2019s about how riders experience your system and how you, as an operator, shape that experience. Closed-loop payment system give you the strategic control to design smarter pricing, retain more revenue, and build deeper relationships with passengers. And they do it while reducing friction, lowering costs, and setting your network up for long-term success. So when you\u2019re evaluating AFC solutions, don\u2019t just check for compliance or compatibility. Ask: Does this system put us in control \u2014 and does it empower our riders? Does the system put you in charge? Does it anticipate future demands? Does it respect your bottom line? The answers will determine whether you\u2019re investing in a tool or a true partner for growth. External This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra.

Randeep Hooda has accused the makers of 'Kesari' of sabotaging his own film on the Battle of Saragarhi after he had already completed a significant portion of the shoot. Akshay Kumar , Ananya Panday , R Madhavan starrer 'Kesari: Chapter 2' is set to release in theatres on April 25. The second installment is a biopic on C Sankaran Nair and is a completely different story line from the first installment. However, it takes forward a lot of patriotic sentiments which are synonymous to both. Ahead of the release of 'Chapter 2', here's when you can watch ' Kesari '. One can watch 'Kesari' on Amazon Prime Video now. The film had originally release in 2019 and starred Parineeti Chopra alsongside Aksay. It was directed by Anurag Singh. It made around Rs 200 crore worldwide gross. The film takes forward the patriotic essence of 'Kesari' which was based on the Battle Of Saragahi. Recently, the film is in the news, not just because of the release of ' Kesari 2 '. But also because Randeep Hooda has dropped some allegations on the makers of 'Kesari'. According to the 'Highway' actor, he had begun the film on 'Battle Of Saragarhi' much before. But he alleged that the makers of 'Kesari' played dirty wit him. He said that he completed 30 to 40 percent of the shoot and then it was shelved abruptly. He told Shubhankar Mishra, \"Woh picture ki shooting bhi hui. Woh lalchi logon ke lalach ki vajah se nahi bani. Usme main akela hi Sikh tha. Baki koi Sikh nahin tha.\u201d Randeep said that he gave up his role in the sequel to Extraction to be able to do justice to this film, but it was shelved. Thus, the actor was quite depressed.

While she excitedly pointed her camera toward the Parisian skyline, I was struck by how technology has transformed our concept of distance. Her world, at eighteen, is infinitely more connected than the one I knew at her age. I couldn\u2019t help but smile at the timing of this call, because today Amazon Q Developer is expanding to Europe . The launch of Amazon Q Developer Pro Tier in the Frankfurt (eu-central-1) region marks a significant milestone for our European customers, addressing two critical needs: data residency and performance optimization. For organizations that need to meet EU data residency requirements, the ability to store customer content within EU boundaries can help provide the assurances they require. Beyond compliance, this regional presence brings performance benefits. European customers will experience reduced latency in their interactions with Amazon Q Developer, as requests are processed closer to home. This proximity not only improves response times but also enhances the overall development experience, making real-time interactions with Amazon Q Developer more fluid and natural. Amazon Q Developer Pro tier users now have the choice of creating a profile in N. Virginia (us-east-1) or Frankfurt (eu-central-1). Your content \u2013 including customizations \u2013 is stored in this region. While your content is stored in Frankfurt, Amazon Q utilizes cross-region inferencing to optimize request processing. At launch, this includes Frankfurt, Ireland, Paris and Stockholm, as shown in the following image. Finally, it is important to note that certain operations, such as querying AWS resources in other regions (e.g. \u201cList my S3 buckets in Tokyo\u201d), will naturally involve cross-region calls regardless of your Q Developer profile\u2019s location. The Frankfurt region includes all GA features except the command line and the ability to chat with Support . You can read more in the Amazon Q Developer User Guide . We invite you to experience these new capabilities by upgrading to the Pro tier and selecting Frankfurt as your region during profile creation. Get started with Amazon Q Developer , and share your feedback with us as we continue to expand our global presence.

It\u2019s a phrase middle managers use to talk about adapting to change in the workplace. Plus, the origin story of the name William , and why it\u2019s Guillermo in Spanish. And a five-year-old poses a question that puzzles a lot of people: Why is the letter Q so often followed by a U ? All that, and adynaton , an assonant quiz, do it up brown , salt of the earth , haven\u2019t grown gills yet , wooling , a silly joke about the number one, a poem about regret, and hide-and-seek calls, such as Ole Ole Olson all in free! This episode first aired June 12, 2021. It was rebroadcast the weekends of May 21, 2022, and April 13, 2025. https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/s.gum.fm/s-6335fc48c324eacdf1c68c6c/traffic.megaphone.fm/WAYW6538392079.mp3 When Pigs Fly and Las Vacas Vuelen In English, if we want to say that something will never occur, we say it\u2019ll happen when pigs fly or when hell freezes over . In Spanish, you can express this idea by saying it will happen \u201cwhen cows fly,\u201d or el d\u00eda que las vacas vuelen . In Italian, the same idea is reflected in a phrase that translates as \u201cwhen donkeys fly.\u201d In Malay, that event will occur \u201cwhen cats grow horns,\u201d in French \u201cwhen chickens have teeth,\u201d and in Bulgarian \u201cwhen the pig in yellow slippers climbs the pear tree.\u201d This rhetorical device is called an adynaton , from a Greek word that means \u201cimpossible.\u201d Haven\u2019t Grown Gills Yet Kamela works as a nurse in Anchorage, Alaska. When she asked a patient how how he was doing post-surgery, the man responded with Well, I haven\u2019t grown gills yet . It\u2019s a jocular way of acknowledging that although he hadn\u2019t recovered completely, things could definitely be worse. More Impossible Events Two examples of adynaton, the rhetorical term for playful exaggeration suggesting that something will never happen, involve animals\u2019 tails. One German expression translates as \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when the hounds start barking with their tail,\u201d and a Latvian one translates as \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when an owl\u2019s tail blooms.\u201d The Business Expression \u201cMoving Someone\u2019s Cheese\u201d Alyssa from Dallas, Texas, is puzzled by some jargon she hears in her workplace. As a management consultant, she\u2019s often warned by her bosses to make sure that employees don\u2019t think that management is moving their cheese. The phrase references Spencer Johnson\u2019s 1998 bestseller, Who Moved My Cheese? ( Bookshop | Amazon ) This motivational fable is the story of two mice and two tiny humans caught in a maze, and how they adapt \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 when their usual food source is moved to another location. Making One Disappear How do you make the number one disappear? Hint: add a letter. Two-Word A Puzzle All the answers to this puzzle from Quiz Guy John Chaneski are two-word phrases, and the only vowel they contain is the letter A . For example, suppose John is lounging in a shaded spot where only one variety of fruit is allowed. Where is he? How Are \u201cWilliam\u201d and \u201cGuillermo\u201d Related? Justin in Dallas, Texas, is curious about the origin of the name William , and why the Spanish version is Guillermo . Its popularity goes back to the days of William the Conqueror. Modern languages have several versions of this name, such as German Wilhelm and Dutch Willem. For a good explanation of the phonetic changes that led to these different versions, check out Trask\u2019s Historical Linguistics by R. L. Trask, revised and edited by Robert McColl Miller.

Auden\u2019s poem \u201cAs I Walked Out One Evening\u201d contains some lovely examples of the rhetorical device called adynaton, which are impossible things, including: I\u2019ll love you, dear, I\u2019ll love you / Till China and Africa meet, / And the river jumps over the mountain / And the salmon sing in the street . Do It Up Brown The phrase do it up brown can have two very different meanings: to \u201cdo something to perfection,\u201d as in something that is perfectly cooked, and \u201cto swindle\u201d someone or beat them at their own game \u2014 metaphorically leaving them \u201ccooked.\u201d Salting the Earth vs. Salt of the Earth The phrase salt of the earth describes someone who is essential and pure of heart, a reference to the biblical Sermon on the Mount. To salt the earth usually means to render the ground useless, whether metaphorically or literally. David Ray\u2019s Poem, \u201cThanks, Robert Frost\u201d Following up on our discussion about the many meanings of the word regret , we share David Ray\u2019s poem \u201cThanks, Robert Frost,\u201d which addresses hope for the past as well as hope for the future. This poem was read with permission of the author . All Out Are in Free Hide-and-Seek Call Kit from Pulaski, Tennessee, recalls that when he played hide-and-seek as a youngster in Miami, Florida, the call he and his friends used at the end of the game to draw everyone out of hiding was All y\u2019all come in free! . However, he\u2019s aware of other versions and wonders if they\u2019re all variations of one original phrase. There\u2019s no written record of an original version, and since this phrase tends to get passed along more often by word of mouth more than in written form, it can be highly variable. The Dictionary of American Regional English lists dozens of versions, including Ole Ole Olson all in free and all-ee all-ee ump free and all home free . Adynaton Origin and Meaning The word adynaton , which refers to a jocular phrase that emphasizes the idea of impossibility, was adopted into English from Greek, where adynaton means \u201cimpossible,\u201d a combination of a- meaning \u201cnot\u201d and dynatos , which means \u201cpossible.\u201d This Greek word derives from a root that means \u201cto have power,\u201d the source also of the English word dynamic . One Hungarian adynaton translates as \u201cwhen it\u2019s snowing red.\u201d A Russian version translates as \u201cwhen a crayfish whistles on top of a mountain.\u201d In Serbian and Croatian, the same idea is expressed by a phrase rendered in English as \u201cwhen grapes grow on willow.\u201d The Roman poet Virgil expressed the idea of something doubly improbable with the idea of \u201cwhen golden apples grow on oak trees.\u201d Stop Wooling Me! Tabitha from Palmer, Alaska, remembers her mother used to exclaim Stop wooling me! , a phrase used in parts of Appalachia, the Southeast US, and the Ozarks to mean \u201cstop bothering me,\u201d \u201cstop roughhousing,\u201d or \u201cstop tussling.\u201d Why is Q Followed by U? Quinn from Excelsior, Minnesota, is five years old \u2014 well, five and three-quarters, as she points out. She wonders why the letter Q is so often followed by U . In Old English, the alphabet didn\u2019t include the letter Q. The word quick , for example, was spelled cwic . The QU combination was introduced as a result of the Norman invasion, when many French words and language custom reflected the influence of Latin and helped create modern English. Latin, in turn, had been influenced by the Etruscans, whose alphabet included the letter qoppa . Two wonderful books about the evolution of the letters we use today are Letter Perfect by David Sacks ( Bookshop | Amazon ) and Michael Rosen\u2019s Alphabetical: How Every Letter Tells a Story ( Bookshop | Amazon ). This episode is hosted by Martha Barnette and Grant Barrett, and produced by Stefanie Levine.

Associated Tim Mc @ XTAR direct on 14/04/2025 - 20:38 XTAR direct is legit. I've ordered the SC1 Plus from them before in 2023. I bought an XTAR VP2 back in 2014, PB2S and VC8 around 2022 from other stores. Then I reviewed the VC2L, VC8S, SC1 Plus, MX4, and VX4. adventurer on 14/04/2025 - 23:01 The problem with this is the 1A limit. I have tested this VC4 charging Eneloops. Sadly this charger is actually slower than Eneloop fast charger. tunzafun001 on 15/04/2025 - 09:51 And doesn't do LiFePo4. There was some charger on Temu that could. armageddeus on 15/04/2025 - 10:28 What happens if you put Lipos in this? Any damage? Know which one on Temu does? Thanks tunzafun001 on 15/04/2025 - 16:27 It was a PowerKan 4 This is only one of them. A few options available https://www.temu.com/au/power-kan-factory-m-634418211613058.\u2026 sAmiZZle on 15/04/2025 - 11:31 Was about to buy this yesterday but went for the Vapcell S4+ V3.0 from Sofirn with a 15% discount code that popped up on their website. Granted it is double the price, but I figured worth it since it is more stable on power supply (dedicated AC/DC adapter) as opposed to the USB cable this VC4 relies on. If you are looking for portability this VC4 is a great charger especially for this price. yangguchunyang7612 on 15/04/2025 - 14:37 Had one high end charger from this brand and experience was terrible. The battery (fully compatible with what they advertised) was charged for few hours and wouldn't stop, i can hear some abnormal sound coming from insidce of battery and i feel it's going to explode wtf Lps on 15/04/2025 - 16:17 yeh, wtf Login or Join to leave a comment Login Join Related Products XTAR VC4 by XTAR Top Deals Active or upcoming Electrical & Electronics deals from the last 30 days.

Needed a data drive for video editing to put in the internal slot of the dock I got for my M4 Pro Mac Mini, this should do just fine. Since it doesn't get as hot as the Pro version, seems like a perfect fit in the enclosure, and at only $6 more than what Crucial offers ( https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pl...1_3?sr=8-3 ), it's also faster. I've come to trust Samsung SSD drives more than other brands. I have a few that have lasted more than a decade and don't show signs of slowing down. Of course read/writes make a big difference, but still, I've had other drives from Team, Edge, etc. that have failed in less than 2 years.

Despite hopes for deregulation, Trump\u2019s appointees remain committed to scrutinising tech giants. AI companies like Nvidia and Microsoft are also under investigation. Navbharat Times The Trump administration isn't letting up on the tech giants. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission will face off with Meta in court over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. And on April 21, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should force Google to sell its Chrome web browser to limit the power of its search monopoly. Both cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Donald Trump's first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google's ad technology business. Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and setting proactive regulations for tech. But so far, Trump's appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry's hopes. Live Events \"I think that they may not have fully focused on how much the first Trump presidency had to do with setting in motion this reexamination of tech ,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Here's what to know. Who is in charge of antitrust enforcement now? Trump appointed Andrew Ferguson as chair of the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints. \"I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we've got going,\" Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast \"Odd Lots\" this year. The new leader of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Gail Slater, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Trump's first term. She has also pledged to enforce antitrust laws aggressively. \"It's now a bipartisan issue, and there's a consensus around the need for robust antitrust enforcement,\" Slater said at an event hosted this month by Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup accelerator, which has pushed for more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. Where do the major antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants stand? Five government cases accuse tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies, and all are moving through the courts. The companies deny the allegations. The FTC sued Meta in 2020, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 violated the law by using what regulators call a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate its nascent rivals. The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The Justice Department sued Google in 2020 over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a roughly three-week hearing on how to address Google's monopoly. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal. The Justice Department accused Google in 2023 of illegally dominating the advertising technology business. A federal judge heard arguments in that case last year, and a ruling is expected soon. The FTC accused Amazon in a 2023 lawsuit of squeezing small merchants that use its marketplace to sell to consumers. A federal judge rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case last year. It is scheduled to go to trial next year. The Justice Department sued Apple last year over claims that the company's interwoven ecosystem of technology makes it hard for consumers to ditch their iPhones and iPads . Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. What about tech industry mergers and acquisitions? The Biden administration tried and failed to block numerous tech deals, including Meta's purchase of a small virtual reality startup, Within. The push to stop acquisitions outraged investors who back small companies that want to cash out by being acquired by a tech giant. Trump's appointees say they want to get out of the way of acquisitions that don't present a competitive problem. Slater has expressed an openness to companies' proposing settlements -- such as selling off similar assets -- which can help resolve concerns about deals. In late January, the Justice Department sued to block the business software company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper Networks, a networking firm, for $14 billion. It was the first lawsuit to challenge a tech deal in Trump's second term. During the first Trump administration, the Justice Department unsuccessfully challenged AT&T's purchase of Time Warner. What does this mean for the artificial intelligence race? Last year, the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide up responsibility for investigating whether the biggest players in artificial intelligence were violating antitrust laws. The Justice Department started investigating Nvidia , while the FTC took Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI. It is unclear whether those investigations will result in lawsuits. The Trump administration has promised to clear the way for American companies to develop AI, including rescinding a Biden-era executive order that put guardrails on the use of the technology. The administration has solicited the industry's input on how best to move forward with policy around the technology, an opening that companies and investors took to lobby for fewer rules. \"I think it is extremely important that we protect competition in the AI space, but I think it is equally important that the government not race to regulate AI,\" Ferguson said on Bloomberg TV in March.

The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8.30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. - 'Inspiration' - Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy\", whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams\". \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl\", will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission.

The EPA/DHA content in one softgel is pretty good for the size though. Comparable or sometimes higher than similar sized softgels you can buy from Costco.

My experience is that the tablets isn't noticeably smaller. consider twice the packaging material and the fact volume is radius to the third power, if i put two side by side, you gonna be pretty hard to see the difference. (the image they use is to against their bigger tablets, which is possibly larger than what Costco has).

Natural fish oil causes burps which is good. NatureMade said that they use a thicker capsule so that it dissolves slower, carrying the fish oil farther into the digestive tract. They are thicker than flax seed, pumpkin seed, and Omega 3 oils that I have taken. This is the first I've heard about additional chemicals. But the way that people just make up unhelpful and even hurtful BS and post them on this site helps me understand why society is going down the toilet. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply aerischan Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:24 PM 544 Posts Joined Sep 2008 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:24 PM aerischan Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:24 PM 544 Posts Quote from Peregringo : This is the first I've heard about additional chemicals.

The EPA/DHA content in one softgel is pretty good for the size though. Comparable or sometimes higher than similar sized softgels you can buy from Costco. The pills at Costco with higher EPA/DHA content tend to be bigger and can be hard to swallow. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply seanleeforever Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 7:36 PM 4,889 Posts Joined Dec 2009 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 7:36 PM seanleeforever Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 7:36 PM 4,889 Posts Quote from aerischan : The EPA/DHA content in one softgel is pretty good for the size though. Comparable or sometimes higher than similar sized softgels you can buy from Costco. The pills at Costco with higher EPA/DHA content tend to be bigger and can be hard to swallow. My experience is that the tablets isn't noticeably smaller. consider twice the packaging material and the fact volume is radius to the third power, if i put two side by side, you gonna be pretty hard to see the difference. (the image they use is to against their bigger tablets, which is possibly larger than what Costco has).

Natural fish oil causes burps which is good. NatureMade said that they use a thicker capsule so that it dissolves slower, carrying the fish oil farther into the digestive tract. They are thicker than flax seed, pumpkin seed, and Omega 3 oils that I have taken. This is the first I've heard about additional chemicals. But the way that people just make up unhelpful and even hurtful BS and post them on this site helps me understand why society is going down the toilet. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply aerischan Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:24 PM 544 Posts Joined Sep 2008 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:24 PM aerischan Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:24 PM 544 Posts Quote from Peregringo : This is the first I've heard about additional chemicals.

I use them as 'meat' in tacos with the regular taco seasonings, I put them in rice or quinoa with a can of tomatoes, they're great in salsa and sometimes I eat them plain.

Sounds like two issues to me, neither one being this extension. First, flat head screws are a pain, even when un/screwing straight without an extension/adapter. You really have to get the right sized flat head, and even then you'll have issues. Second issue could be if the flat head bit isn't of good quality. If the issue were this extension, it would most likely break apart itself, not the tip. A torx but would probably fare better, especially if the bit itself were impact rated. I could be wrong, but I've stripped the heads of a few flat and Phillips head screws and bits in my day. Hex and torx, I mostly lost, lol. 6 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Old_Snake308 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 10:47 AM 459 Posts Joined Nov 2009 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 10:47 AM Old_Snake308 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 10:47 AM 459 Posts Imo this is a tool to use when you actually need the pivot function, not an extension to leave on your driver full time. The mechanism has a lot of play even when locked so it doesn't mesh that well with the fastener. 4 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Taco 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 11:39 AM 846 Posts Joined Oct 2003 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 11:39 AM Taco 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 11:39 AM 846 Posts I use it more than I thought I would.

The holder is impact rated, but there's a chance the tip is not. If you want good impact rated tips, go with Bosch. However, nobody uses flat head screws if they can avoid them. I don't even think they make them hard enough to need an impact. And you certainly don't need that much driving force for dining chairs. 3 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link boriskey Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 5:21 PM 592 Posts Joined Jun 2007 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 5:21 PM boriskey Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 5:21 PM 592 Posts returned mine, it is too flimsy for any practical use 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link smartt Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:12 PM 2,724 Posts Joined Nov 2010 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:12 PM smartt Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:12 PM 2,724 Posts I'm such a sucker for these tools accessories.

Hiking Over 60: A New Book by Philip Werner Philip Werner April 14, 2025 Blog My new book \u201c Hiking Over 60: A Modern Guide to Hiking Gear and Techniques for Active Adults \u201d is out and free on Amazon today. It\u2019s a book for new hikers as well as more experienced ones who want to come up to speed on the lightweight hiking gear revolution that has occurred in the past 10 years. Gone are the days when you had to carry a crushing weight to go hiking or use heavy leather boots that felt like you were wearing cinder blocks on your feet. Hiking gear, clothing, tools, and techniques are much lighter weight and simpler than they used to be, making hiking more accessible than ever for mature hikers. Hiking is also very budget friendly, since you can get started with a pair of sneakers you already own and hiking is free in most local or state parks, conservation areas, and national forests. In addition to its physical benefits including better weight control, aerobic health, and enhanced muscle strength, hiking has mental and social benefits that become increasingly important as we age. Hiking gets you of the house and away from your TV, computer, phone and the constant interruptions we all experience in the \u201cattention\u201d economy. It also strengthens your social connections which can be difficult to maintain, but are so important when we get older. Hiking is a great way to expand your social circle with people from all walks of life, and to maintain your ties to family and friends. Hiking Over 60 is divided into two parts. Part 1 \u2013 Hiking Fundamentals covers the basic skills you need to plan a hike, use a map, choose hiking footwear and clothing, pack food and water, and how to go to the bathroom outside. Hiking safety is also addressed including blister prevention and treatment, how to pack a first aid kit, and who to call in an emergency using conventional means like a cell phone or a satellite messenger. Part 2 \u2013 Hiking Gear Guide goes into much more depth about hiking footwear, clothes and layering, how to use trekking poles, what to look for when choosing a backpack, hydration and water filtering, GPS navigation apps and devices, and satellite communicators. There\u2019s also a section on medical support gear including leg braces, compression sleeves, and straps to minimize pain and keep older hikers on the trail longer. Hiking Over 60 includes hiking gear recommendations throughout the book based on my experience reviewing hundred and hundreds of hiking and backpacking gear products on my website, SectionHiker.com . My goal there and in Hiking Over 60 has always been to help people understand what is real and what is BS when it come to penetrating the wild claims made by many hiking and clothing manufacturers. I\u2019m also a pretty frugal guy by nature, so if I recommend gear or clothing, you can rest assured that its the real deal. So, if you\u2019re like me and over 60 years of age, I hope you find Hiking Over 60 enlightening and useful. In the words of one of my readers, \u201cage is no barrier to hiking.\u201d You can do it if you try, and I hope that my guidance will speed you on your journey. Hiking Over 60 is currently available on Amazon as an eBook. A paperback version is in the pipeline and should be available next month.

Reply Jesse April 14, 2025 at 3:46 pm Description makes it sound like it\u2019s a very general hiking guide book, but the title makes it sound like it\u2019s specifically aimed for older readers. Which is closer to truth? Got the ebook, but I think this question might be on others mind as well and thus worth asking in public. Reply Philip Werner April 14, 2025 at 7:24 pm Both. There\u2019s no doubt that anyone would benefit from reading it. It\u2019s quite loaded with relevant information that any hiker or backpacker needs to know. But it\u2019s written for a specific audience. No doubt about it. A lot of people over 60 don\u2019t know how much the hiking world, culture, and gear has changed in the past 20 years. This brings them up to date. Reply Rob Z April 14, 2025 at 6:59 pm Thanks! Just downloaded a copy, will leave a review. Reply Philip Werner April 14, 2025 at 7:27 pm Thanks Rob.

Transcript of Interview with Tara Cremin Joanna: Tara Cremin is the director of Kobo Writing Life, Kobo's independent publishing platform. Welcome back to the show, Tara. Tara: Thanks, Jo. Thanks for having me. Joanna: Oh, it is great to have you back on the show. It's actually been four years, which is crazy. Tara: I can't believe it. Joanna: I know. So I thought we'd go back to the beginning. Tell us a bit more about you. When did you get into the book business, and what are some of the changes you've seen for authors since then? Tara: Sure. So I've been working for Kobo since 2012, which feels like a lifetime. When I started, the company had created some great, but kind of relatively simple, eReaders. They were just starting to dip their toe into really expanding what physical devices could do. Then you fast forward to 2025, and we're the second largest manufacturer of eReaders , after our friends in Seattle. So part of the work that I do on Kobo Writing Life, I've been working on it basically since day one. Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform for authors who wanted to publish directly to Kobo readers. So I've been kind of working on that. The biggest change on the author side that I can really think of is just the expansion of the tools. I think it's easy to not always think back to 2012 because things move so quickly. I'll be like, \u201cOh, that was ages ago,\u201d but it'll be like four years ago. When you're actually thinking about 2012, authors were uploading a Word doc and publishing their ebook, and then that was it. There wasn't a lot of different things available or more opportunities. Now, authors can really easily create accessible and like really beautifully designed ePubs with tools like Vellum and Atticus . They can publish audiobooks to Kobo, they can reach libraries, join subscription programs, and take advantage of all the promotional tools that are available. So I think the biggest change is just that there's more opportunities now for authors than when I started working in the book business. Joanna: Oh, and\u2014 What about the growth of Kobo for indies? I mean, we've heard before some of the stats around the number of self-published books on the Kobo platform. That's grown as well, hasn't it? Tara: It has. I have some stats for you. When we look at self-publishing on Kobo, it makes up about 25% of the units for single copy sales . Then if we think about the subscription reading, it makes up about 60% of English language subscription reading is all self-published content. It's huge . Joanna: Wow, that's incredible. So indie authors are important to Kobo, I guess we could say. Tara: Yes, and it started with somebody wanting to email a Word doc and get it published, which is why Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform. We've really been able to expand it and add additional features. Kobo has always taken a global stance of the digital book market, and I think we realized pretty early that the indie authors were really integral to that. Something that I don't think we talk about a lot because I'm primarily focused on the English language side, but we also have a portal that's just for users in Japan that's very self-contained in Japanese. Last year, we actually localized in traditional and simplified Chinese for our friends in Taiwan and Hong Kong. So the Kobo Writing Life platform is now available in eight languages. So we know how integral the independent authors are to the global book business. Joanna: Kobo originally was Canadian, right? Then it was bought by a Japanese company. Tara: Yes, so we're still headquartered in Toronto. We have a global presence, where we have offices in Taiwan, in Tokyo, Darmstadt and Dublin, and with a generous sprinkling of people throughout Europe. We were acquired by Rakuten, maybe prior to me joining, 2010, 2011, and we've been sort of their digital book area of that ever since then. So having this enormous company backing has been really, really helpful, but we do maintain quite a Canadian-centric grassroots focus with the HQ being here in Toronto . Joanna: Absolutely. So one of the changes you mentioned has been the subscription model. As you mentioned, our friends in Seattle have one that's quite famous that is an exclusive program. Kobo Plus is not exclusive, so people can be in that as well as selling their ebooks elsewhere, which I love. How does Kobo Plus subscription compare to some of the other subscription models for ebooks and audiobooks? Like, what is it for readers and listeners? Tara: Sure, I think it's maybe important to see why people have gone down the subscription route, for people that are potentially a little bit hesitant of that. So when we're thinking about the book business as a whole, or Kobo's history, I think in about 2015 we could see that there was a whole generation of consumers that were coming that were consuming most of their media by not purchasing it once at a time, and they were signing up for subscriptions . Whether this be music or movies or TV shows, I think we knew that books and audiobooks were going to go this way. As a retailer that was really doing a great job at selling books one at a time, we wanted to reach this subscription consumer without disrupting the business we had built and doing it in a way that benefited us, the publishers, the authors, but also the readers who were looking for this. So we tested this in a contained market. So it was launched back in 2017 in the Netherlands. This is because we had a really great market share there. A strong, willing partner, Bol, who wanted to test this out. One of the also key factors was that there's some of the biggest piracy rates in Europe were found in the Netherlands. So we wanted to see if we could convert those users who were already sometimes using Kobo devices. They're reading, they're just not paying for the reading. So we wanted to see if we could make this very easy, self-contained platform, could we convert them to paying users? Then what we found from that is that it really didn't cannibalize the a la carte sales. We had new customers signing up, and we could kind of see where they were coming from. Some of them were coming over from Kindle Unlimited, some of them coming from piracy. Some of them had been maybe just library users that had been moved into this kind of easier one click model. Some of them had never read an ebook before, but used it as a way to step their toe into the digital reading. What we found is that \u2014 Publishers and authors, they all earned more as a result of the new readers [on subscription]. So what we looked at with these findings was\u2014gosh, it'll be almost 10 years now, which is wild. Time doesn't exist anymore, Joanna\u2014but with the findings from the Netherlands, we've been able to expand Kobo Plus. As of this recording, we are currently in 23 countries , which is including all of our core markets. There'll be more to come, probably shortly after this comes out, actually, but I can't quite say where. So 23 countries right now. Like you've mentioned, we're not the only subscription model out there, but what makes us a little bit different is the focus on the importance of the authors and wanting to give them flexibility, while also trying to reach this subscription reader. So it was really important to us that we didn't lock any authors into exclusivity. Our ethos around KWL is really trying to encourage authors to publish widely on as many platforms as they can, to reach as many readers as they can. We just want to make sure that the Kobo experience of you publishing widely is really easy and that you're not spending too much time on it because you're balancing all of these other platforms. So we built this out so authors can pick and choose the country. They can choose all of them if they want, which is what I would always recommend. If you're a wide author that's publishing globally, I don't know why you wouldn't put your books in, but perhaps you didn't want to hit up your main markets, like the US or Canada. You do have the option of like excluding those, or you can select all of them. What's a cool way about selecting all of them is that it actually includes future territories. So as we've been rapidly expanding Kobo Plus, you don't have to do anything. Your books are already there when we add to new places. So that's been pretty cool. We're not locking authors into any timed period. You can put your books in, and you can take them out if you're not happy with it. I always encourage people to leave them in, to really try to reach that readership. Again, we wanted to give authors as much control as possible, and really just get authors to try it out. Like try out an older series, maybe try it out in the Netherlands, where you haven't really thought about selling books before, and eventually get really comfortable adding their catalog to Kobo plus. So for us, it was really all about building author trust over time when it comes to subscriptions . I feel people are more comfortable with it now than before, and I think it's easy to get people comfortable when the revenue is increasing, I think. Joanna: So all my books that are on Kobo are in Kobo Plus . I also agree, I think there's a group of readers for whom\u2014readers and listeners, we should say\u2014because this is audiobooks as well, right? Tara: Yes, it is. Depending on the territory, but primarily they all have ebooks and audiobooks. So from a customer perspective, you can either pay for all you can read for a month, all you can listen for a month, or all you can read and listen. So those are the options. Joanna: Exactly. So this is the thing, I think as authors, we have to think about different groups of readers. So even as we record this, I've got a Kickstarter happening. There is an ebook, there is an audiobook, which will eventually be on Kobo, but for now, they're just on Kickstarter. Then there's a gorgeous hardback with foil and ribbon and all of that kind of thing, which Kobo doesn't sell beautiful hardbacks, right? I mean, and neither does Amazon, neither does Apple. [The special hardback vs subscription.] They're different audiences. It's a completely different audience, someone who's going to buy that hardback to someone who's going to borrow the audiobook in the Netherlands. Tara: Yes. I mean, I love seeing what authors are doing with these. That must be so satisfying for you to get that copy of this beautiful book. So, yes, we really wanted to just focus on the digital experience, especially when it comes to our devices as well. We make some of the best e-reading devices\u2014I mean, I would say they are the best\u2014but like, we're making the best eReaders that are available. We launched our first color eReaders last year, and the reception to them was just tremendous. So our eReaders have integration with ebooks and audiobooks . You can connect via Bluetooth to speakers or headphones. We also have Overdrive capabilities, like Overdrive is built into the e reader, so you can access the library from within Kobo. One of the things that we've been doing, l think we've just launched it maybe last year. You can tell I don't work on the device side, I'm not quite as sharp with my dates. It's always been very important for us to have it be this open platform. So having users be able to just use the eReader to read books, and if we can make it easy for them to purchase books with subscriptions and convert them to paying users, that's awesome, but we do have integration with Dropbox. With our newer eReaders, you can actually write notes with the Kobo Stylist, and you can mark up the files themselves, and there's integration within that. We've recently added Google Drive integration, which is super easy. I just used it the other day when I was giving a presentation, and I had my notes that I was able to convert over and read from my Kobo, which was really helpful. I was actually able to mark up and make changes as I'm going along on the Kobo eReader itself, which is pretty cool. Joanna: Of course, if people buy my ebook from the Kickstarter, they can read that on Kobo because it doesn't have to be like DRMed into \u2014that's too technical. It doesn't have to be a specifically Kobo ebook is what you're saying. Tara: No, no, no. We always just use the ePub standard. Actually, I shouldn't be saying that because you can also add PDFs and things like that. So, no, it's not a locked system. Joanna: I think that's really good too. So let's get into some of the other things. I mean, like we mentioned, the gorgeous hardbacks that are the current trend in the indie community. I mean, they really are kind of all people are talking about. You and I were talking about doing this episode because at the end of the day \u2014 The bread and butter income for most indie authors is still digital. It's like, we move on to the sexiest thing. In 2012 ebooks were pretty sexy, right? I mean, they were like, \u201cOh, we can do this, and we can do this.\u201d Then it was audiobooks and print-on-demand and all of that, and now it's gorgeous hardbacks. So let's just go back in to the sort of bread and butter. What are your tips for maximizing income from ebooks and audiobooks on Kobo? I know that's a massive question, but let's pick a few things. Tara: I think it's still really important to make beautiful books, even if it's digital . I mean because authors are primarily digital first. A lot of publishers are not. They're still really focused on the print. So I think it's really important to think about making a really great digital file, which, like I mentioned, it's just easier than ever now. You actually don't even have to think about it that much, the tools just do it for you. I think it's important to have a file that can be read easily because the last thing we want to do is have some sort of technical glitch that is interrupting somebody's hard won reading time. We really just want the person to be always trying to get the next book, so making sure the file itself is beautiful and working perfectly, I think is really important. I think it's important to consider making accessible files so that everyone can read your book . Digital reading opens up a world to people that might have limitations around physical book reading. There are a number of people that can only read digitally, and it just allows for a more inclusive reading experience. So something to be mindful of as well. Joanna: Just on that\u2014 Is there something special we need to do for accessibility for an ebook? Tara: So I have a book recommendation for everyone called Content For Everyone , by Jeff Adams and Michele Lucchini. We had them on the Kobo Writing Life Podcast, and it was just a great conversation. I would say to check out their book because it has a lot of practical advice for authors on making accessible content. So not even just the ebooks themselves, but also author websites and newsletters. It's really full of actionable tips. They are far more versed in this than I would be to try and reiterate some of their stuff. Joanna: Jeff's been on this show, and we talked about it then . I got the impression that if you use, let's say, Vellum or Atticus for your ebook publishing, that does cover the content, at least, of an ebook. Tara: Yes, yes, perfect. Joanna: Okay, great. So just to be clear, there wasn't anything extra we were missing. Tara: No, no. Just to make sure that that is kind of being done, and you're not creating files that are inaccessible. Joanna: Which, to me, it means that Kobo is still getting a ton of badly formatted files, which I thought we were way past that. Tara: It's not that it's badly formatted, I think you have to consider the millions of books that exist, and especially the older catalog. So newer books might be accessible, but the older books that you've created back in 2012 might not be. So a lot of the work we're doing is just an education around making sure that your book files are of the best content or the best quality that they can be, like before vellum existed. Joanna: Oh, yes. I used to use Scrivener back in the day. I know some people still do, but Scrivener, I used to get errors all the time. I love Scrivener for writing, but for listeners, I would say Vellum or Atticus is the best in class these days. Okay, back on to maximizing income. Tara: So I would say that \u2014 For Kobo, box sets are super popular. So when you're thinking about selling books one at a time, and authors primarily are writing in series, or that's sort of the trend that we see through Kobo Writing Life, you definitely want to bundle your books. Something to remember is that on Kobo, we don't have a higher price cap . So you can go over $9.99, and still earn 70% on each sale. So with the box sets, again, you want to make sure that you have an easy to navigate table of contents because this is a larger file that readers are browsing through. So you want to make sure that they're able to do that with ease. Which I'm sure, again, these tools can kind of easily create this for you, but just something to be mindful of when you're bundling the books together. Joanna: Yes. I think bringing up box sets is really good because the KWL promotion tab i s great. I go in every three weeks, and I apply for as much as I can get. Although, just so everyone knows, I don't get every promotion. Like nobody gets every promotion, right? You just have to apply for a ton of them. There are always box set promotions going on. Tara: Yes, we rotate around pretty regularly with them because our readers are just so interested in having box sets. It's funny because I think we think about box sets as like a discounted opportunity to have these books, but that's not really how readers are taking them. They're taking them as like this is a convenient way to have this one series in this one book . So I'd always recommend pricing them for their value and just making sure that they're available for the reader who doesn't want to like click on books one by one, and just have this bigger box set. Something to keep in mind with the covers is that we do accept the 3D box sets with the plain white backgrounds, but if you're thinking about promotions or applying to promotions, we might be a little bit less inclined to accept those, just because it makes your cover really small and it makes it harder to read. You already have limited space on a website in terms of a cover, so I really like to \u2014 Think of box set covers as they're almost as an ad for your series. So you can kind of use it as an opportunity to encapsulate the theme of your series within your box set cover. Joanna: Then just on that, just on Kobo Plus, we didn't say\u2014So a lot of authors are used to the \u2018pages read' idea. How is that done on Kobo Plus for reading and listening? Tara: The biggest difference, I guess, between Kobo Plus and some of the other platforms is that we base our payment on\u2014well, it's a very similar revenue share model\u2014but it's based on the minutes that your book has been read versus the page reads. This allows us to treat ebooks and audiobooks the same, and it kind of reduces a little bit of the gamification that we've seen on some other platforms . So we're really taking into account the time that somebody is spending on your book. Joanna: Yes, because some people were able to game other systems by sort of getting bots or paying people to click through pages and stuff like that. Oh, but it's funny, isn't it? I mean, whenever humans can find a way to game a system, they will. Tara: We're very clever people. Joanna: We are. We are very clever people. Okay, so\u2014 What about some other ways of maximizing income? Tara: So I would say with audiobooks that we're talking about, so you can publish audiobooks to Kobo as well, through Kobo Writing Life. You may not see the tab right away, and actually the same with the promotions tab, but you just have to send the team an email to enable this for you. If you email writinglife@kobo.com you can ask for audiobooks and for promotions. Just as we were talking about the box set covers there, I think something to keep in mind with audiobooks, we will crop the cover for you. If you want to make sure that you're making the best cover, audiobooks are square and not rectangular, so sometimes we do see kind of like a really squished cover. That would just be something to be a bit mindful of when you're publishing audiobooks, to just make sure that you're selling the book because we are unfortunately always judging books by their covers. Joanna: Yes, absolutely. I guess\u2014 One of the things I've noticed with Kobo is that the vast majority of my Kobo income is fiction rather than nonfiction. Is there a split like that? Tara: There probably is, but I feel like the nonfiction market for us is definitely growing, especially with our new devices. We've done a lot of work to try to cater to the nonfiction reader, and what we call like an immersive reading experience. You can see this with the writing within the book itself. There's easy ways to flip back and forth between the pages. We basically have the digital version of like a thumb in the side of the pages, so you don't lose your spot, but you can actually flip through the book and then flip back again. So it's definitely growing, but I think what we see, especially on Kobo Writing Life, it would be fiction that would be primarily what people are reading right now . Joanna: Well, I'll put another sort of ask in for the promotional tab, which is mainly fiction focused, I find. I do always look for nonfiction promotions there. To be clear, again, for people listening, I do think to sell books on Kobo, it is good to be part of the promotional opportunities . You can really get in front of new readers that way. So that would be one of the things I would like to see, is more nonfiction and memoir promotional opportunities. Tara: For sure. I will take this to the team. Joanna: Yes. Take the feedback! Let's talk about libraries because some authors are worried about libraries. I mean, obviously authors want libraries to have their ebooks and audiobooks, but they're also worried about the money. If an author goes with the library and Overdrive, how do they get paid for that? Tara: So it's really easy to opt your books in. It's part of the publication process, so it's in the rights and distribution section. So you just have to set a price in USD, and that'll be your library price for the book . The general rule of thumb is roughly around the same as a mass market paperback. You just want to make sure that you're not putting the same price as your just straight up digital book because of the loaning factor when it comes to the library books. Sometimes we have authors that want to appeal to libraries by putting it in at a lower price, and I always kind of remind them that the librarians have two ways of purchasing the books through Kobo Writing Life. So they can publish on a one copy, one user. This is kind of like when you think of a traditional book, that we have this one book and that can be loaned out multiple times. So that's why you want to increase the price because you want to cover the loans that are happening with that. They also have the opportunity to buy your book on a cost per checkout option, and that's for a one-time loan for 10% of the price. So if your library book is $19.99, they could also just buy your book for a one-time loan for $1.99. So that can really appeal to them. We have a lot of the library sales that are demand driven, so it's people actually going in and asking for your book. So it's really great to be able to offer to a librarian, like actually, you can buy it just this one time, and maybe you'll buy it a few times for the lower price. Then if it's really popular, then you'll buy it for the higher price again. So we see that happening quite a lot. Authors that distribute to Overdrive through Kobo, they earn 50% of any sale that happens. Joanna: Yes. So just to put people's mind at ease \u2014 You can support libraries and get paid. So this is one of the ways you can say to people, you can listen or read my books for free. Just ask the librarian to stock them, or just go to your library app. I think that's a good one. I wanted to come on to the authors who do really well on KWL. What are the commonalities that you see amongst top selling authors? What do you see working that we can model? Tara: Well, like you've mentioned, the promotions tool that we have. I was trying to think about instances of authors that have moved widely in the past couple of years and are finding success on Kobo, and they're honestly the ones that have leveraged their promotions. It can take a little while to build a Kobo audience , and I just always recommend applying to the promotions that are relevant to your books and applying regularly. I like to think about it as, like, the worst case scenario is that you're putting your books in front of the right eyes. It can just be quite competitive because there's a lot of people applying, but it's our merchandising team that are going through them. So I definitely would say the ones that are building the audience and finding success on Kobo are really leveraging the promotions with us. Then also, that's audio and library promotions that we have too. I think if you're publishing audiobooks, and I know this can be really tricky to balance, but if you can make sure that you're publishing your ebook and your audiobook on the same day and do those same releases, I think that's really important to building sales. We found authors that have kind of reported that it's a bigger impact for their audio when they do that versus when they release it at a later date or anything. So you can try and line them up as the one book release. Joanna: Well, then that brings me on to something, having obviously done audiobooks for many years. Sometimes I narrate them myself, sometimes I have paid people, but recently, and in fact, my Death Valley audiobook \u2014I haven't told you this\u2014but it is narrated by my voice clone, my AI voice clone . Today, as we record this, I put a couple of chapters up on The Creative Penn Podcast, so people can have a listen. I've already had comments that say, \u201cI would not have known this was an AI. It sounds exactly like you.\u201d This will be, I think, the first time in however long I've been doing this now, 2007, I've been able to publish ebook and audiobook on the same day. Tara: Oh, wow. Joanna: Because, as you said, it is incredibly hard to do that because most of us, in the past, we've maybe sold the ebook first, made some money, then eventually been able to pay for the audiobook. Before Kobo, when you could put it up there, you put them on another platform, they never went live on the same day. There was a long time we couldn't do preorders. So, I guess we're coming onto the AI discussion because AI-narrated audiobooks, certainly for me, ElevenLabs, the difference in the amount of work and pain for me as an audiobook narrator is incredible. So I don't know if I'm ever going to human-narrate again. I mean, it literally is fantastic. So let's come on to AI. What is Kobo's stance on AI-assisted ebooks, AI-narrated audiobooks, AI-created covers? I know this is a tough question, but we have to cover it. Tara: AI is definitely the biggest thing that is disrupting the book industry at the moment. When it comes to us at Kobo, we kind of go back to the core principles of what makes a reader's life worse, and can we avoid it? And what makes a reader's life better, and can we take advantage of it? So AI, we know, will open the floodgates to lots of books being published that are like purely machine generated, which really impacts organic discovery, especially for indies. Part of the upside of this is that it becomes a curation problem, and that's something that we're here for . We're here to solve that problem. So with Kobo Writing Life specifically, we accept AI audiobooks, and we just ask that they're clearly labeled that it's machine read. It's really just a customer expectation or just have something that's mentioning that it's a machine read audiobook. We do discourage the publication of ebooks that are solely generated by AI, and this is just trying to root out the bad actors . We're not trying to root out any authors who are serious about making a career with their works, but we're just trying to discourage the people that are bad actors within this space. So when we think about it from an indie author perspective, I think it's good practice to include disclosure, which I think is something that you do, Joanna. I think of you as like a leader in the best practices in this space. Joanna: I do try. Just on the audiobook, so I have a button, like a yellow button, that says \u201cdigitally narrated.\u201d It's so funny because I see now in the traditional publishing industry they're saying, \u201cOh, we need labeling,\u201d and I'm like, I've been labeling my books for years. I mean, come on. Like before it was required, I ticked all the boxes and talked about it. Also, I don't have an issue with that. I think honesty is really important. Also, I feel like all these things make my work better. I'm not doing it to try to scam anyone or be worse. I'm trying to be better. I do think, though, we are in a transition period. I think this will be so pervasive within a year or two that it won't make that much difference. For now, I guess, as you say, it's marking this. So I will be filling in whatever I need to fill in. Tara: Yes, I think it's good practice. I mean, it is a personal decision, and I think you just have to think about the reader. You just don't want to disappoint the person that is buying your book. Like, that's what it ultimately comes down to for us. Then we also know that it's okay to use AI as a tool, especially with indie authors who have to balance writing with the entire business of also being your own publisher. So whether you're using it as a tool to create you a calendar or spreadsheet that makes sure that you're hitting all your preorder dates. There's things that can make your life easier because you have to wear so many hats. So we understand that as well. So when I think about AI, like from a book selling perspective, I think the interesting opportunity comes in how we can leverage AI in some of our recommendations, like summarizations and curation . So I can't really go into too much detail on what we're working on yet, but we're really excited about better recommendations and curation that really benefit us all. We just want to keep people's attention on long form reading by putting really good stuff in front of them, and we can do this without using books as training data inside an LLM. So, yes, we're excited about this. Any Kobo Writing Life authors that are listening, you can expect some changes for to the Kobo Writing Life terms to come. I hope that things aren't seen as anything that's too scary. We're really trying to just support some new initiatives and be really, really clear about what we're asking for. We're not interested in making new content. We don't want to make things from books that authors entrust us with. What we do want to do is make reading better and keep people reading more and for longer. We're trying to earn a space in reading amongst everything else that's going on in the digital world, and we really believe that we can do this. Joanna: Yes, I like that. It's interesting, though, because you mentioned there about\u2014and this is obviously important\u2014that you're not going to just upload everyone's books to some big LLM and do stuff with it. You're not going to do that. It's funny because for many, many years, I've said, \u2018why is the book itself not the metadata?' So we've had to come up with categories, keywords. We've had to have genre-specific covers. The thing is, if I have a book, say Death Valley \u2014it's like 70,000 words, it's a full length thriller\u2014and I have to write a sales description, which is\u2014well, in fact, Claude writes my sales descriptions now\u2014but it's not long enough. What you want with some kind of AI curation recommendation engine is the emotional promise of this, the characters in this, the feeling you get by reading this, matches these books over here, which just will not be surfaced in a normal book recommendation engine. In fact, for the last year or so\u2014 I've been using ChatGPT as my main book recommendation engine because it can do this much more nuanced search. I found really some quite old books as well have come up. So is that something that\u2014I know you're not going to read everything in\u2014but what do you think about that? Tara: I think you're spot on in the kind of way that the book recommendations can be going and can be leveraged. We just want to make more thoughtful recommendations. It's interesting that you're saying that it's older books too, because that's something that we see with the subscription with Kobo Plus when I look at some of the top read books. They're often coming from like 2017, 2018. So there's ways to resurface things that exist that people want to read . We can do this in a thoughtful way and an easier way than us having to rely on metadata that's been provided. If I want to be able to find a list of like Canadian authors, it's not as easy as potentially it can be. There's instances like that. It's all about, again, trying to find the right book for the right reader and just keeping them reading . That's what we're focused on. Joanna: At the end of the day, I mean, we're book people, and it kind of drives me up the wall when authors get annoyed with other authors. I'm like, look, let's get upset about how much time people spend gaming or how much time people to spend on TV. We just want everyone to read. Whatever they read is good. We just want people to read books. I know, obviously, that's what Kobo wants as well. Tara: I think it was like on Threads or a meme or something that I read recently, where it was like, reading is almost radical now . In a time where we just want faster content and we're consuming things faster, it's a bit radical to be like, actually, I'm going to sit down for two hours and just be immersed in this world and really think about myself and expand my thoughts on other things because I'm not going to be distracted by four things at once. It must have been some meme that, ironically, grabbed my attention for this radical thought process. Joanna: That's ironic. Tara: I know, but I was just like, that's right. It's something that we don't do. I mean, it's, I guess, comparable to going to the movies and like actually sitting there and not being distracted. It's the same sort of thing where it's radical to take that time for yourself, and we want people to be able to do that. Joanna: We're almost out of time, but I just wanted us to mention the Kobo Writing Life Podcast. Since this is a podcast, people might enjoy the KWL Show, and that has been going for many years now. What can people find over on the KWL Podcast if they want to click over and have a listen? Tara: We just released episode 366, which is wild. So you can find us anywhere where you listen to podcasts . We release an episode every week, but we rotate between new interviews, and then we've been resurfacing some of our great content from our backlist with a little thing we're calling the Kobo Rewriting Life Podcast. So there'll be a new episode, a Rewriting Life new episode, and so on and so forth. There's a wealth of really good information. We focus on the craft and business of writing. It's a mix of traditional authors and indies. Jo, you've been a guest, and we'd love to have you back. I think you're going to come on soon. Joanna: Yes, at some point. Tara: I think for anyone that is interested in Kobo, or maybe you're new to what we do, at the end of 2024 we released an interview with Michael Tamblyn, who is our CEO. He is probably a little bit more eloquent than me in explaining the things that we've just talked about. He really gives a great outline of Kobo, Kobo Writing Life, and I just really like being able to spotlight that because it really informs the fact that Kobo is a book company, and we're being led by a book guy. I think that's something to be celebrated, and just kind of shows our overall focus into the reading space. Joanna: Well, we should also remind people what Kobo is an acronym for. Tara: Literally, it's the word \u2018book.' Joanna: I feel like we forget to say that because we know it, but there might be people listening who didn't know. Tara: I worked there for years before I realized that it was actually an anagram of the word book. I think I was definitely three years in before it hit me. I was like, oh, right. Joanna: Oh, yes, that's what it is. Michael Tamblyn is\u2014I've been at London Book Fair\u2014and he's often the very best speaker in publishing. I mean, he really is very entertaining and very positive about indie authors, which I really appreciate. I've heard him defend indie authors to the publishing industry. So I love that, and I'm obviously a happy KWL user. So Tara\u2014 Where can people find the Kobo Writing Life team if they want to connect? Tara: So you can email us at writinglife@kobo.com . We're on most of the socials. We haven't quite ventured into TikTok yet, but you can find us on Facebook and Instagram and Threads and YouTube. If you are interested in creating an account or learning more about it, you can go to Kobo.com/writinglife . Joanna: Brilliant. Thanks so much for your time, Tara. That was great. Tara: Thank you.

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Electrical & Electronics Security Camera TP-Link 15 Apr 8:00am Related Stores Amazon AU Marketplace Comments GordonR on 14/04/2025 - 16:31 Have three wireless Tapo cameras, the driveway one gets the most action (despite my attempts to reduce the sensitivity and range) and runs out of battery. Can I buy solar panel only to attach to existing camera? luismuv on 14/04/2025 - 16:34 +3 Yes https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0D6WGRTW5 Timtamdoritos on 14/04/2025 - 16:58 +3 Bought 1 from eBay almost a year back(21 AUD). Still working great. I have one more tapo camera and doorbell so when battery goes down on others I just replace with the one connected to solar panel.So, don\u2019t have to wait for batteries to get charged. Stays 100% most of the days. bobvegas on 14/04/2025 - 16:35 +2 These aren't as smart as eufy's, many more false alerts if you're only interested in being alerted for people. lint on 14/04/2025 - 16:37 Do these at least continue recording for as long as motion continues to be detected? The Eufy cameras max out at 2 minutes per detection, which is bad if you need to record an entire event. bobvegas on 14/04/2025 - 16:49 These are also 2 minutes, which doesn't seem to make sense given the solar panel, I quickly had a look at mine, I do have it set on 'optimal' but the time can still be adjusted manually and it only goes up to 120 seconds lint on 15/04/2025 - 10:06 Thanks. Shame they put such a limitations on these battery cameras despite the possibility of charging with solar. Tyrx on 14/04/2025 - 16:54 If you need to record an entire event, you shouldn't be using battery cameras like this. The won't start recording until a few seconds after the motion is detected. lint on 15/04/2025 - 10:06 True, but the limitation on how long they can record for after they do actually start recording is a bit baffling. Jimothy Wongingtons on 14/04/2025 - 16:57 I run eufy and imou and I found get a lot of false alerts everyday fwiw bobvegas on 14/04/2025 - 19:28 +2 With the eufy's I get false alert but you can at least see how the AI made the mistake, like cats, dogs, birds, possums , at least they're mammals and it happens if they get up close to camera but with the Tapo's sometimes it's wind blowing plants, but other times it's nothing at all, it gets worse when it rains. It will sometimes detect cars as people which is a problem when I only have People detection set. They all make mistakes but Tapo is much worse in comparison to Eufy as far as AI detection, but the Tapo's are so much cheaper though. ozmma on 14/04/2025 - 21:50 I have a Tapo C120 and it constantly detects pigeons and neighbour\u2019s cat as people\u2026 super annoying. I ended up turning off notifications completely. Now I just use it to manually check around the house or scrub through recorded footage if needed. It supports RTSP streams, but they\u2019re really unstable\u2026 even with a high-end router just 5 feet away from the camera. If you\u2019re serious about surveillance, you\u2019re better off with PoE cameras on a wired network and backed by a UPS. That setup is much more reliable. That said, some camera brands are buggy even with PoE, so it\u2019s worth doing your research. Frigate devs there recommend Dahua and Hikvision for their stream stability, but those cameras can be pricey. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. seriousquokka on 14/04/2025 - 18:08 Yeah, my indoor C210 all of a sudden started to get false alerts, a few times a day in mid day. But I couldn\u2019t see anything moving, not even the sunlight/shadows. So I pointed it to the wall now. zuby on 14/04/2025 - 17:01 Are the recordings encrypted so you can only view with tp=link app. Or can you view the recordings with 3rd party app eg VLC etc hyq1031 on 14/04/2025 - 17:05 saw lots of bad reviews with the battery life. Kanosha on 14/04/2025 - 17:59 Battery life is OK. I maybe get around 1.5 months (45-50 days) of battery life before I need to charge it again. Definitely nowhere near the \"up to 300 days\" of battery life it claims. Funnily enough the doorbell that I have from Tapo lasts more than twice as long (around 3 months) before I need to charge that. Juice08 on 15/04/2025 - 08:30 I would assume though with the solar panel it will last longer? Thinking of mounting this where I'd need a ladder to get it down to recharge. knackers on 14/04/2025 - 18:00 damn, i bought the camera only for $65 two weeks ago Grange Hermit on 14/04/2025 - 18:07 Feel your pain. I paid $107 for the whole kit at Bunnings recently. gimmedealspls on 14/04/2025 - 18:36 This is about to be an old model with the C460 that has just come out which is 4K Kanosha on 14/04/2025 - 20:21 Interesting. This even has \"24/7\" recording at 1fps. I suppose this detects things a lot more quickly but I also wonder how much more this feature will drain my battery. 3DL3 on 14/04/2025 - 19:49 +5 I do not have a subscription and can view remotely. deemax33 on 14/04/2025 - 21:39 I bought TP C426 KIT and was unable to view alerts remotely. Would you like to share how you got yours setup ? ldd-mn on 14/04/2025 - 21:43 +2 Set it up using the Tapo app and turn on notifications. Done. deemax33 on 14/04/2025 - 21:45 @ldd-mn: I did the same, and it takes me to the subscriptions page for rich notifications. When I\u2019m outside, I can\u2019t access the cameras, but when I\u2019m connected to the home Wi-Fi, I can. deemax33 on 14/04/2025 - 22:31 @deemax33: Thanks all - for some reason the mobile data was off for the app! It\u2019s working as expected , guess I\u2019ll keep the camera now :) thesab on 14/04/2025 - 18:41 Can anyone confirm this will record to an NVR? sexymrdaniel on 14/04/2025 - 18:51 +1 Nah, it won\u2019t. I have one of these and didn\u2019t do the research before I bought it. According to TP-Link this one won\u2019t support streaming to an NVR because of some battery constraint. https://www.tp-link.com/au/support/faq/2680 thesab on 14/04/2025 - 19:01 Thanks for confirming! ozmma on 14/04/2025 - 21:54 Don\u2019t regret it! even if you had bought a Tapo camera with RTSP support, it still wouldn\u2019t have worked reliably. Pidapipo on 14/04/2025 - 21:12 Anyone knows a suitable mount to attach this to the gutter? I can mount the camera under the eaves, but we don\u2019t have a good location for the solar panel with the gutter and eaves running around the front where I want to install the camera. Looking into it I have found gutter mount for Eufy and ring camera, but not Tapo. Dolt2020 on 14/04/2025 - 21:32 I probably have the same issue but had seen references to generic gutter mounts from past security camera deals - so I've been looking to see what's available on Temu and Aliexpress - pretty sure I'll be able to get something suitable, just want to get a hands on look at the camera tomorrow - what I've been seeing are gutter clamps with various types of plate mounts for the camera/solar panel. Hopefully someone with first hand experience (for this cam) might post something a little more specific Pidapipo on 14/04/2025 - 22:39 I have seen third party mounts on Amazon that look like they can hold the solar panel. I would hate to open the box and forfeit my chance of returning the kit if they don\u2019t work for my place \ud83e\udd14 philmarcracken on 14/04/2025 - 23:46 gonna set these up as a webcam so I look like a criminal zoomer ThiccDicc69 on 15/04/2025 - 00:27 +2 Is this sold out?

Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email The mission is first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. Washington, United States: Pop star Katy Perry will be the biggest name in an all-female group set to touch the edge of space Monday, roaring into the cosmos on one of billionaire Jeff Bezos' rockets. The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. 'Inspiration' Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy,\" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.\" \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl,\" will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission.

Historically, they have indeed been precious metals. However, they are not the only ones. There are elemental metals that are rarer and more expensive than gold. They have important industrial uses\u2026.and in some cases, they are much more expensive. Learn more about platinum, palladium, and rhodium, the other precious metals, on this episode of Everything Everywhere Daily. I\u2019ve previously done episodes on both gold and silver. Most of you are familiar with gold and silver, and there is a good chance many of you own at least a little in the form of jewelry, coins, or silverware. Silver and gold are two of the seven metals that were known in the ancient world, the others being iron, lead, copper, tin, and mercury. Gold and silver were *the* precious metals for thousands of years. However, starting in the 18th century, scientists began discovering a whole host of new elements, including new metals. In this episode, I\u2019m going to focus on three metals: platinum, palladium, and rhodium. There are other metals which some might consider precious, including rhenium, osmium, and iridium. However, by the end of this episode, you\u2019ll see why I\u2019ve decided to focus on these three elements. I\u2019m guessing that most of you have heard of platinum, some of you have heard of palladium, and most of you probably don\u2019t have a clue what rhodium is. All three of these metals are in the platinum group of elements on the periodic table, along with ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. Before I get into what they have in common and their primary use, I\u2019d like to go through the history of each metal. The first known use of platinum predates European awareness by centuries. Indigenous peoples in pre-Columbian South America, particularly in what is now Colombia and Ecuador, worked with platinum-like alloys as early as 600 BC. Archaeologists have uncovered jewelry and artifacts composed of a naturally occurring mixture of platinum, gold, and other platinum group metals. However, due to platinum\u2019s high melting point and chemical inertness, these ancient artisans did not isolate it but instead used native metal alloys found in alluvial river deposits. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the 16th century, they encountered these mysterious white metals in the rivers of New Granada, or modern-day Colombia. The Spanish called the metal platina , meaning \u201clittle silver,\u201d viewing it as an impurity mixed with gold. They considered it a nuisance and even discarded it. Some records suggest they tried to artificially transmute platinum into gold, unaware of its distinct properties. Platina is the root of the word platinum. Despite this early encounter, platinum remained unappreciated and misunderstood in Europe for nearly two centuries. Platinum entered the scientific consciousness in the 18th century. Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish naval officer and scientist, is often credited with introducing platinum to Europe. In 1735, during a scientific expedition to South America, he observed the metal and brought samples back to Spain. His report, published in 1748, drew the attention of chemists and mineralogists across Europe. In the mid-18th century, William Brownrigg and Charles Wood conducted early studies of platinum in England. They noted its high melting point and resistance to corrosion, key traits that hinted at its future usefulness. In France, chemist Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Chabaneau made significant progress in refining platinum by the 1780s. He was among the first to succeed in producing malleable platinum by painstakingly removing impurities such as iron, gold, and other platinum group metals, allowing it to be shaped and used for practical purposes. In 1803, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston discovered a more efficient method for purifying platinum using aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride. Platinum, along with the other metals in the platinum group, as well as gold, are often called noble metals because they are very resistant to corrosion. Despite its scarcity, platinum gained traction in coinage and jewelry in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Russia, under the reign of Tsar Nicholas I, platinum rubles were minted between 1828 and 1845. These were the first major coins made from platinum, using Russian reserves from the Ural Mountains, where platinum had been discovered in the early 1800s. In the decorative arts, platinum\u2019s bright luster and resistance to tarnish made it a favorite among jewelers, especially in the Edwardian and Art Deco periods. Its strength allows for intricate designs that securely hold gemstones, which makes it highly desirable in high-end jewelry. Platinum is slightly more common in the Earth\u2019s crust than gold, having an abundance of 5 parts per billion. It has the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is silver, dense, malleable, and non-corrosive. As of the recording of this episode, platinum had a spot price of $948.00 USD per ounce, although it has reached as high as $1300 per ounce. Palladium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston the guy who is credited with the discovery of the purification of Platinum. Wollaston was working on refining platinum ore from South America using aqua regia to dissolve the platinum and then chemically separating other elements from the solution. While experimenting, Wollaston identified a new metal with distinct properties. To confirm its novelty and avoid public skepticism, he first anonymously offered samples for sale in a London mineral shop under the name \u201cpalladium,\u201d after the recently discovered asteroid Pallas, which itself had been named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athena. Only later did Wollaston reveal himself as the discoverer. Although initially met with some controversy and disbelief, because the scientific community was suspicious of anonymous claims, the uniqueness of palladium was eventually confirmed. Over time, it was accepted as a new element and added to the growing catalog of metallic elements essential to chemistry and metallurgy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, palladium was occasionally used in jewelry, often alloyed with gold to create \u201cwhite gold.\u201d Its brightness and tarnish resistance made it a preferred material for fine settings and wedding bands. It was used in coinage as well, primarily in commemorative or bullion coins issued by countries like Russia, Canada, and Sierra Leone. Palladium is more plentiful than platinum at 15 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust. It has the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46. Its properties are very similar to those of platinum. As of the recording of this episode, palladium had a spot price of $903 per ounce, with a peak over $3200 per ounce. Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, the year after he discovered Palladium. He discovered it by analyzing the same samples of platinum ore, imported from South America, using the same techniques he used to discover palladium. After removing platinum and palladium from the solution, Wollaston noticed a rose-colored compound remaining in the residue. Through further analysis, he isolated a new, previously unknown element. He named it rhodium, derived from the Greek word rhodon , meaning \u201crose,\u201d in reference to the pinkish color of its chloride salt, rhodium chloride. Rhodium\u2019s chemical symbol is Rh, and its atomic number is 45. It is extremely rare, estimated at about 0.7 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust, rarer than gold or platinum. Rhodium is one of the most reflective metals known, making it ideal for mirrors and coatings. Like the other platinum group metals, it is corrosion-resistant, resisting attacks from most acids and atmospheric elements. It is also not rose colored as it is named, in its base metal form. Rhodium is not mined directly. It is obtained almost exclusively as a byproduct of platinum and nickel mining, which limits its supply. As of the recording of this episode, rhodium has a spot price of $5,250 per ounce, making it one of the most expensive elements regularly used in industry. It has reached prices as high as $27,000 an ounce. All three of these metals have similar properties: they are rare, silvery, and non-corrosive. However, they also share another attribute: they all have catalytic properties. They can accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed. In particular, all three of these rare and expensive metals are used in catalytic converters in automobiles. Catalytic converters are pollution control devices installed in vehicle exhaust systems that transform harmful emissions into less dangerous substances. These devices represent one of the most significant advances in automotive environmental technology since the 1970s. At its core, a catalytic converter functions through chemical reactions that occur when exhaust gases pass through its structure. These reactions don\u2019t happen spontaneously at exhaust temperatures, which is why catalysts are necessary\u2014they enable these chemical transformations without being consumed. The primary reactions occurring within a catalytic converter include oxidation reactions, which add oxygen to molecules like carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and reduction reactions, which remove oxygen from nitrogen oxide compounds. Through oxidation, carbon monoxide becomes carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Through reduction, nitrogen oxides break down into separate nitrogen and oxygen molecules. A catalytic converter\u2019s structure consists of several carefully engineered layers. At the center is the substrate or core, typically made from ceramic material formed into a honeycomb pattern. This design creates thousands of tiny channels through which exhaust gases flow. The honeycomb structure maximizes surface area within a compact space. When all the microscopic pores are considered, a modern catalytic converter can contain a surface area equivalent to several football fields. Some high-performance vehicles use metallic substrates instead, which offer better durability under extreme temperature conditions. The washcoat, a layer approximately 20-150 micrometers thick and composed primarily of aluminum oxide, covers this substrate. This washcoat serves multiple purposes: It increases the surface area even further, provides a suitable surface for catalyst adhesion, and can include additional components that enhance catalytic activity. The rough, porous nature of the washcoat creates an environment where gas molecules and catalytic sites can interact effectively. The actual catalyst materials are embedded within this washcoat. Platinum is an excellent oxidation catalyst, facilitating the conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into less harmful substances. Palladium performs similar functions to platinum and has become increasingly important as platinum prices have fluctuated. Rhodium specializes in the reduction side, helping to break down nitrogen oxides. These precious metals are used in extremely small quantities\u2014typically just a few grams per converter\u2014but their effect is profound. Temperature plays a crucial role in catalytic converter operation. These devices require heat to function properly, generally becoming effective above approximately 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). When a car is just being started, before the converter reaches this temperature, emissions are significantly higher. This has led to various strategies in modern vehicles, including positioning converters closer to the engine, using electric heating elements, or incorporating specialized materials that become active at lower temperatures. Not surprisingly, catalytic converter theft has become a significant and growing problem worldwide due to the high value of the precious metals they contain. These metals can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars per ounce on the black market, making catalytic converters attractive targets for thieves. The devices are relatively easy to remove from vehicles\u2019 undercarriages, often within minutes using basic tools. They also lack traceability, allowing stolen units to be quickly sold to unscrupulous scrap dealers. Hybrid vehicles, trucks, and SUVs are particularly vulnerable because they either contain higher quantities of these metals and/or have elevated frames that make access to the catalytic converters easier. It is possible to buy platinum and palladium bullion and jewelry. Platinum is more common as a metal for these purposes, but both can be found. Rhodium, because of its scarcity and price, is much harder to find, but it is possible if, for whatever reason, you wanted to own some. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium are all rare, expensive, shiny precious metals. However, that isn\u2019t why they are important. It is their unique chemical properties that make the elements in such demand, as they are largely responsible for the reduction in harmful emissions from automobiles.

Adams initially backed Trump\u2019s tariffs but later exposed inflated figures, arguing the real issue is U.S. consumerism\u2014Americans prefer buying goods over manufacturing them. Nations like China and Singapore are ditching the dollar, with ASEAN countries urged to prioritize regional trade, accelerating the decline of U.S. financial dominance. Adams forecasts skyrocketing food prices, homelessness, and violent crime as the dollar collapses, warning the U.S. faces global economic isolation. Adams urges immediate investment in physical gold and silver, predicting fiat currencies will fail, and endorsing Peter Schiff\u2019s hyperinflation warnings. In a fiery broadcast on Brighteon Broadcast News, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, issued a stark warning: President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies are accelerating a global economic decoupling that could plunge the United States into financial ruin. Adams argues that Trump\u2019s miscalculations\u2014including misleading claims about foreign tariffs\u2014are destabilizing international trade and pushing nations like China, Singapore, and ASEAN members to abandon the U.S. dollar. The fallout, he warns, could include hyperinflation, mass poverty, and supply chain breakdowns. The Tariff Sheriff\u2019s Reckoning Adams opened his April 14, 2025, broadcast with a satirical song titled Trump the Tariff Sheriff, mocking the president\u2019s hardline trade policies. But the tone quickly shifted to alarm. \u201cTrump breaks the world,\u201d Adams declared, likening the collapse of U.S. dollar hegemony to Humpty Dumpty\u2019s irreversible fall. The first critical fracture, Adams noted, came in 2022 when Western nations froze Russian assets, signaling that foreign reserves in dollars or euros could be seized at will. The second shock arrived with Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, announced on April 2, 2025. Adams initially supported the tariffs, believing Trump\u2019s claim that China imposed a 67% tariff on U.S. goods\u2014until he discovered the numbers were inflated. \u201cTrump\u2019s team calculated trade imbalances and called them tariffs,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d The real issue, he argued, is America\u2019s insatiable consumerism: \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to work in factories, but they do want to buy stuff made in factories.\u201d The Great Decoupling Adams pointed to Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister, who recently delivered a scathing critique of Trump\u2019s policies, urging ASEAN nations to prioritize regional trade and ditch the dollar. China, meanwhile, is anchoring an alternative financial system, backed by gold reserves and bilateral currency swaps. \u201cThe U.S. is going to be embargoed by the entire world,\u201d Adams warned. \u201cCountries are cutting the ropes\u2014they won\u2019t let America drag them down.\u201d He predicts skyrocketing food prices, rampant homelessness, and a surge in violent crime as the dollar collapses. Gold as the Last Lifeline Adams\u2019 most urgent advice? Buy physical gold and silver\u2014now. \u201cIf you don\u2019t own precious metals, you will be financially wiped out,\u201d he said, dismissing fiat currencies as \u201cgoing to zero.\u201d He endorsed Peter Schiff\u2019s Crash Proof 2.0, which forecasts hyperinflation and a dollar collapse, and urged listeners to stockpile tangible assets. His grim conclusion: \u201cTrump is conducting a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy.\u201d Whether by design or ignorance, the result is the same\u2014a world abandoning America, leaving its citizens to face the consequences alone.

The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy,\" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.\" \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl,\" will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024. All rights reserved.

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

However, the idea is more about levelling the global playing field by building a much more open, collaborative stack. Francesco Bonfiglio, CEO of cloud exchange platform Dynamo, an Italian cloud services company, says EuroStack\u2019s all about teaming up to create a European tech ecosystem alternative, including cloud. The concept answers a new wave of protectionist practice and sovereignty concerns that have increasingly come to the fore worldwide. \u201cWe need to do something. We understand the importance of digital infrastructures, and cloud in particular, as a new strategic infrastructure for the economy, societies, politics and democracy in general,\u201d Bonfiglio tells Computer Weekly. The hegemony of giant tech firms, often in the US, has continued to loom larger. In cloud, this is signified by the growing dominance of hyperscalers \u2013 especially Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google. Of course, the power of Silicon Valley stems in part from capital investments over decades that cannot today be easily replicated. However, that\u2019s not to say nothing can be done. What is EuroStack? A EuroStack pitch document came out in January 2025 which notes that 2024\u2019s Draghi competitiveness report identified that a failure to take \u201cfull advantage of the digital revolution\u201d is a key cause of Europe acquiring an \u201ceconomic laggard\u201d status. An industry-driven initiative, EuroStack therefore seeks to develop an integrated digital ecosystem, with an entire value chain encompassing software, services, hardware and solutions. According to the 100 or so organisations involved so far, the IT environment has become \u201cfundamentally extractive, with data and economic rents appropriated through unfair bargains between super-dominant providers and us, the dependents\u201d. A growing body of laws and regulations representing \u201cmultiple attempts\u201d at competition intervention have failed \u2013 and slowed home-grown companies further with compliance demands. \u201cFurther, the \u2018occupation\u2019 of spaces is massively accelerating as US hyperscalers are aggressively marketing AI tools and services as key to European growth and prosperity,\u201d it says. The topline objective is to boost security, redundancy and resilience, opportunities, sovereignty and governance through direct industry action, bottom-up rather than top-down. This should be supported by five policy pillars: Recognise and define a European digital industrial policy (EDIP) across European commission functions. Build strategic digital infrastructures, first by aggregating \u201cbest of breed\u201d existing assets and supporting them with integration platforms, then by increasing industry collaboration. Support this aggregation with public and private investments, including in costly parts of the value chain. Select aligned interventions and measure results in terms of business outcomes that drive economic autonomy. Seek cooperation with third-party states that share common goals. A successor to Gaia-X In a sense, EuroStack appears a successor to a more or less stillborn Gaia-X . Bonfiglio says the Gaia-X concept had \u201cthe political message\u201d but less of a clear action plan. One key for EuroStack is ensuring organisations and consumers trust digital services and platforms. Technological quality and innovation is available in Europe, if not always adequately commercialised. Also, many remain nervous about data handling, privacy and intellectual property (IP). \u201cWe need to make that simple,\u201d Bonfiglio says. \u201cWe need transparency, controllability and interoperability. And if you want to lock me in, I won\u2019t let you in.\u201d Cloud federation has to go beyond technical federation too because no single operator will invest in becoming interoperable with another without related business opportunities. Concretely, cloud services providers Aruba, Ionos and Dynamo have just introduced the Sovereign European Cloud API (SECA) as a best-in-class industry standard for cloud infrastructure management. The next requirement is for potential customers to be able to find the European solutions they need. Bonfiglio says providers all over the world can and perhaps should build their own version of EuroStack, even organisations from the US itself: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be hostage to these three private companies either.\u201d Cloud infrastructure services investment globally is still growing. Canalys reported 20% year over year to Q4 2024 and similar for 2025. However, 64% of that total spend is on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Bonfiglio estimates that European providers have less than a 10% share of the market \u2013 and that share is shrinking, with most European datacentre capacity already either owned or rented by hyperscalers. \u201cIn 2028, hyperscalers will likely control 75% of our datacentres. It\u2019s an application of ancient colonisation techniques \u2013 only now it\u2019s not tea plantations but GW and square metres,\u201d says Bonfiglio. \u201cBut we can start to change this now, leveraging our existing assets.\u201d Change will be tricky \u2013 what is the best way? Nicky Stewart, senior adviser at the Open Cloud Coalition, retains doubts regarding strategy. After all, managing change across 27 member states remains \u201cincredibly complex\u201d. Regulation needs harmonisation, or even strengthening, and addressing competition could be simpler, she suggests. \u201cCertainly the hyperscalers have become all-powerful in technology; there\u2019s been fast growth, enormous concentration, and, if you like, anti-competitive business practices,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cBuyers don\u2019t always want the homogeneous, one-size-fits-all answer when it can be better provided with better customer service \u2013 and often keener pricing \u2013 by other cloud providers.\u201d Stevenage-based cloud services provider Civo is also a member of the Open Cloud Coalition. Chief commercial officer Simon Hansford adds that options are needed, with digital sovereignty entailing differential data handling. Some data is far more important and private. The way you handle, store and share it should recognise that. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t travel abroad, but that we put more economic value on it,\u201d adds Hansford. EuroStack as it is envisaged would better recognise the value of data and related industries. If you do not have sovereignty over a given resource, you control how you drive value. \u201cA clear example might be Airbus. Europe decided to build its own aircraft, rather than becoming a manufacturing site or maintenance site for Boeing, which would have been very easy to do,\u201d says Hansford. Today, this appears to have been a good decision. Without recognition of value, it can be very difficult to develop a local ecosystem \u2013 from education, training and certification to OEM \u2013 that drives jobs and businesses beyond indirect sales and services. \u201cThe majority of Europe\u2019s cloud professionals are in sales, marketing, pre-sales engineering and the like. AWS and Microsoft might say they\u2019ve got 1,000-2,000 people in the UK, but if they\u2019re all pre-sales, there\u2019s no research or core engineering done there,\u201d Hansford points out. \u201cWe have got to start creating demand by moving money away from the hyperscalers into our local industry.\u201d Solange Viegas Dos Reis, chief legal officer at French infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provider OVHCloud, points out that Amazon, Microsoft and Google have power that extends beyond cloud as well. \u201cThey have more and more power, and use that to strengthen what they have in other markets too,\u201d she says. OVHCloud has signed up. With EuroStack, business and industry have finally understood the direct impact that politics, and indeed geopolitics , can have on economics, she says, adding: \u201cWe need to get rid of dependencies on other countries where the political pressure can have a direct effect on us.\u201d Freedom of choice and innovation might be achieved by having a more open provider or by developing some smaller stacks with collaborative interoperability and transparency, with \u201cgood strategic partners\u201d from outside the EU also involved. She notes that when your data is hosted on hyperscaler servers, there is a risk that your activity competes with one or more of theirs, because they are so large and dominant. Or that it can be accessed by other governments for reasons with which you would not agree. Data and digital sovereignty is about more than competition. \u201cEuroStack makes me hope that we may go faster and be more precise on the needs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ambitious, for sure, but it\u2019s driven by economics, business and industry, and with strong leaders. It\u2019s not just a couple of lawyers in the room trying to make more regulation.\u201d Tackling the issues with regulation, top down, has not worked so far. Of course, it\u2019s a challenge, not least because it involves companies from diverse sectors up and down tech stacks. And there will likely be resistance from some. \u201cWe must coordinate everyone and identify the common challenges and elements,\u201d Viegas Does Reis says. \u201cBut the objective will benefit all the world, the whole tech ecosystem.\u201d Mark Neufurth, lead strategist and programme manager for SECA at cloud services provider Ionos, agrees that EuroStack models an initiative that could benefit organisations worldwide, and that is important. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no [actual EuroStack progress] development as of now, Europe has to develop a \u2018target picture\u2019 in the light of current politics, which are changing fast,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise, we will be out of business in a matter of years in terms of digitisation and digital things.\u201d That\u2019s all while the hyperscalers are still coming to, for instance, Berlin or wherever to take advantage of local innovation, Neufurth adds. Meanwhile, EuroStack has seven layers and takes a \u201chuge work package\u201d to get it off the ground. Software, hardware and services must be defined, resourced and built. Local problems, including potential inertia, must be overcome. That said, there are already European designs for low-energy chips here, and the cloud API standard SECA , so that should all help, Neufurth says. Of course, economies of scale must be developed. Other organisations, in other countries, can and should develop similar initiatives, including the UK \u2013 but partnering is key. Overall, however, the vision will take years, even decades, to materialise, Neufurth adds. \u201cNonetheless, we need this. It\u2019s essential that we emancipate ourselves a bit from China and the USA,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be less of a single point for failures, and of course better competition.\u201d Read more about competition in the cloud market CCS Insight\u2019s Bola Rotibi looks at the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s plans to regulate the public cloud.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

Posted on Apr 14, 2025 Subscribe to Shopping Newsletter Caret Down 28 Flowy Dresses You'll Basically Live In All Spring Now that the sun's social battery has recharged, it's time to stock up on maxis and midis. by Daniel Boan BuzzFeed Staff Facebook Pinterest Link Unless otherwise specified, all sizes in this post are listed in women's. 1. A flowy maxi with whimsical tied straps \u2014 it'll be your go-to dress for the influx of bridal showers you're currently getting invitations to. The bodice is nice and stretchy, while the tiered skirt will basically float around you as if you're carrying your own personal fan. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Such a cute and comfy dress! It has a fun flow to the bottom of it, and the ties for straps add an extra dose of fabulous.\" \u2014 Kelsey Krucker Get it from Amazon for $21.78+ (available in sizes XS\u20134XL and 14 styles). 2. A V-neck dress featuring an adjustable twist-tie waist that comes in several cute polka-dot and floral designs \u2014 which are inarguably the two most springy patterns of all. Bonus points if you tie the belt into an adorable bow. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"For me, clothes pay for themselves based on the number of compliments that are received when an item is worn. I already liked the dress the moment I put it on, but all day long women commented about what a lovely and pretty dress it is (ooh, I like the color, ooh it\u2019s so pretty, ooh, that dress looks like the start of a whole new wardrobe). The compliments made the reasonable dress price feel like a bargain deal. I guess I\u2019m a sucker for polka dots and the power of hearing something positive during the day.\" \u2014 Isadelle Mercedes Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 19 colors). 3. A sleeveless number with a button-down design and tiered skirt if you're looking to put a unique semi-formal twist on the classic swing dress. Throw on some strappy sandals , grab a round rattan bag , and your official spring brunch 'fit is sorted. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I\u2019ve been buying lots of dresses on Amazon for an upcoming vacation, and this one hits the mark perfectly! ...This is sooo comfortable! AND it has pockets! The best part is that my husband was trying to be helpful and did laundry, and he washed and dried this dress and I found it smashed into the laundry basket three days later. Not only did it still fit, but it wasn\u2019t even wrinkled! Perfectly packable! Brb, gotta go buy all the other colors!\" \u2014 DiKat Get it from Amazon for $27.67 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 22 colors). 4. A short-sleeve button-up dress that's long and fluttery, yet lightweight and breathable, so you'll probably still be reaching for this in the fall. Reviewers say they've received tons of compliments when wearing it, and you may even feel like a \"fairytale princess.\" \ud83d\udc51 www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this dress on a whim and was a little skeptical about it. I have never received so many compliments on a dress before. I wore it on a trip to the Biltmore Estate with my husband and in laws and we honestly couldn't get through the day without someone stopping me every few minutes to ask where I got my dress or to tell me how gorgeous it was. It flowed beautifully on that windy day. I'm obsessed with it, I even bought two more in different colors. I highly recommend!!!\" \u2014 Maria Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes XS\u2013L and six colors). 5. An embroidered tulle dress so elegant and floaty it might make people curtsy or bow every time you enter the room. The vibrant floral embroidery is truly the epitome of spring, and the tulle will keep the skirt lightweight and airy as you flutter around like the spring fairy you are. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Note: Reviewers suggest having someone help you tie the corset lacing at the back. Some also say they had to adjust the straps for a more secure fit, so be sure to allow yourself time to make some alterations if necessary! Promising review: \"I don\u2019t ever write reviews but had to because this dress is literally EVERYTHING!! It\u2019s so pretty and the fabric is high quality. I just wish for more occasions to wear it!!\" \u2014 Norah Barnes Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in women's sizes 0\u201328 Plus and in 13 colors). 6. An open-back design with a halter neckline and a fabulous floor-length cut I guarantee you'll twirl around in every 15 seconds. No worries if you get dizzy and need a break \u2014 the fabric is super comfy and lightweight enough to lounge around in. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have been wanting this same dress from a store in the mall, but it was $118. I was leery about this, considering it was much cheaper in cost, but it is PERFECT! It fit absolutely perfectly. Great length, too. Keep in mind you can't wear a bra with it, and if you are larger-busted (I'm small, an A cup), then it may fit totally differently. It's thin and lightweight, but with skin-colored undies, I had no problem with lines or visibility. I'm considering buying it in another color.\" \u2014 Bullitt02797 Get it from Amazon for $32.99+ (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 34 colors). 7. An off-the-shoulder smock dress so springy and adorable, you might be crowned this year's May Queen. But not in the creepy Midsommar way. Actually, a flower crown would pair quite nicely with this... go ahead and book that flight to Sweden!! Reviewers especially love the side slit that's not only super breathable but also gives you ample room to show off your latest sandal purchase. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"Bought this for our couples beach photo session in Oahu and it was PERFECT!!! I received endless compliments whenever I\u2019ve worn this: to dinner, the farmers market, shopping\u2026anywhere and everywhere! The sleeves stay in place and don\u2019t ride up or fall down, very flowy. Buy two!!! You won\u2019t regret it! :)\" \u2014 Christi Get it from Amazon for $43.99 (available in sizes XS\u20134XL and 27 styles). 8. A short-sleeve pleated dress with the absolute best feature a dress can have \u2014 POCKETS! The wide variety of vibrant prints doesn't hurt, either. Reviewers note that while the fabric is breathable and spring friendly, it's still heavy enough to stay in place so a slip isn't necessary! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love this dress. I bought it in another print after trying it out for a few weeks. It washes and dries perfectly . Good material and pockets!!! I get so many compliments on it, especially the polka-dot one I ordered after this one. They are so versatile, and I wear it all seasons. When it is warmer as is, and in the fall and winter, I layer with it.\" \u2014 Annie Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes S\u20133XL and 28 colors). 9. A gorgeously floaty dress featuring a true wrap design, meaning you can customize it to your perfect fit. It's practically tailor-made for walking around barefoot on the grass. Like any good spring dress, reviewers say this one is super lightweight and never clingy. Amazon Promising review: \"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! I love that it is a wrap dress because you can customize the waist for how you would like it to fit. I was worried about it being too low cut (because I am large in the chest area), but it fits perfectly. I can wear a regular bra and I don't feel like I am showing too much cleavage.\" \u2014 Danielle Palermini Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in sizes XS\u20132XL, two lengths, and five colors available in the calf-length style and 20 available in the ankle-length style). 10. An A-line dress with a wrap waist design that's perfect for any upcoming spring parties... even if that party is just you and your roommate sitting around drinking wine.

I imagine it'd be great for capsule collections. I live with a dog who sheds fur furiously (ha), and I was easily able to shake his fur out of the dress and still go out in public.

Quechua farmer Anacleta Mamani inside her greenhouse in Poques, in Peru\u2019s Cusco region, where she practices agroecological farming as an alternative to face the effects of climate change. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS LAMAY, Peru, Apr 14 2025 (IPS) - \u201cUp here in the highlands, there\u2019s a lot of frost, and everything seems bleak. But I\u2019m so happy since I got my greenhouse and started growing vegetables in a healthy way. I feel like we\u2019re overcoming the challenges of the weather,\u201d Anacleta Mamani, a Quechua farmer from the community of Poques (about an hour\u2019s drive from Cusco, the former imperial capital of Peru), told IPS. Poques is one of 13 farming communities in the municipality of Lamay, located nearly 3,000 meters above sea level in the province of Calca, in the southeastern department of Cusco. Like much of rural Peru\u2019s Andean highlands, the area faces persistent poverty and neglect from the national government\u2014a disadvantage worsened by the climate crisis. This South American country of 34 million people is highly vulnerable to climate change, even though its greenhouse gas emissions account for less than 1 percent of the global total, according to a 2021 measurement by Peru\u2019s Environment Ministry . The ministry, citing figures from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reports that around 5.5 million Peruvians are exposed to floods and another 2.6 million to droughts. Among the most affected are family farmers, as they depend on natural resources\u2014particularly women, due to gender inequalities that limit their ability to respond. \u201cBefore, we only grew potatoes, corn, and quinoa for daily sustenance. Now we also have a variety of vegetables we didn\u2019t even know how to eat before. With the techniques we\u2019ve learned, we\u2019re better equipped to face the climate crisis, which is hitting us hard,\u201d said Mamani, one of 120 families in her community, located in Cusco\u2019s Sacred Valley, known for its landscapes and traditions. She is one of 80 women farmers taking part in a training project led by the non-governmental Flora Trist\u00e1n Peruvian Women\u2019s Center , aimed at developing their farming skills to confront climate change while increasing their participation and decision-making in community organizations. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the first step is working the land\u2014digging up to 60 centimeters deep and loosening the soil so it can breathe. Otherwise, the plants die even if you water them. That\u2019s the first good agroecological practice we\u2019re applying in the greenhouses,\u201d Mamani explained proudly. In four municipalities in Cusco, in the Andean highlands of southeastern Peru, greenhouses aim to enhance the agricultural skills of women engaged in family farming, helping them better cope with the climate crisis. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Agroecology in Daily Life A Quechua speaker born in Poques 59 years ago, Mamani has dedicated her life to farming and family work, never having the chance to attend school. Now, she feels vindicated as she enriches her ancestral knowledge as a student of the Agroecological School run by the Flora Trist\u00e1n Center with support from the Basque Development Cooperation Agency and Mugen Gainetik . \u201cFor a while now, rains, hail, and frost come at the wrong time and cause a lot of damage. Last year, the wind was so strong it flattened the cornfields, and we couldn\u2019t harvest anything\u2014just losses,\u201d she recalled, gesturing with her hands as engineer Janet Nina translated her words into Spanish for IPS. Peru\u2019s National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (Senamhi) reported that 2024 was the hottest year in the last six decades. The consequences included droughts and heavy rainfall, impacting areas like family farming, leading to crop losses and food insecurity. The 80 trained women farmers come from four districts or municipalities: San Salvador, Coya, Calca, and Lamay. Each has a 100-square-meter greenhouse equipped with a drip irrigation system, in which they\u2019ve also been trained for sustainable use. \u201cWe water just enough\u2014no more wasting water. I water my cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes early in the morning before the sun gets too strong, because I have to walk a long way from my house to the greenhouse,\u201d Mamani said. The family of Quechua farmer Anacleta Mamani in Poques, in the Peruvian Andes. Her children Avelina and Ricardo Cruz (second from left and first from right, respectively), along with other family members, have embraced Mamani\u2019s teachings on agroecology to protect the environment and biodiversity threatened by climate change while also improving their daily diet. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS She also grows squash ( Cucurbita pepo ), beets, chard ( Beta vulgaris ), beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), and other vegetables, now a staple in her household diet. The surplus, which is growing, is currently bartered with other families in the community, but starting in May, she will also sell them in nearby markets, providing her with her own income. Through training, she also learned to make natural fertilizers. \u201cI save fruit peels, potato skins, eggshells, and all kitchen scraps, along with ashes from the stove, animal bones, and manure from chickens, sheep, and guinea pigs. We mix it all to make fertilizer that nourishes the soil, producing healthy, strong, and tasty plants,\u201d she shared. She passes this knowledge on to her family\u2014her husband, daughter, son, and their respective families. This dynamic is replicated by other women in the Agroecological School, spreading this climate-resilient farming method. \u201cIn my mom\u2019s greenhouse, there\u2019s a special climate. We can grow many vegetables and eat better. The crops are protected from weather extremes, and we can keep practicing agroecology, caring for our environment, our Pachamama (Mother Earth), and our water for future generations,\u201d said Avelina Cruz, 36, who learns from her mother alongside her husband and teenage daughter. Her husband works in Cusco city and returns on weekends to help apply what they\u2019ve learned. \u201cWe do it carefully because, as my mom says, the plants \u2018speak.\u2019 Protecting nature is our small way of preventing climate change from destroying us,\u201d Cruz said. Diverse vegetable production with an agroecological approach is being developed on the high Andean slopes of communities in southeastern Peru. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Leading the Charge Sociologist Elena Villanueva, the project leader, emphasized the role of Andean rural women in the climate crisis. \u201cThey aren\u2019t responsible for this situation threatening food and water security and human health, yet they don\u2019t hesitate to take action,\u201d she told IPS in Cusco. She highlighted agroecology as a sustainable production model that helps restore ecosystems. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative to industrial, extractive, monoculture-based farming, which worsens global warming and harms the well-being of rural women and families,\u201d she said. She warned that \u201cwe\u2019re at a critical moment where industrialized nations most responsible for climate change are backtracking on emission reduction commitments, ignoring the consequences for vulnerable populations.\u201d She urged national policies to prioritize family farming, which supplies nearly 70% of Peru\u2019s food. \u201cOur authorities must turn their attention to the countryside, promote agroecology, and close gender gaps,\u201d she demanded. In rural areas, women have less access to land, water, seeds, and other resources while bearing heavy workloads that hinder their leadership and political participation. The mayor of Lamay, Glicerio Delgado, criticized the Peruvian government for ignoring rural development demands, including proposals to expand greenhouses and implement water catchment projects as sustainable practices to address climate challenges. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Lack of Support Peru recognizes 55 Indigenous peoples \u201451 from the Amazon and four from the Andes, including the Quechua, the largest group, with nearly five million members nationwide, including rural-to-urban migrants. About 14 percent of Peruvians speak Quechua as their first language. Peru\u2019s 2017 national census was the first to include ethnic self-identification. Andean rural women are mostly Quechua and have inherited ancestral farming knowledge. But migration and shifting community dynamics have left some struggling to adapt to climate challenges. Traditionally, reading nature\u2019s signs guided farming, but this is no longer enough with current erratic weather and rain patterns. Women now face turmoil, which causes constant worry as family farming sustains their households. Lamay\u2019s mayor, Glicerio Delgado, expressed commitment to rural development and climate resilience but lamented the lack of national support. \u201cThere\u2019s much to do\u2014expanding greenhouses, building water catchment systems for family farming led by women. But so far the Ministry of Economy and Finance hasn\u2019t responded to our funding requests,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, in the four Cusco municipalities, Anacleta Mamani and her 79 peers will keep working to sustain their homes with agroecological practices, strengthening their resilience against climate extremes.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Never once had stamina been an issue with this new one. I don't know if I'm misremembering the old dead islands but I was kind of disappointed with this one. This one is too easy for me.

Assuming price is a factor for prospective buyers and you'd want all 3 of these movies, I can't imagine you'll ever get close to this price comparatively for the 4K versions. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Related Searches Entertainment Movies Blu-ray & 4K Blu-ray Free Shipping with Prime Online Only Amazon $55 $70 21% off Levels Grass Fed Whey Protein, 5.64 lbs Double Chocolate or Vanilla Bean $54.99 shipped at Costco.com 6 There is no voting data on this thread You have chosen to downvote this deal.

It\u2019s embarrassing to have guests over because the toilets are so gross! I have tried so many products and cleaning solutions \u2014 from natural essential oils to harsh chemicals so strong I was lightheaded for the rest of the day. Well, I tried out this pumice stone after reading about it in a BuzzFeed article, and honestly the hype is real! It does take some elbow grease, but the after picture is from only 20 minutes of scrubbing, light enough that I didn\u2019t break a sweat! The stone does get used up, but I think this one should last me a couple of years at least. So if you have embarrassing toilets, try this! \" \u2014 Stephanie Ray Get it from Amazon for $9.26 (available in multiple pack sizes). 4.

This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell, and now, after use, we can keep it. Saved me hundreds.

My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back-and-forth movement!

I tried name-brand shower cleaners and bleach to try and clean the soap scum off the tiles and tub. I had no luck and I would cough and get sick because of how strong the smell was. I thought I would try this to save my lungs. I sprayed my entire shower and left it for about 15 minutes. I came back and rinsed off the walls and they were shiny! I've never had such a clean shower. The smell is amazing and subtle. All I smell is tea tree and it didn't affect me at all. The price is also a good deal since the bottle is pretty large.

It won't... so grab this and save the pipes from yourself! www.amazon.com Please note how hard I'm trying not to make a Super Mario Bros. plumbing joke right now. Promising review: \"Y\u2019all, this thing is amazing! My kitchen sink was completely clogged for four days. I\u2019ve been trying to clear the drain with a different sink plunger that I already had and it didn\u2019t do diddly squat. I was about to give up and call a plumber.

I've made so many different rices in it. The only thing I suggest is when making rice that might end up sitting in the pot for a while, put some olive oil on the bottom as the rice tends to stick if it's sitting on the 'warm' setting for too long, or add some extra water. The rice cooker is wonderful though. It's a real time-saver. \" \u2014 Michelle Get it from Amazon for $16.74+ (available in four sizes). 14.

After seeing the results, I couldn't help but spread the word. Sure, it took some beer, a little John Mayer, and a lot of elbow grease, but I got the job done, thanks to this handy little product.

I have a family of four and would frequently have to snake our shower drain, it appears I won't be having that problem ever again. I even give my dog baths and this collects the hair.

I tested the pump to see how well it works, and it worked perfectly! Works just as well as a vacuum, just takes a little more effort pumping out the air. Using these bags, I got half my closet back!

I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it from Amazon for $39.97 . 27.

I think the intuitive, easy to use design is fantastic. We already have the muscle memory for using a spray can. In an emergency, it's so much easier to grab this and use it, and turn a small fire into a non-fire. I don't have time to remember a three step method of fire control when my bacon has gotten out of control on the stove. I'm not a firefighter! I'd really like to have one in every room. Think about it. Isn't it better to immediately contain a small fire than deal with a big one? This could save your life, and your house. \" \u2014 K. Zander Get it from Amazon for $11.99 . 32.

There was a lot of attention to detail put into the design and I particularly appreciate the wire inside the rim that holds everything steady \u2014 no more worrying about spilling all the liquid on the way to the freezer. Just a fantastic product all around. I purchased this and a cheaper version from another manufacturer at the same time but returned the other product. This one is definitely worth the added cost.\" \u2014 Kate Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (available in three colors). 33.

A reviewer in Edge highlighted the arcade releases as having both quantity and quality, and said the Atari 2600 games have held up less well and that the selection of Lynx and Jaguar games were mostly curiosities. I'll pass on this one. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Drifta Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM 92 Posts Joined Nov 2023 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM Drifta Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM 92 Posts Switch version is also $20. All these ROMs are widely available for emulation as well. All you need is something like an Anbernic to emulate these games. Still, the convenience to play them on a modern console is nice. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Slikku Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM 3,830 Posts Joined Apr 2004 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM Slikku Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM 3,830 Posts Last July this collection was on Steam for under $4.

Omnia Studios Ltd. v. JD E-Commerce America Ltd., 2025 WL 961473 (W.D.N.Y. March 31, 2025) This case involves the service Joybuy, which listed items for sale in Walmart.com\u2019s marketplace. The plaintiff alleges that Joybuy sold counterfeit items, as confirmed by test buys. The court is unclear about how Joybuy operates, but it appears that Joybuy (via the entity \u201cJD\u201d) runs its own online marketplace. As a result, the Joybuy listings on Walmart.com are actually third-party merchant listings with Joybuy syndicated to Walmart. This ruling deals with the 512(c) defense. The plaintiff argued that Joybuy/JD did not qualify as a \u201cservice provider\u201d because it was the direct merchant. This is a rare attack on the capacious definition of a service provider, and it did not succeed. The court says that Joybuy sufficiently established that it ran its own online marketplace and thus qualified as a service provider. Shockingly, the plaintiff didn\u2019t contest any of the other 512 elements, so Joybuy defeats the lawsuit. The plaintiff argued that Walmart received direct financial benefits from the listings, so it is disqualified from the 512(c) defense. Rather than address that argument, the court does a switcheroo and says that Walmart doesn\u2019t have the right and ability to control the infringements. This switcheroo doesn\u2019t answer the question on the table, because the 512(c) defense requires the defendant to BOTH not have the requisite supervisory ability AND not have a direct financial interest in the infringements. Showing that Walmart satisfied one 512(c) defense element doesn\u2019t have any bearing on a different defense element. Still ignoring the question on the table, the court explains why Walmart lacked the requisite supervisory ability: Wal-Mart exercised little influence over the activities of its users. As the operator of the marketplace, Wal-Mart allowed users to take the lead on creating listings and thereby selling products\u2014including infringing ones. Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to remove infringing content does not grant it the right and ability to control, nor does its role in screening content as it was listed. The plaintiff also argued that Walmart had red flags of infringement because it was willfully blind. The court says that even if that\u2019s true, Walmart expeditiously removed the infringing items, typically \u201cwithin a day of receiving the complaint.\u201d The court gives Walmart some grace over the exceptions: Plaintiffs point to only a small number of listings that remained active for longer periods of time, but this seems to speak more to the technical difficulties involved in curating an online marketplace than a sign of willful blindness. As reported by Snukset, these lapses are attributable to glitches within Wal-Mart\u2019s automated takedown system\u2014Plaintiffs have not submitted evidence that satisfactorily disputes this. The plaintiffs also challenged Walmart\u2019s implementation of its repeat infringer policy because it didn\u2019t terminate JD. The court accepts Walmart\u2019s explanation: Snukset explains at length why Wal-Mart did not terminate JD or its marketplaces from Walmart.com: because Wal-Mart knew that JD was \u201cnot the actual source\u201d of the infringing products and did not create the listings themselves, that JD had a relatively low number of infringement complaints relative to market volume, and a \u201clack of evidence of prior notice of Plaintiff\u2019s IP rights.\u201d All of these constitute appropriate reasons why an ISP would refrain from terminating a user. Another act of grace from the court. Having a low number of infringement complaints still would sound like a recidivist to most courts. All told, Walmart gets summary judgment on the DMCA online safe harbor defense. I can\u2019t tell why the plaintiff\u2019s narrative fell so flat before this judge, but I don\u2019t know how repeatable this ruling is. The contributory trademark infringement claim against Walmart goes the same. \u201cThe evidence shows that Defendants were on-notice that their marketplaces contained infringing listings\u2014Plaintiff and their agents issued infringement complaints on dozens of such listings. In response to these complaints, however, the evidence shows that Defendants promptly took down nearly all of the infringing listings.\u201d As Miracle Max would say, \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between mostly removed and all removed,\u201d but this court treats them as equivalent. In a footnote, the court says: \u201cWal-Mart points out that Plaintiffs assert \u201crelatively small levels of infringing sales\u2014Chinn ($311.40), Collis ($2,195.28), Omnia ($170.01) and Turkey ($153.66).\u201d Plaintiffs dispute whether these constitute \u201crelatively small levels.\u201d\u201d Say what? This case involved less than $3k of total gross sales??? That seems like dubious grounds to go after a giant business like Walmart. After II Movie, LLC v. WideOpenWest Finance LLC, No. 1:21-cv-01901-DDD-CYC (D. Colo. March 14, 2025) This is a lawsuit against an IAP for subscriber-caused copyright infringement. The contributory copyright infringement claim survives a motion to dismiss when the plaintiffs allege \u201cthat WideOpenWest was notified of over 33,750 specific instances of direct infringement at over 13,000 of its IP addresses, including approximately 100 instances of specific infringements at several IP addresses, yet it did not investigate further or take any action to stop continued infringement by the subscriber accounts associated with those IP addresses.\u201d The IAP argued that Taamneh changed contributory copyright infringement, but that argument was rejected in UMG v. Grande (see also In re Frontier ). With respect to the vicarious copyright infringement claim, the court credits the following allegations: at least one subscriber continued using WideOpenWest\u2019s internet service because WideOpenWest is \u201camazing on torrents\u201d and the subscriber had \u201cnever gotten a letter or notice\u201d despite having \u201cdownloaded truly an outrageous amount of data.\u201d That subscriber recommended WideOpenWest to someone else looking for an internet service provider that is \u201c\u2018less\u2019 strict on downloading.\u201d (Note that nothing in that subscriber\u2019s testimonial refers to copyright infringement. The subscriber could have been celebrating their massive bandwidth consumption, not their massive infringement spree). As a result, the court accepted the inference that \u201ccopyright infringement was a draw for WideOpenWest\u2019s customers, and that WideOpenWest reaped some financial benefit, via attraction or retention of accounts, directly from its users\u2019 downloading and distribution of the plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted works.\u201d As I\u2019ve mentioned many times before, treating IAPs as the deputy copyright sherriffs is bad news for the Internet. For more, see the linkwrap below. Maddry v. Luoxue, 2025 WL 822692 (N.D. Cal. March 14, 2025) The copyrighted work at issue in this case is a card game called \u201cDiscernment,\u201d which contains a deck of \u201cmade up of cards with biblical or funny Christian phrases\u201d that are garbled and need to be decoded. The copyright owner allgedly got flooded with Chinese knockoffs in online marketplaces that undercut his price. He complained to Amazon, which temporarily suspended the listings. Amazon said the listings would be restored unless he sued the knockoff merchants. He sued the online marketplaces pro se and sought an ex parte TRO for various remedies. His requests are all denied. The court says that it cannot bind the online marketplaces because they aren\u2019t defendants and thus are not reachable via FRCP 65. This goes straight to the heart of the SAD Scheme, where rightsowners keep getting TROs that purport to bind the online marketplaces\u2013seemingly lawlessly. The court says that 512(c)(3) takedown notices are supposed to provide the quick relief he seeks, and the court can\u2019t tell if he has availed himself of that procedure. This is a bit unfair to the plaintiff. 512(c)(3) is a way of disqualifying a defendant from the DMCA online safe harbor, but it\u2019s not mandatory that copyright owners send takedown notices to succeed in court. However, as a practical matter, courts have been skeptical when copyright owners sue intermediaries without trying 512(c)(3) notices first, and that appears to be the case again here. The court also says the plaintiff can discover the identity of the merchants through 512(h) subpoenas, so an ex parte TRO is unnecessary. That\u2019s true, but what about disclosures mandated in the INFORM Consumers Act? The court denies the plaintiff\u2019s request to enjoin the merchants from making listings because the complaint doesn\u2019t provide evidence of copyright registrations. An always-embarrassing mistake, even for a copyright owner proceeding pro se. Lopez v. Meta Platforms, Inc., 2025 WL 965811 (S.D.N.Y. March 31, 2025) Lopez claims copyright and trademark ownership of the \u201cNYC New York Cannabis\u201d logo: Lopez claims Meta and its users used the logo to promote the \u201cNYC Canna Cruise.\u201d The problem is that Lopez doesn\u2019t have a copyright registration in the logo because the Copyright Office refused it under its standard policy against registering logos. The unjust enrichment claim fails because it\u2019s preempted by the Copyright Act. The court doesn\u2019t give Lopez another chance to amend in part because \u201cLopez is a serial IP litigant who has filed at least 41 lawsuits in this District against more than 100 different defendants.\u201d Selected Posts About IAP Copyright Liability Internet Access Providers Face Contributory Copyright Liability for Subscribers\u2019 Infringements\u2013UMG v.

April 12, 2025 14:11 ET | Source: Whispeara Whispeara New York City, April 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hearing loss isn\u2019t just an age-related condition\u2014it\u2019s a growing global concern affecting people of all backgrounds and lifestyles. Whether it\u2019s the constant exposure to environmental noise, the long-term effects of earbud usage, or the slow, creeping impact of aging, millions are silently suffering. From asking people to repeat themselves to missing key parts of conversations, the frustration adds up. And for many, the problem isn't just hearing\u2014it\u2019s the emotional toll that comes with it. But there's hope. Whispeara can bring relief and restore the joy of sound. As social situations become more difficult and the feeling of isolation sets in, mental health can begin to deteriorate. Anxiety, fatigue, and even depression can follow when auditory clarity disappears. And while modern solutions like hearing aids promise quick relief, they often fall short of expectations. These devices can amplify sound indiscriminately, fail to address the root cause of the problem, and often come with a hefty price tag. Surgeries and prescription medications present another set of challenges, including high costs, risks, and side effects. That\u2019s why many people are turning to natural solutions\u2014remedies designed to support hearing from the inside out. But the wellness space is crowded, and not all supplements are created equal. Enter Whispeara , a powerful hearing support formula crafted with natural ingredients to help users experience sharper sound, reduced ringing in the ears, and stronger connections between the brain and auditory system. Whispeara stands out because it\u2019s designed to do more than mask symptoms. Its ingredients are strategically chosen to support overall ear health, nourish the auditory nerves, and help fight the inflammation and oxidative stress that contribute to hearing loss. With a growing number of satisfied users, glowing testimonials, and rising popularity, Whispeara is quickly being recognized as one of the best natural alternatives to traditional hearing solutions. Its effectiveness is undeniable, and it's time for you to experience it. In this in-depth review, we\u2019ll explore why hearing loss is becoming so common, what makes Whispeara so effective, how it works inside the body, what real users are saying, and how it compares to similar products on the market. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll have all the information you need to decide whether Whispeara is the right choice to restore clarity, confidence, and quality of life. Why You\u2019re Struggling to Hear \u2013 Understanding the Root Causes Before delving into the functionality of Whispeara, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the intricate nature of hearing loss and tinnitus. These are not simple mechanical issues of 'old ears,' as commonly perceived. The causes are multifaceted, ranging from neurological interference to cellular inflammation. Your ears often bear the brunt of a breakdown in communication between your brain, nerves, and auditory pathways. The Brain-Ear Disconnect One of the most overlooked causes of hearing problems is a breakdown in the brain\u2019s ability to interpret sound signals. Sound isn\u2019t just heard through the ears\u2014it\u2019s processed and understood in the brain. The brain plays a crucial role in not just receiving sound signals, but also in interpreting and making sense of them. Over time, due to aging, oxidative damage, or toxin exposure, this processing system can become sluggish or distorted. This is why many people with age-related hearing loss say they can hear sounds, but can\u2019t understand them. It\u2019s not a problem with loudness\u2014it\u2019s a problem with clarity. Whispeara plays a pivotal role in addressing this critical disconnect. It supports the neurological pathways that carry sound signals from the ear to the brain. By enhancing nerve communication, it has the potential to restore sharper interpretation of sound and improve speech comprehension in noisy environments. This offers hope for those struggling with hearing issues. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Every day, your ears are exposed to oxidative stress caused by free radicals\u2014unstable molecules that damage cells over time. This damage affects the tiny hair cells inside your cochlea that are responsible for detecting sound vibrations. Once these cells are destroyed, they don\u2019t regenerate, making prevention and protection critical. In addition, chronic inflammation in the auditory system can reduce blood flow to the inner ear, choke off nerve endings, and hinder the repair of damaged tissues. Together, oxidative stress and inflammation form the silent villains behind progressive hearing loss. Many of the ingredients in Whispeara are rich in antioxidants and natural anti-inflammatory agents. These work to neutralize free radicals and support circulation to the inner ear, creating a more hospitable environment for sound transmission and nerve health. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors Daily habits can also accelerate hearing decline. Loud environments, constant earbud use, poor nutrition, smoking, unmanaged stress, and even dehydration can all compromise ear health. These factors can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to the auditory system. Add in factors like earwax buildup, past infections, or exposure to toxins, and it becomes clear that hearing loss is rarely due to a single issue\u2014it\u2019s usually the result of a cascade of damaging influences. What\u2019s worse, the onset is often so gradual that many people don\u2019t realize how much they\u2019ve lost until it\u2019s too late. Conversations become harder to follow, high-pitched sounds vanish, and that faint ringing or buzzing sound\u2014tinnitus\u2014starts to become more frequent and persistent. Whispeara was meticulously developed with all these contributing factors in mind. Its comprehensive formula is designed to support the full auditory ecosystem. From cellular repair and nerve protection to circulatory enhancement and brain connectivity, Whispeara is a holistic solution that instills confidence in both prevention and recovery from hearing issues. Don\u2019t Wait\u2014Grab Whispeara Now for Natural Hearing Support What is Whispeara? A Full Breakdown of the Formula and Its Origins Whispeara isn\u2019t just another generic supplement on the market\u2014it\u2019s a precision-formulated natural hearing support formula designed to help restore auditory clarity, reduce tinnitus, and protect long-term ear and brain health. But what exactly is it? And how did it come to stand out in a sea of overpromising products? Let\u2019s dive into the origin of Whispeara, what makes it unique, and why it\u2019s becoming the top choice for people seeking a natural path to sharper hearing. A Solution Born From Frustration According to Whispeara\u2019s official page, the formula was developed in response to a growing problem: millions of individuals suffering from progressive hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and deep frustration with conventional solutions like hearing aids, medications, or surgeries. The creators behind Whispeara recognized that many of the available options on the market failed to address the root causes of auditory decline. Hearing aids merely amplify sound\u2014they don\u2019t repair or protect. Prescription medications often treat symptoms with a laundry list of side effects. And surgical options, while occasionally effective, are both expensive and invasive. Whispeara, in contrast, was formulated to be simple, non-invasive, and accessible to everyone. It was built on the philosophy that restoring hearing requires supporting the full system\u2014ear, brain, and nerve health\u2014not just amplifying external sounds. This approach is designed to provide relief and comfort to those struggling with hearing issues. A Comprehensive, Multi-Stage Approach Whispeara\u2019s standout feature lies in its multi-layered formula. Rather than focusing on just one element of ear health, the supplement takes a holistic view, providing a comprehensive solution that addresses various aspects of hearing health. This is designed to reassure the audience of the thoroughness of the product. Detoxification : Helps cleanse the auditory system from toxins and oxidative stressors that disrupt inner ear and brain communication. Repair and Nourishment : Delivers essential nutrients to rebuild and support the delicate structures of the ear and auditory nerves. Neural Activation : Enhances brain-ear communication by supporting cognitive clarity and neurotransmitter function involved in processing sound. Inflammation Defense : Includes anti-inflammatory agents to reduce swelling and increase circulation in the auditory system. This full-spectrum support is what separates Whispeara from many single-function hearing formulas that may only target tinnitus or ear circulation. Why Whispeara is Gaining Momentum As more people search for effective, affordable, and natural ways to manage their hearing challenges, Whispeara has quickly become one of the most trusted options available. Its rise in popularity isn\u2019t just due to smart marketing\u2014it\u2019s because the product offers a comprehensive alternative to the limitations of traditional hearing interventions. In fact, the product is often referred to as the best natural hearing support formula available in 2025, thanks to its carefully researched blend of ingredients, its non-habit-forming design, and its commitment to long-term hearing wellness. From individuals in their 40s starting to experience early signs of hearing decline, to seniors who are tired of relying on clunky, uncomfortable hearing devices, Whispeara is proving to be a welcome, empowering solution. And as we\u2019ll see in the next section, the formula behind it is more than just impressive\u2014it\u2019s rooted in science. Order Whispeara Today and Start Hearing the World Clearly Again Inside the Formula \u2013 Ingredient Deep Dive At the heart of Whispeara\u2019s success is its carefully chosen blend of natural ingredients, each selected for its unique contribution to auditory health, neurological function, and cellular protection. This isn\u2019t a random cocktail of herbs\u2014it\u2019s a purpose-built formula designed to address hearing loss and tinnitus at the source. This emphasis on purposeful design is intended to instill confidence in the effectiveness of our product. Let\u2019s explore the core ingredients inside Whispeara and the science behind how each one contributes to better hearing, reduced ringing, and long-term ear-brain harmony. The Science of Hearing Support Compounds Unlike standard hearing supplements that rely on just a few generic ingredients, Whispeara combines over a dozen nutrients, antioxidants, and plant extracts. These ingredients work synergistically to protect the auditory nerves, improve blood flow to the inner ear, and reduce inflammation that interferes with sound processing. Key components include: Moomiyo: The Unique Adaptogen for Cellular Vitality Research by Shakirov (2021), Ivanov (2020), and Kolesnikov (2019) has shown that Moomiyo (also known as Shilajit) plays a powerful role as a natural adaptogen with multi-system support capabilities. It enhances immune function, modulates inflammatory responses, and increases physical resilience\u2014all of which are crucial for the maintenance of cochlear health and inner ear function. Within Whispeara, Moomiyo stands out as a foundational antioxidant, uniquely contributing to the detoxification of the auditory system, support for ear canal detox, and reduction of cumulative stress that leads to age-related hearing decline. As a keystone botanical, Moomiyo's deep cellular restoration potential elevates Whispeara above the status quo of ear health supplements. Alpha-GPC: The Cognitive Enhancer for Brain-Ear Synchronization Studies by Kato et al. (2021), Canal et al. (1991), Gatti et al. (2011), and Parker et al. (2015) underscore the impact of Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC) on neurotransmitter support, cognitive clarity, and neuroplasticity. In Whispeara, Alpha-GPC plays a crucial role in the restoration of hearing clarity by optimizing acetylcholine transmission, a key neurotransmitter in the auditory cortex. This nutrient supports both the processing speed of auditory signals and mood regulation, helping to address the mental fog and frustration often linked with tinnitus and hearing loss. Sangiorgi et al. (1994) even noted its promise in managing cognitive decline, placing Whispeara in a class of neuro-hearing protection formulas rather than just a basic supplement. GABA: The Neural Soother for Tinnitus and Auditory Overload Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), supported by Smith et al. (2018) and Lee et al. (2017), is the brain\u2019s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, essential for calming hyperactive nerve signals. In cases of tinnitus and auditory fatigue, dysregulated excitatory activity is common. Whispeara's use of GABA is instrumental in soothing overactive auditory pathways, promoting tranquility in the brain\u2019s hearing centers. This mechanism is a key component of Whispeara\u2019s tinnitus formula, helping to reduce ringing, buzzing, and static noise\u2014a benefit often echoed in real reviews of Whispeara. Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa): Neuromotor and Auditory Enhancement Gupta et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020) highlight L-Dopa extracted from Mucuna Pruriens as a dopaminergic precursor vital for neuroregeneration and motor response. In hearing, dopamine helps modulate synaptic strength in auditory nerve fibers, particularly those that relay sound intensity and pitch. By including L-Dopa, Whispeara reinforces the brain-ear connection, improves response to environmental sound stimuli, and supports neurotransmitter balance. This compound is especially important in addressing age-related hearing decline and supplements that improve auditory signals. L-Arginine: The Vascular Booster for Inner Ear Circulation According to Wu et al. (2016) and Bescos et al. (2012), L-Arginine is a nitric oxide precursor that enhances vascular dilation, thereby improving blood flow to inner ear structures. Good circulation is essential for delivering nutrients and oxygen to the cochlea and surrounding tissues. Whispeara\u2019s use of L-Arginine supports inner ear function, enhances auditory clarity, and contributes to ear health supplements that work by facilitating microvascular repair and nutrient transport\u2014elements that are crucial in hearing improvement through supplements. L-Tyrosine: Resilience Under Cognitive Load L-Tyrosine, as studied by Deijen et al. (2000) and Neri et al. (2015), is a precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine, making it vital for stress resilience and focus under pressure. For individuals with hearing challenges, especially in loud or chaotic environments, the brain\u2019s ability to focus and filter sound is often impaired. By incorporating L-Tyrosine, Whispeara enhances auditory concentration, combats cognitive fatigue, and supports neuro-auditory pathways\u2014making it a key player in the formula\u2019s ability to restore hearing naturally and promote hearing clarity support. Detox, Repair, and Restore Each capsule of Whispeara is designed to perform three key functions, ensuring comprehensive auditory health: Detoxify the auditory system \u2013 clearing buildup and neutralizing toxins that interfere with hearing. Rebuild and nourish \u2013 supporting healthy ear tissue, hair cells, and nerves. Improve neural connections \u2013 enhancing the way your brain interprets sound signals sent from the ear. This is especially important for individuals experiencing high-pitched ringing, buzzing, or static-like noise in the ears. Tinnitus often stems from miscommunication between damaged nerves and the auditory cortex. Whispeara's formula helps soothe this interference by calming inflammation and re-establishing clear nerve pathways. All-Natural, Non-Habit-Forming, and Easy to Use Whispeara stands out from other supplements in its category. It\u2019s not a synthetic compound or a pharmaceutical-grade chemical. Instead, it's a gentle, non-habit-forming, and all-natural solution for auditory health. Every ingredient is included in clinically supported dosages and manufactured in a facility that follows strict quality control practices. Whispeara is not just safe, but also inclusive. It\u2019s vegetarian-friendly, gluten-free, and free from GMOs or artificial additives\u2014making it a safe choice for most individuals looking for an all-natural path to restored hearing. This emphasis on inclusivity is designed to make our potential customers feel catered to and considered in our product design. Say Goodbye to Ringing\u2014Buy Whispeara While Supplies Last How Whispeara Works in the Body Hearing is more than just what your ears pick up\u2014it\u2019s what your brain understands. Whispeara was uniquely formulated not just to enhance the ears, but to restore the entire hearing system, including the neurological connections that interpret sound. This innovative, multi-step internal approach is what sets Whispeara apart from temporary fixes like hearing aids or masking devices, and it's sure to pique your interest. Rather than amplifying noise, Whispeara helps the body work better\u2014clearing pathways, reducing inflammation, and optimizing the transmission of sound from the ears to the brain.Here\u2019s how the process unfolds. The 3-Stage Process of Hearing Restoration Whispeara follows a phased biological process that mirrors the body\u2019s own repair mechanisms. Its ingredients work in unison through the following stages, providing a natural and reassuring path to hearing restoration: Stage 1: Detoxification and Ear Cleansing Whispeara begins by targeting the toxic buildup that often blocks optimal auditory function. Environmental pollutants, heavy metals, synthetic chemicals, and even chronic stress can introduce toxins into the bloodstream. These can interfere with nerve signaling and cause inflammation in the inner ear. Whispeara\u2019s antioxidant-rich ingredients like green tea extract and hawthorn berry go to work clearing this cellular debris, reducing oxidative stress, and refreshing the delicate tissues responsible for sound detection. Stage 2: Repair and Nutritional Rebuilding Once the environment is cleared, the next phase focuses on strengthening the physical structures involved in hearing. This includes the cochlea, auditory nerves, and neuro-auditory pathways. Critical vitamins like B6, B12, and niacin nourish the nerve sheaths and restore signaling potential, while magnesium and zinc support tissue repair and cellular renewal. This rebuilding stage is vital not just for people dealing with gradual hearing loss, but also those suffering from tinnitus\u2014often caused by inflammation or breakdown in the auditory nerve network. Stage 3: Brain-Ear Signal Optimization The final step in Whispeara\u2019s process is to enhance communication between the ears and the brain. Many people with hearing issues report that they \u201chear\u201d but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand.\u201d That\u2019s because the ear captures sound, but the brain deciphers it. When that system is out of sync, confusion, echoing, or muffled hearing can occur. Whispeara supports cognitive clarity through ingredients like ginkgo biloba, which improves blood flow to brain regions responsible for auditory processing. As signal clarity improves, users often report that voices sound sharper, environmental noises are less distorted, and concentration improves\u2014especially in noisy environments like restaurants or group conversations. For instance, users may find it easier to follow conversations in a crowded room or enjoy music without distortion. Long-Term Auditory Health Support This 3-phase cycle isn\u2019t just a short-term fix\u2014it\u2019s designed to build long-term resilience in your auditory system. Regular use of Whispeara can help protect against future decline, support better cognitive function, and preserve the quality of life that comes from clear, confident hearing. This long-term support is sure to give you hope for a better hearing future. Unlike conventional options that focus on one aspect of hearing, such as amplifying sound or reducing tinnitus, Whispeara offers a full-system upgrade: cleansing, rebuilding, and optimizing your body\u2019s natural hearing process\u2014without the need for batteries, invasive procedures, or discomfort. This comprehensive approach sets Whispeara apart from temporary fixes like hearing aids or masking devices, which often provide short-term relief without addressing the underlying issues. Benefits You Can Expect \u2013 From Silence to Clarity Whispeara isn\u2019t just about protecting hearing\u2014it\u2019s about restoring a richer, fuller sensory experience that many people haven\u2019t felt in years. Whether you\u2019re dealing with mild tinnitus, significant hearing decline, or just want to stay ahead of age-related auditory deterioration, Whispeara delivers a broad spectrum of benefits that go far beyond simple sound amplification. Here\u2019s a detailed look at what users can expect\u2014physically, emotionally, and mentally\u2014when taking Whispeara regularly. Immediate and Long-Term Results While every body responds differently, many users report subtle improvements within the first few weeks. This often includes a reduction in the volume or frequency of ringing in the ears, better clarity in everyday conversations, and a noticeable sense of \u201ccalm\u201d in the auditory field. As the detox and repair phases of Whispeara\u2019s process take hold, more profound changes can occur: Improved word recognition \u2013 No more \u201cHuh?\u201d or \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d moments during conversations. Less audio distortion \u2013 Sounds become crisper and easier to isolate, even in noisy environments like restaurants or crowded events. Enhanced sound localization \u2013 You\u2019ll be able to better determine where sounds are coming from, which improves situational awareness. More restful sleep \u2013 Especially for those dealing with constant ringing or buzzing that interrupts rest. Over time, with consistent use, Whispeara may help restore the body\u2019s natural auditory processing abilities, reduce nerve inflammation, and protect against further decline. The goal isn\u2019t just symptom relief\u2014it\u2019s whole-system balance. Tinnitus and Ringing Relief One of the most common reasons people turn to Whispeara is to manage tinnitus\u2014the persistent ringing, buzzing, hissing, or pulsing noise that originates in the ears or brain. Tinnitus isn\u2019t just irritating; it can be mentally exhausting, interfere with sleep, and make everyday life stressful. Whispeara understands this and is here to provide relief. Whispeara approaches tinnitus not as a standalone problem, but as a symptom of underlying inflammation and neurological misfiring. By targeting the root causes through its anti-inflammatory and nerve-calming ingredients like garlic extract, magnesium, and vitamin B complex, many users have reported a significant reduction in their tinnitus volume and frequency. While there is no known \u201ccure\u201d for chronic tinnitus, Whispeara offers a realistic and science-backed path to meaningful relief. Support for Age-Related Hearing Decline Hearing loss due to aging\u2014also known as presbycusis\u2014is a slow, progressive condition that impacts millions. It typically begins with difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds or understanding speech in noisy environments and gradually worsens over time. Whispeara addresses the most common contributors to age-related hearing loss: oxidative stress, blood flow reduction, and nerve signal degradation. With consistent use, the supplement supports better oxygen and nutrient delivery to the ears and brain, helping seniors stay sharp and socially engaged for longer. Instead of waiting for your hearing to deteriorate past the point of no return, Whispeara offers proactive protection and maintenance. It's about taking control of your auditory health and ensuring a better quality of life. Overall Auditory Clarity and Focus It\u2019s not just about hearing sounds\u2014it\u2019s about understanding them clearly. Whispeara improves auditory clarity by supporting both the mechanical and neurological sides of hearing. As blood flow improves and inflammation reduces, your brain processes sound more efficiently, reducing mental fatigue and increasing comprehension. This clarity translates to better focus, stronger memory, and reduced strain in social interactions\u2014something users often describe as \u201cgetting their life back.\u201d Real Stories, Real Relief \u2013 What Users Are Saying While science and formulation are crucial, nothing validates a product like real experiences from everyday people. Whispeara has been gaining a strong reputation through word-of-mouth and verified customer feedback\u2014not just for what it promises, but for what it delivers. People across age groups and backgrounds have shared their personal stories of frustration turned into relief, and silence replaced by clarity. Here\u2019s a closer look at what users are saying about Whispeara, and how this natural supplement has made a real difference in their daily lives. Verified Testimonials from Everyday Users Many individuals turn to Whispeara as a last resort\u2014after trying hearing aids, sound machines, or other supplements that just didn\u2019t help. What they discover instead is often described as surprising, even life-changing, sparking a sense of hope and intrigue in potential users. \u201cI was skeptical at first, but after about three weeks on Whispeara, the buzzing in my ears began to fade.

Hear Every Word Again\u2014Act Fast, Get Whispeara Today Safety, Side Effects & Suitability When choosing any supplement\u2014especially one targeting something as delicate as hearing\u2014safety is a top concern. Whispeara positions itself not only as effective, but also as gentle, natural, and free of the typical side effects seen with pharmaceuticals or invasive procedures. This natural and gentle approach should provide users with a sense of reassurance and peace of mind. So what should users know before getting started? Let\u2019s explore Whispeara\u2019s safety profile, any potential side effects, and who is best suited to take it. Designed for Daily Use Without Dependency Whispeara is formulated with a blend of plant-based extracts, essential vitamins, and minerals \u2014with no synthetic stimulants, artificial chemicals, or habit-forming substances . The product is non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, and manufactured in a facility that adheres to strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards. This attention to purity makes it ideal for long-term use. Unlike hearing aids, which require constant upkeep, or prescription drugs that may lead to side effects or tolerance over time, Whispeara is designed to integrate seamlessly into your daily wellness regimen with minimal risk. Users report that the supplement is easy on the stomach , especially when taken with a meal, and most experience no adverse effects at all \u2014even after extended use. What About Side Effects? While Whispeara is generally very well-tolerated, it\u2019s important to consider that every individual responds differently to supplements. A small number of users may experience mild side effects during the first few days as their body adjusts. These may include: Light digestive discomfort Temporary increase in awareness of ear sensitivity (as circulation improves) Slight headache or fatigue during detox phase These effects are typically short-lived and can often be mitigated by staying hydrated and taking the supplement after meals. If symptoms persist, it\u2019s always wise to consult a healthcare provider. Who Should Use Whispeara? Whispeara is intended for adults experiencing hearing concerns , such as: Gradual or sudden hearing decline Ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments Age-related auditory fatigue Long-term ear health support It\u2019s especially ideal for those who: Want a non-invasive, natural solution Are not ready for or dissatisfied with hearing aids Are seeking a preventative measure for long-term auditory health Who Should Consult a Doctor First? While Whispeara is safe for most adults, there are certain groups who should seek medical guidance before beginning any new supplement: Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions (especially neurological or circulatory) Those currently taking prescription medications , particularly blood thinners or neuroregulators Pregnant or breastfeeding women Anyone under the age of 18 Whispeara is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It should be viewed as a supportive wellness tool , not a substitute for professional medical treatment or hearing care services. Peace of Mind with a Satisfaction Guarantee One of the strongest endorsements of Whispeara\u2019s safety and trustworthiness is the company\u2019s 100% satisfaction guarantee . This guarantee provides users with the peace of mind that they can try the product risk-free for several months, with a full refund available if they\u2019re not satisfied with the results. This customer-first policy speaks to the brand\u2019s confidence in both the safety and performance of its formula, giving users a sense of security and confidence in their purchase. Comparing Whispeara to the Competition The natural supplement market is overflowing with products that claim to support hearing, brain function, or both. Butnot all supplements are created equal. Many are underdosed, poorly formulated, or focused on general wellness rather than the specific causes of hearing decline. Whispeara, however, sets itself apart through its clarity, focus, and performance\u2014and a comparison with other popular formulas makes that crystal clear. A Sharper Focus on Hearing One of the most noticeable differences between Whispeara and alternatives like Quietum Plus, Cortexi, and Synapse XT is its unique focus . While Whispeara was developed specifically for auditory restoration , many competing products take a broader, less defined approach. This distinct focus of Whispeara reassures you that it's designed to address your specific needs. Quietum Plus, for example, includes a variety of herbal ingredients, but its focus is spread across stress management, circulation, and hormonal support\u2014not strictly on ear health. Cortexi markets itself heavily as a cognitive and metabolic enhancer, not a hearing-specific formula. Synapse XT is designed primarily to promote mental clarity and brain function, with minimal direct action on auditory pathways or inner ear support. Whispeara\u2019s mission is different. Every ingredient is included to serve the ear-brain connection \u2014to detoxify the auditory system, reduce inflammation, improve signal clarity, and support nerve repair. This hearing-first philosophy makes it a more targeted and effective option for those struggling with hearing loss or tinnitus. Ingredient Transparency and Quality Another key differentiator is transparency . Whispeara clearly lists its ingredients and their dosages on the product page, so users know exactly what they\u2019re putting into their body. This kind of openness is rare. Many other supplements hide their formulations behind vague \"proprietary blends,\" which means you don\u2019t know how much of each ingredient you're getting\u2014or whether it\u2019s enough to be effective. In contrast, Whispeara\u2019s formulation is backed by clinical research and real-world user outcomes . Each component is selected for its proven benefits, and the dosages align with levels shown in studies to produce results. The inclusion of ingredients like hawthorn berry, garlic extract, B-vitamins, ginkgo biloba, magnesium, and niacin provides support across multiple systems\u2014auditory, neural, vascular, and cognitive\u2014without relying on synthetic fillers, stimulants, or artificial compounds. Customer Experiences Speak Louder Than Labels Beyond formulations, the most compelling evidence comes from the people who\u2019ve actually used the products. Many users report disappointment with competing supplements, saying they either didn\u2019t notice any real changes or felt the results were too subtle to justify the cost. Whispeara\u2019s customers, however, tend to express satisfaction with their noticeable results \u2014often within the first few weeks. Tinnitus relief, improved conversation clarity, and a greater sense of peace and mental sharpness are among the most commonly shared outcomes. This high level of user satisfaction should give you confidence in Whispeara's effectiveness. The fact that many Whispeara users go on to reorder and recommend the product is another major advantage\u2014it\u2019s not just being bought, it\u2019s being trusted. Value for Your Investment When comparing cost, most hearing supplements land in a similar price range. But Whispeara stands out for what you\u2019re actually receiving. Not only is the formula more targeted and potent, but it also comes with a generous money-back guarantee that gives users plenty of time to try it risk-free. This value for money makes Whispeara a wise investment in your health. For those looking to stock up, multi-bottle bundles bring the price down considerably, and the brand offers periodic discounts that make it one of the more accessible premium formulas available. Why Whispeara Wins To put it simply, Whispeara is designed specifically for people who want to support, restore, and protect their hearing \u2014not just boost brain power or overall wellness. Its focus, transparency, positive user outcomes, and strong refund policy make it the clear leader in the natural hearing support space. If you\u2019ve tried other supplements and walked away disappointed, Whispeara could be the one that actually delivers. How to Use Whispeara for Best Results One of the most comforting aspects of Whispeara is its simplicity in becoming a part of your daily routine. There are no complex programs, no messy drops, no external devices to manage\u2014just two capsules a day. But like any supplement, consistency and proper usage are key to experiencing its full range of benefits. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to get the most out of Whispeara. Simple, Effective Dosage The recommended dosage for Whispeara is two capsules per day , preferably taken with a meal and a glass of water. This ensures proper absorption of fat-soluble nutrients and reduces the chance of mild stomach discomfort, which can sometimes occur when taking any supplement on an empty stomach. Some users prefer taking both capsules in the morning for an early mental and auditory boost, while others split the dose\u2014one with breakfast and one with dinner\u2014for sustained support throughout the day. Either method is effective, so it\u2019s more about what fits your lifestyle best. When Will You Start to Notice Results? While some people report subtle changes within the first few days\u2014such as a decrease in tinnitus intensity or feeling more \u201cpresent\u201d in conversations\u2014 Whispeara is not a quick fix . It\u2019s a formula designed to repair, restore, and protect hearing over time. For most users, noticeable improvements begin around the 2- to 4-week mark , especially when it comes to clarity, ringing reduction, and ear sensitivity. The detoxification and repair stages typically take place in the first month. Continued use for 60 to 90 days tends to deliver deeper, more long-lasting changes in auditory health and overall cognitive performance. That\u2019s why the company recommends purchasing a multi-month supply, particularly for those with moderate to severe hearing concerns. Tips for Maximizing Your Results To get the most out of your Whispeara experience, here are a few best practices to follow: Take it consistently \u2013 Missing doses can delay your progress. Try setting a reminder if needed. Stay hydrated \u2013 Water helps the body flush out toxins and supports circulation to the ears and brain. Pair with healthy habits \u2013 Reduce exposure to loud environments, use ear protection when necessary, and avoid excessive use of earbuds or headphones. Get enough sleep \u2013 Proper rest supports neurological repair and recovery, which enhances the effects of hearing support supplements. Be patient \u2013 Natural restoration takes time. Whispeara is working behind the scenes to recalibrate your body, reduce inflammation, and optimize neural pathways. Can You Stack It With Other Supplements? Yes. Whispeara is generally safe to take alongside other wellness supplements such as multivitamins, omega-3s, or memory-support formulas. This safety aspect is designed to reassure you. However, if you\u2019re using medications\u2014especially those that affect blood flow, neurological health, or inflammation\u2014it\u2019s wise to consult your healthcare provider just to be sure there are no interactions. What\u2019s important is that Whispeara doesn\u2019t rely on stimulants or sedatives, making it safe for both daytime and evening use, without the risk of jitters, crashes, or dependency. In summary, Whispeara was designed to be as convenient as it is effective. Just two capsules a day may be all it takes to start hearing better, thinking more clearly, and finally feeling like yourself again. This convenience is meant to put you at ease and make the process more comfortable.

Now, with Epomaker's Magforce 68, the company has been able to integrate compactness, design, and quality all in a single package, and this particular keyboard is what I would call one of the best options out there if you are looking for something \"small.\" Epomaker Magforce 68 - Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro Switches, Hall Effect Technology & Speedy Type-C Connection Well, in the keyboards segment, there are really many 65% layout options that are said to be something a hardcore gamer would prefer, and Epomaker probably had these in mine before designing the Magforce 68. For someone like me whose work performance revolves around having a decent keyboard, my experience with this keyboard has been a charm. While the \"compactness\" hasn't appealed to me much, the typing quality is simply something that I am sure every purchaser will appreciate. Related Story Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives Thinks Trump Has Taken \u201cThe Doomsday Scenario Off The Table\u201d And Tech Stocks Will Rally Come Monday, But One Options Market Veteran Feels \u201cIt\u2019s A Crowded Trade\u201d For a quick rundown of Epomaker Magforce 68 specifications, it features the Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro switches, which we'll discuss extensively ahead of time, along with a CNC aluminum body and much more. Here's a summary of the keyboard's features/specifications: Specification Details Brand EPOMAKER Model Magforce 68 Layout 65% ANSI US Layout Number of Keys 68 keys Connectivity Type-C Wired Compatibility WIN Case Material Aluminum Finish Anodized Flex-Cut No Flex-Cut Mounting Structure Top-Mount Plate Material FR4 PCB Thickness 1.6mm Stabilizers Plate-Mount Stabilizer Typing Angle 7 degree Sound Dampening Poron Sandwich Foam, Bottom Foam, Bottom EVA Keycaps Profile Cherry Profile Keycaps Material PBT Plastic Keycaps Manufacturing Technique Double-Shot RGB South-facing, per-key RGB Polling Rate 8000Hz Scan Rate 32kHz per key Latency 0.125ms (USB) Anti-Ghosting N-Key Rollover Keyboard Dimensions 314.5 * 113.9 * 38.6 mm Keyboard Weight 1.5kg Package Weight About 2kg Epomaker Magforce 68 - Unboxing & Close-Up The packaging of the keyboard is undoubtedly creative, as the box features a black and blue-themed design, with the branding at the very front. When you open up the box, there's cushioning on both the top and the bottom, which means that the company has ensured that the unit doesn't get damaged when shipping it across different regions. Inside the box, you get the standard manual, a Type-C USB cable, and a keycap puller, which is pretty standard for every keyboard. You also get extra Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro switches in case a replacement is needed, which might come in handy. When I saw the keyboard for the first time, I started to think about the unit's compactness, since I could almost carry its weight entirely at the palm of my hands. That is indeed the beauty of a 65% layout, since not only does it make portability much easier, but it occupies a little space on your desk, which means that you can use the extra space left for something else. But, you do get void of elements such as a dedicated numpad, so it is more of a consumer choice in the end. Starting with the keycaps come in a cherry profile design, which is the common notion in the segment. They are made out of PBT Plastic, which not only is a sturdy material but also ensures that there are no thumbprint impressions on the keycaps after extensive use, and I did notice this after using the keyboard for several days. Another interesting factor about the Magforce 68 is its sound-dampening mechanism, which uses Poron Sandwich Foam as the main cushion, creating that \"crisp\" typing sound. Epomaker Magforce 68 - Design Language, Hall Effect Technology & Gateron Magnetic Switches One thing about the keyboard that makes it a bit weird is the design language. The overall vibe of the product is seen as something \"minimalistic\" and more professional-oriented, but switching on the RGB makes the design layout complicated. Apart from this, the RGB really strikes out when you look at it for the very first time, and a more \"diffused\" look would have been a better choice, like the Galaxy100 counterpart. One of the standout features of the Magforce 68 is the \"Hall Effect\" technology, which uses a magnetic field to detect keystrokes, providing a smoother and quieter experience. Here's how Epomaker describes it: This feature allows users to fine-tune the actuation distance, catering to specific gaming or typing preferences. The Snap Tap function ensures rapid keystroke registration, while the Dead Zone adjustment eliminates unintended inputs, providing unparalleled control. This level of customization, powered by magnetic switches, ensures that every keystroke is accurate and consistent, enhancing performance across various use cases. So, consumers of different segments could easily fine-tune the actuation distance to get the desired typing experience, which really opens up the Magforce 68 to several types of users. You can utilize Epomaker's cloud adjustment platform to fine-tune the keyboard's performance. Speaking of the onboard switches, the Epomaker Magforce 68 comes with the widely-known Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro, a magnetic linear switch popular for their \"cracky\" sound, similar to Mahjong tiles clicking together. They come with a travel distance of 3.5mm with a lifespan of over 100 million keystrokes. These switches are primarily used in keyboards supporting the Hall Effect technology and are widely used by a variety of keyboard integrators. Since switches are a personal preference, I won't comment much on them, apart from the fact that if you don't like a \"cracky-sounded\" keyboard, the Magforce 68 isn't for you. Epomaker Magforce 68 Conclusion - Ideal Option If Compact & High-Performing Keyboard Is Your Need This particular keyboard is one of the best options in a 65% layout segment, but it comes with a hefty price tag of $159.99, which might seem justified if you look at the specifications alone. If you are eager to purchase the Epomaker Magforce 68, you can refer to the company's official website here and enjoy a great experience. 8.5 WCCFTECH RATING The Epomaker Magforce 68 is a great option for consumers looking for a compact keyboard option that features a great typing experience. Combined with the Hall Effect technology, the Magforce 68 is suited for many consumers out there.

It has (mostly) been all I have needed. Now that 10 support is ending, I was thinking of what I may use next, but really don't want have to go through the Windows installation which I found a nightmare! I am looking at this can anyone offer advice/opinions? The Amazon description seems rather lacking especially in the O.S. area and I wouldn't want to end up with having to buy and install my own copy of Windows! \ud83d\ude44 Thanks.

Back to top #4 six-h six-h Topic Starter Members 450 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: North West England Local time: 07:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 01:31 PM @Cat Herder I agree, they are brilliant. I have been an Intel fan for many years but have a sneaky feeling that AMD currently give better bang for the bucks. Since my desire is to gain entry to the W11 party without the graft of installation, the lack of detail on the proffered OS is a deal breaker. Just wondering if there are any Beelink aficionado's here who can clarify just what we would likely receive, seems from the responses on the \"hotukdeals site\" even the dratted model is also now in dispute!! Back to top #5 six-h six-h Topic Starter Members 450 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: North West England Local time: 07:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 01:34 PM Thanks @PhillPower2, so that's a \"No\"! Back to top #6 ranchhand_ ranchhand_ Members 5,719 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: Midwest Local time: 12:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 02:09 PM You asked for an evaluation, but have not detailed exactly you want to use this for, so this cripples any responses. The specs are good, and the Ryzen9 CPU is a top-contender. I have built 2 desktops using the Ryzen7 and 32 gigs RAM and they jet through programs on Windows 11. I am about ready to start a new build using the Ryzen7, that's how much I like AMD. If you are going to use it only for streaming videos, watching movies and surfing the internet to shopping sites, etc. the specs are fine. Note what it is intended for with the amount of RAM that is devoted to graphical interface, about half of the 32gigs. So...if you run heavy duty programs such as video editing & creation, this is going to slow down a lot. I am a bit careful because Amazon lists only 15 ratings, and out of those only 5 users actually posted in with reviews. They claim as follows: \" 89% positive ratings from 200+ customers \" but I don't see those Amazon ratings. They claim this is a gaming machine. I seriously doubt that, unless childrens', low-overhead games that I am sure you would not be interested in are played. They claim this will run Photoshop. Well, ok, maybe only if it comes with Windows11 (not spec'd) and it will run very slow-w-w-w-w. What I don't like is that it appears not to come with an OS, or with one unspecified. Possibly using Linux? That's a deal-breaker for me. Here in the USA Amazon gives a 30-day return period for almost any reason, postage paid. If you have that in the UK then you are pretty safe. Really work the bejabbers out of it immediately to have it prove itself. Honestly, I would pass on it. Edited by ranchhand_, Yesterday, 02:12 PM.

You have more or less summed up my intended usage, but I do do quite a lot of Photo manipulation with Elements 2019 and some Video work using Shotcut which my current Intel i5 based NUC manages reasonably quickly though I suspect My demands are few since it achieves all I require with only 8GB of DDR4 ! The total confusion around this Amazon offer leads me to believe that it will not be the specification we think it will be. Returning may also be disappointing since we pay the import duty and tax up front and I suspect that may not be refundable. Think I'll wait for something a little less nebulous!

I take your point and also the advice of @PhillPower2 and will \"step away\" from that deal! I think I'll wait and see if there are any good deals during the year. Having always had Intel based machines before, I fancy AMD Ryzen are perhaps better value/faster these days. I've lived with this NUCi5SYH machine with 8GB DDR4 which has been capable of satisfying most of my needs despite having the OS Trashed by Microsoft's engineers who Naused up their attempt to create \"Libraries\" for me and I ended up with two folders with exactly the same content, ...everything that was on the dratted machine! So traumatised was I from doing the original install, I couldn't face doing it again to correct their mistake. That's why I really need my next machine to have W11 preinstalled. Hopefully something will come along before W10 expires that will fit my fairly conservative needs.

Golden rule when asking for help with a new rig ( or even upgrading ) is to state your intended use and when possible your maximum budget, if we know your intended use we can do some research for you. Being honest I am a bit taken aback about your almost fear of installing Windows, it is far easier nowadays and especially when you think back to the days when you had to slipstream SATA drivers into Windows XP.

Introduction In an age where physical performance, mental clarity, and intimate vitality are becoming critical to men's overall health, the market for male enhancement supplements continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Whether it's due to age-related decline, chronic stress, or sedentary lifestyles, many men today face issues related to low stamina, diminished drive, and fluctuating testosterone levels. This surge in demand has led to an influx of quick-fix solutions and synthetic alternatives\u2014many of which underdeliver or include hidden subscriptions and questionable ingredients.

With a clean formulation, no hidden auto-shipments, and a 180-day money-back guarantee, Alpha Bites is rapidly earning its place as a trusted name in men's health.

It will also explore the specific pain points men face, how this supplement addresses them, and why it has become a standout performer among male enhancement supplements on the market today. Whether you're seeking improved energy, enhanced intimacy, or just a natural edge in your day-to-day performance, this article delivers everything you need to know\u2014accurately, thoroughly, and without the hype. If you're ready to take the next step towards improving your health and vitality, consider giving Alpha Bites a try. II. Understanding the Root of Male Performance Decline Declining male performance is a topic that is often met with silence, yet it impacts millions of men across age groups and lifestyles. The signs may begin subtly: lower energy levels, reduced interest in intimacy, difficulty maintaining stamina during physical or mental tasks, or even a loss of self-confidence. Over time, these issues can become persistent and disruptive, affecting not only personal health but also relationships, work performance, and emotional well-being. The Biological Causes of Performance Decline One of the most common causes of diminished male vitality is the natural decline in testosterone levels that begins as early as the late 20s or early 30s. Testosterone plays a central role in regulating muscle mass, bone density, libido, mood, and energy. As levels drop over time, men may experience a wide array of unwanted symptoms, including fatigue, mood swings, decreased libido, and even reduced cognitive sharpness. Additionally, poor blood flow\u2014a key factor in physical and sexual performance\u2014is often linked to sedentary habits, poor nutrition, and oxidative stress. As circulation worsens, the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to critical areas, including the brain and reproductive organs, is compromised. This leads to reduced performance and delayed recovery. Lifestyle and Psychological Factors Performance is not purely physical; it is tightly connected to mental resilience and emotional health. Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, and poor dietary choices create a vicious cycle that further depletes energy reserves and hormonal balance. Anxiety and low self-esteem also feed into the problem, often worsening physical symptoms through psychosomatic responses. Furthermore, many men are unaware that nutritional deficiencies\u2014especially in key compounds like nitric oxide precursors, adaptogenic herbs, and essential vitamins\u2014contribute to poor stamina and drive. The modern diet is often stripped of these performance-supporting nutrients, leaving many to rely on stimulants or ineffective over-the-counter options that do little more than mask symptoms. Why Most Solutions Fall Short The supplement industry is flooded with fast-acting pills and synthetic stimulants that promise instant results but often come with undesirable trade-offs\u2014crashes, side effects, and even hidden subscriptions that trap consumers into recurring charges. Many of these products are underdosed, loaded with filler ingredients, or built on unproven formulas lacking clinical research. What men need is not just a short-term fix but a strategic, natural solution that supports their body's systems holistically\u2014from hormones and circulation to stress resilience and cellular energy. This is where Alpha Bites steps in. In the next section, we'll examine why Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies have rapidly become a trusted product in the male health space, offering a complete and clinically grounded formula that targets the root causes of decline rather than merely covering up symptoms.

This section provides an in-depth examination of the core ingredients used in Alpha Bites, based on the official formulation listed on getalphabites.com , and explains how they work together to deliver measurable benefits. Each ingredient has been chosen based on its relevance to nitric oxide production, testosterone support, cognitive resilience, and overall male wellness. Let's take a closer look: 1. Catuaba Bark Extract (200 mg) Known in traditional Brazilian medicine for centuries, Catuaba bark is a natural aphrodisiac celebrated for its libido-enhancing effects.

Beet Root Powder (200 mg) Beets are a rich source of dietary nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide in the body\u2014a compound that supports vascular dilation and improved blood flow.

Benefit to users : Increases energy, libido, and stress resilience. Scientific connection : Clinical trials show improvements in mood, desire, and physical performance 4. Horny Goat Weed Extract (250 mg) Also known as Epimedium, this botanical contains icariin, a natural compound known for its phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitory activity.

Visit the official website: getalphabites.com Synergistic Effects and Formula Cohesion Unlike many products that stack ingredients haphazardly, Alpha Bites relies on intentional synergy.

Vitamin C ties the formula together by promoting cellular health and metabolic balance. There are no proprietary blends, which means users know precisely what they are consuming. This level of transparency is rare in the supplement space and underscores Alpha Bites' commitment to consumer trust. In the next section, we'll examine how these ingredients interact within the body and explore the science behind their combined effects on performance, vitality, and long-term health. V. How Alpha Bites Works: The Science Behind the Formula Understanding how Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies deliver results requires examining the interplay of hormonal regulation, circulatory function, and cellular resilience. Each ingredient in the formula plays a distinct role, but the power of Alpha Bites lies in how these components work together to support the male body holistically. 1. Enhancing Circulation Through Nitric Oxide Pathways At the core of male physical and sexual performance is healthy blood flow. Without adequate circulation, achieving and sustaining performance\u2014whether in the gym or the bedroom\u2014becomes increasingly complex. Alpha Bites leverages Beet Root Powder and Horny Goat Weed, both of which contribute to nitric oxide production and vascular dilation. Beet Root Powder provides a natural source of nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. This allows blood vessels to relax and expand, enhancing oxygen delivery to muscle tissue and intimate areas. Horny Goat Weed supports nitric oxide bioavailability while also acting as a PDE5 inhibitor, which can help maintain stronger, longer-lasting erections without pharmaceutical interference. By improving vascular tone and blood delivery, Alpha Bites helps optimize both physical endurance and intimate performance. 2. Supporting Natural Testosterone Levels Testosterone is a key hormone for male vitality, and Alpha Bites incorporates a three-pronged approach to supporting it naturally: Tribulus Terrestris supports testosterone synthesis and helps enhance the body's natural androgen response. Maca Extract is an adaptogen that indirectly supports hormonal balance by improving stress responses and overall endocrine function. Horny Goat Weed contains icariin, which has been shown in some studies to support testosterone signaling. While Alpha Bites does not contain synthetic testosterone or DHEA, it supports the body's own production and regulatory pathways, promoting balance rather than artificial spikes. 3. Addressing Stress and Mental Fatigue Performance is not just physical\u2014it is deeply tied to mental stamina, mood, and emotional resilience. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, which can interfere with testosterone and lead to symptoms like fatigue, reduced libido, and poor concentration. Maca Extract acts as a natural adaptogen to regulate stress and improve energy levels. Vitamin C helps lower oxidative stress and cortisol levels, contributing to a more stable mood and faster physical recovery. By targeting these underlying factors, Alpha Bites provides more than a temporary lift\u2014it helps rebuild a more balanced and energetic foundation for daily life. 4. Enhancing Libido and Sexual Desire Ingredients like Catuaba Bark and Maca have long-standing reputations in herbal medicine for their effects on sexual desire and arousal. These botanicals stimulate neurotransmitter activity and may help increase the frequency of spontaneous arousal and overall intimacy satisfaction. This effect is often enhanced by the circulatory benefits of Beet Root and Horny Goat Weed, which improve physical readiness during moments of intimacy. 5. Fast Absorption, Consistent Support Because Alpha Bites is delivered in gummy form, the active ingredients are absorbed more efficiently through the digestive tract compared to hard-pressed pills or tablets. This means faster action and better consistency in results over time. Used daily, Alpha Bites becomes a cumulative performance enhancer, supporting long-term energy, hormone health, stamina, and confidence\u2014without resorting to synthetic additives or crash-inducing stimulants. In the next section, we'll break down the specific, real-world benefits men are reporting from Alpha Bites, from energy and mood to libido and relationship satisfaction\u2014offering further insights into why this product stands out in the male enhancement supplement market. Don\u2019t Settle for Less\u2014Upgrade Your Stamina, Drive, and Confidence with Alpha Bites VI. The Benefits of Alpha Bites: What Users Can Expect While Alpha Bites is built on a foundation of natural ingredients and scientific theory, its actual value lies in the real, measurable benefits users experience when taken consistently. By addressing key biological, hormonal, and psychological factors affecting male vitality, Alpha Bites positions itself not only as a performance enhancer but also as a comprehensive male wellness support tool. Here's what men can realistically expect from incorporating Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies into their daily routine: 1. Increased Energy and Stamina The combination of Maca Root, Vitamin C, and Beet Root Powder supports mitochondrial energy production and improved blood circulation, which directly translates into increased physical stamina and reduced fatigue. Men report more energy throughout the day without relying on caffeine or stimulants. Physical endurance, particularly in exercise or athletic contexts, improves due to better oxygen delivery and muscular recovery. 2. Enhanced Libido and Sexual Drive Loss of desire can be one of the most demoralizing experiences for men, especially when it happens gradually. Alpha Bites helps restore sexual interest, responsiveness, and spontaneous desire by boosting both mental and physical readiness. Catuaba Bark and Maca Extract stimulate neurotransmitter activity linked to arousal. Improved blood flow heightens sensitivity and physical responsiveness. 3. Improved Erection Quality and Performance Thanks to the nitric oxide-boosting effects of Horny Goat Weed and Beet Root, many users notice improvements in erection firmness, duration, and frequency\u2014without the use of synthetic chemicals. Better circulation ensures that tissues receive adequate blood flow for optimal function. Men report increased confidence and reduced performance anxiety. 4. Hormonal Support and Testosterone Balance With ingredients like Tribulus Terrestris and Horny Goat Weed, Alpha Bites supports testosterone activity, helping men regain their natural hormonal edge. Benefits include improved muscle tone, greater physical resilience, and enhanced mood. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, Alpha Bites works with the body's systems. 5. Stress Relief and Mood Stability Men often overlook the role that stress and mental fatigue play in diminishing performance. Alpha Bites supports emotional wellness through ingredients that stabilize cortisol and support the nervous system. Maca's adaptogenic properties help improve focus and mood under pressure. Vitamin C reduces oxidative stress and inflammation that may contribute to fatigue and mood swings. 6. Confidence, Motivation, and Quality of Life Perhaps the most overlooked but vital benefit of Alpha Bites is the restoration of confidence . As energy returns, drive improves, and relationships strengthen, men report feeling like themselves again\u2014often even better. Improved vitality contributes to greater motivation and productivity. Enhanced performance leads to more satisfying personal and professional relationships. The cumulative effect of Alpha Bites is a total upgrade in the male experience\u2014from the gym to the bedroom and from the boardroom to day-to-day interactions. These aren't short-term bursts of energy but long-lasting improvements rooted in better biological balance and nourishment.

These mental health benefits are subtle but powerful contributors to overall performance. \"I feel more in control of my stress, and my focus has improved. This wasn't just about performance\u2014it's made a difference in my daily mindset.\" \u2013 Mike T., Verified Customer, Age 50 No Side Effects, No Gimmicks Unlike many male enhancement products that are plagued by negative feedback due to hidden subscriptions, synthetic stimulants, or unwanted side effects, Alpha Bites is consistently praised for its clean formulation and transparent business model. \"No weird side effects. No surprises on my credit card. Just a solid supplement that works when you use it daily.\" \u2013 Brian C., Verified Customer, Age 45 Testimonials as Social Proof The volume and consistency of positive reviews for Alpha Bites act as compelling social proof, reinforcing its positioning as one of the top-rated male enhancement gummies in 2025. The results are not exaggerated promises of overnight success but relatively steady, compounding improvements in performance, confidence, and well-being. In the next section, we'll examine how to use Alpha Bites effectively to achieve optimal results and provide tips for incorporating it into a holistic male health routine. VIII. How to Use Alpha Bites for Maximum Results While the formulation behind Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies is supported by science and user reviews, achieving optimal benefits depends on one crucial factor: consistency. Like any natural supplement, Alpha Bites is not intended to produce instant, pharmaceutical-like effects. Instead, it supports the body's internal systems over time, creating sustainable improvements in energy, hormonal balance, and performance. This section explains how to use Alpha Bites properly, what to expect at each stage of supplementation, and how to integrate the gummies into a broader lifestyle strategy for male health. Recommended Daily Dosage According to the manufacturer, the ideal usage protocol is: Take two Alpha Bites gummies once per day , preferably with food and water. Choose a consistent time of day (morning or early afternoon) to establish a routine. Do not exceed the suggested dosage, as the formulation has been calibrated for optimal efficacy at the recommended level. Short-Term vs Long-Term Results Alpha Bites is designed to support male health in both immediate and gradual ways: Within the first 1\u20132 weeks , many users report increased energy, mental clarity, and a noticeable uplift in stamina. By weeks 3\u20136 , improvements in mood, confidence, and libido tend to become more apparent. After 2\u20133 months , the effects may become more stable and profound\u2014particularly in hormonal balance, circulatory health, and overall vitality. For men over 40 or those with chronic fatigue or low testosterone symptoms, extended use (3\u20136 months) is encouraged to allow the adaptogenic and circulatory benefits to take full effect. Lifestyle Factors That Enhance Results To get the most from Alpha Bites, users are advised to complement supplementation with basic lifestyle principles: Stay hydrated : Water enhances nutrient absorption and supports circulation. Get adequate sleep : Hormonal restoration primarily occurs during deep sleep cycles. Exercise regularly : Even moderate physical activity supports blood flow, nitric oxide production, and testosterone regulation. Manage stress : Pairing Alpha Bites with mindfulness techniques or stress-reducing practices may enhance the product's adaptogenic effects. These habits don't accelerate results, help sustain long-term improvements, and maximize the supplement's return on investment. Warnings and Precautions While Alpha Bites is made from natural, non-GMO ingredients and is manufactured in FDA-registered facilities under GMP guidelines, users should be aware of the following: Do not use if under 18 years old . Consult a healthcare professional before starting if you have known medical conditions, are taking prescription medications, or are being treated for hormonal imbalances or cardiovascular issues. Avoid combining Alpha Bites with other testosterone boosters or nitric oxide supplements without medical guidance. In the next section, we'll evaluate Alpha Bites's performance compared to other leading male enhancement gummies on the market, analyzing differences in ingredients, results, and trustworthiness to demonstrate why Alpha Bites stands out in 2025. IX. Alpha Bites vs Other Male Enhancement Gummies The market for male enhancement products is highly competitive, and with dozens of brands promising everything from enhanced libido to instant performance, it's crucial to distinguish hype from substance. In this section, we compare Alpha Bites with other popular male enhancement gummies and supplements available in 2025, such as Boostaro, Red Boost, Erecta Gummies, and various private-label formulas found on eCommerce marketplaces. By examining ingredients, transparency, safety, pricing, and customer satisfaction , Alpha Bites emerges as a category leader designed with consumer trust and holistic male wellness in mind. 1. Ingredient Transparency and Dosage Integrity Many male enhancement products use proprietary blends\u2014meaning the ingredients are listed, but their exact dosages are hidden. This often results in underdosing, where key compounds like Maca or Tribulus are included in ineffective quantities for marketing purposes only. Alpha Bites: Fully discloses each active ingredient and its dosage . Avoids proprietary blends entirely. Includes clinically supported dosages of Beet Root, Maca, Horny Goat Weed, Tribulus Terrestris, Catuaba Bark, and Vitamin C. Competitors: Often rely on \"proprietary performance blends.\" Include filler ingredients or low concentrations of premium botanicals. May exaggerate benefits without scientific grounding. 2. Natural Formulation vs Synthetic Enhancers Alpha Bites: 100% plant-based , non-GMO, and free from synthetic hormones or chemicals. Designed to work with the body's hormonal and circulatory systems , not override them. Competitors: Some contain synthetic stimulants or harsh aphrodisiacs , increasing the risk of side effects. May rely on temporary vasodilators that lead to \"crashes\" or cardiovascular strain. 3. Performance vs Gimmicks Alpha Bites: Focuses on sustainable performance , not just a one-time boost. Designed for daily use to improve energy, stamina, and hormone balance over time. Competitors: Often marketed as \"fast-acting\" or \"instant results,\" it appeals to impulse buyers but lacks longevity. Formulas may not support long-term vitality, energy, or testosterone levels. 4. Purchasing Model and Guarantee Alpha Bites: Sold direct-to-consumer only from the official website ( getalphabites.com ). No hidden subscriptions or auto-shipments . Backed by a 180-day money-back guarantee \u2014far exceeding industry norms. Competitors: Many products offer 14- or 30-day return windows , with restocking fees. Auto-renew traps are typical\u2014some customers unknowingly subscribe to monthly billing. 5. User Trust and Reputation Alpha Bites: Highly rated for honest advertising , transparent formulation, and real results. Developed in the United States in GMP-certified, FDA-registered facilities . Earns trust through hundreds of verified positive testimonials. Competitors: Many brands have limited background transparency. Negative reviews often highlight billing disputes, side effects, or lack of results . Conclusion of Comparison When measured across core performance metrics, safety, pricing fairness, and long-term user experience, Alpha Bites consistently outperforms much of the competition. Its formula is not only clinically thoughtful but also ethically marketed, making it an ideal solution for men looking for real, sustainable results without compromises.

Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream formulated with salicylic acid to exfoliate your skin (without being too rough), and hyaluronic acid to help it retain moisture. This can help your d\u00e9colletage area to appear smoother and firmer \u2014 in fact, multiple reviewers have noticed a difference in a matter of *pause for dramatic effect* DAYS. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"My dry neck and the annoying itchiness I used to experience have completely gone away after using this cream. It\u2019s not only soothing, but it also feels like it\u2019s really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It\u2019s become a must-have in my skincare routine.\" \u2014 JAcosta Get it from Amazon for $11.89 (also available in a two-pack). 2. A Bissell multipurpose carpet and upholstery cleaner reviewers absolutely love for removing stains and messes from carpets, furniture, and car interiors. Don't let the fact that it's small and portable fool you; this little green cleaning machine has a pow-er-ful suction! So if you've been ignoring those salt and mud stains all over the floor of your car, it's about time you clicked \"add to cart.\" www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I was super skeptical. My dog was not feeling well and started relieving himself on our bedroom rug. I had tried multiple spray cleaners and techniques but couldn\u2019t get the smell out. I was convinced I\u2019d need to get rid of my rug, and this was my last shot. I honestly thought I\u2019d have to return it. Nope!! Easy to assemble. Easy to use and clean. I used it with the pet cleaning solution. My rug is clean and odor free!!! I\u2019m excited to use this on my couch and in my car now. So happy!\" \u2014 Brittany Get it from Amazon for $122+ (available in three styles). 3. A pet ear cleanser for a gentle, non-toxic way to manage your doggo's dirty ears, especially if they have enough wax in there to make a (very gross) candle! Plus, it'll leave their ears smelling fresh because as much as we love our furry babes, they stink... like, all over... all the time. amazon.com Promising review: \"My husband and I just adopted our cute puppy, Winston, from the Humane Society. When we adopted him, his ears were unfortunately pretty dirty, but after we used this ear cleaner today, his ears are so clean!! I'm so amazed at everything it managed to get out. Our puppy's ears look so much better now! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a dog.\" \u2014 Jerome F Get it from Amazon for $16.99 . 4. Topicals Faded serum to help reduce the appearance of dark spots, scars, and uneven skin tone. Thanks to its formula with antioxidants and inflammation-reducing and brightening ingredients (like kojic acid and niacinamide), many reviewers say the results are definitely noticeable with consistent use! One reviewer even calls it a \"miracle worker.\" Sephora Just so you know, reviewers say that Faded's scent is on the stronger side, but it's totally worth it once the results start happening! Topicals is a WOC-founded small business started by Claudia Teng and Olamide Olowe. The brand is all about helping you love the skin you're in, with a little help from their effective, science-backed products. Promising reviews : \" What is this witchcraft?! I've tried every hyped-up treatment on the market over the past five years to address hyperpigmentation, and none of them had the noticeable impact that Topicals Faded did in just three uses so far. This stuff is amazing. I have no idea why this has been so effective, but I'm a customer for life now.\" \u2014 ShannonD726 \" The hype is real!! This is an instant holy grail for me. Yes, there is a smell when you apply the product, but it dissipates almost instantly. In my opinion, it is worth it for the results. I would rather have a product that actually does what it says as opened to one that is filled with irritating fragrances. This product has revered hyperpigmentation that I have had for YEARS. Please never change!!\" \u2014 KierynJoy Get it from Amazon for $18+ (available in two sizes) or from Sephora for $18+ (available in two sizes). 5.

Promising reviews: \"Product was awesome. It rejuvenated a 5-year-old tattoo and made it look like new again. Mad Rabbit absorbed into the skin very easily without being greasy.\" \u2014 Janson Ward \"This stuff is the best! My girlfriend bought this before but I didn\u2019t like the scent she had, but the spreadability of this was to die for. When I found out they had different scents, I was so excited. I want to get more tattoos just so I can put it all over my body. \ud83e\udd23\" \u2014 Iris Kotico Get it from Amazon for $16.30+ (available in two scents). 6. A bottle of sulfate-free biotin shampoo infused with tea tree and argan oils to help stimulate hair growth. Over time, it's meant to make your locks appear fuller while also nourishing your scalp. More than 36,000 reviewers (with all different hair types) have noticed positive results \u2014 so if you've been searching and searching for a solution to hair thinning, give this a try! www.amazon.com Read more about how biotin shampoo could help with the fullness of hair at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"I love this shampoo! I had gastric sleeve surgery and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo as recommended by my doctor. It doesn\u2019t make your hair grow by washing it but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on) and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal. It's longer and thicker than ever. I still use it twice a week and love it! I [don't love] the way it smells but others love it when they smell my hair.\" \u2014 Diane J. Huff Get it from Amazon for $13.95 . 7. A reviewer-loved retinol body lotion , which is also infused with ferulic acid, shea butter, vitamin E, and green tea \u2014 a wondrous combo that can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, crepy skin, and sun damage on your whole body. Because who said retinol was only for your face?? Like the reviewer below, you'll be kicking yourself for not snagging this sooner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I could kick myself for not trying this sooner! It is my new favorite lotion... After one night of using this, I woke up to smooth, soft moisturized skin that wasn\u2019t itchy at all. This lotion goes on and absorbs beautifully. It\u2019s not too thin or thick, and the scent is sensational... It\u2019s not greasy or slick and does not have a residue that pills or transfers.\" \u2014 TickTokAlice Get it from Amazon for $18.99 . 8. A mattifying I Dew Care dry shampoo powder to dab on your roots anytime your hair is looking a bit too greasy for your liking, but you don't have time to wash it. The ultra-fine, hypoallergenic powder works to absorb oil, sweat, and dirt from your hair, making it look more fresh and voluminous. www.amazon.com , Amazon BTW, this is cruelty-free! Get a look at how it's used on TikTok . Promising review: \"I bought this in desperation after having elbow surgery, which left me unable to wash my own hair. I have tried countless dry shampoo sprays and have been disappointed every time. But this? Absolutely 100% game changer. It kept my hair feeling clean and oil free for several days at a time. It's easy to use, absorbs in quickly, no white residue on my dark hair, and you don't need much. I will never buy another brand again. This is my holy grail of dry shampoo .\" \u2014 Bad Girl Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in six shades). 9. A jar of internet-famous The Pink Stuff \u2014 this all-purpose cleaning paste has over 155,000 5-star reviews for a reason! \ud83c\udf1f It can help remove even the toughest dirt, grime, and rust from your appliances, walls, dishes, floors... you name it!

Promising review: \"I saw someone using this on TikTok and I was skeptical at first, but for $7 I thought I'd try it anyway. I am SO glad I bought this! I had a hair dye stain on the bottom of my bathtub for about a year from dyeing my hair at home, and I tried EVERYTHING...nail polish remover, Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, Scrubbing Bubbles foam spray, etc., with no avail. I also had calcium stains on the drain of my bathtub and sink that were a pain to get out. This product erased all of these stains with ease and made it look like they were never there! This is your sign to buy this...I am so happy!\" \u2014 Savannah M. Get it from Amazon for $5.97 . 10.

It's formulated with jojoba, grape seed, rose, and other oils to help gradually decrease pesky bumps and scars over time. www.amazon.com This product does not promise to work overnight. Apply this daily 2\u20133 times a day as long as needed. Be sure to be patient as the healing process takes time! Talk to your doctor before attempting to treat your keloid on your own, and learn more about keloids from Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"This product is amazing!! Truly a miracle product. I had an AWFUL keloid bump forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done, and it was just getting bigger and more irritated by the day; nothing was helping. I bought this stuff and started using it, and in less than two weeks, my huge keloid was completely gone! I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn\u2019t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then the second week, it started totally disappearing, so make sure to give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick! Also smells pretty good, definitely no bothersome or overwhelming scent which is appreciated in a product that I\u2019m applying on the nose area.\" \u2014 Jordan C. Get it from Amazon for $12.85 (also available in multipacks). 11. Onyx Professional Hard as Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream infused with vitamins, minerals, and emollients to assist fragile nails and help them avoid splitting, chipping, peeling, and cracking. If years of acrylics have done some damage to your nails (same) and you're looking to restore them to their pre-monthly-expensive-fill-ins state, this is here to help. amazon.com Plus, it smells like coconuts! Promising review: \"My natural nails are horrible! They are thin and brittle, and have a tendency to split, peel and break. Consequently, I wore acrylic nails for several years until I got tired of leaving so much money at the nail salon. When I soaked off the acrylics, my nails were, of course, worse than ever, and nothing I tried seemed to restore them to even their original condition until I found Hard as Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream. I rub this into my cuticles and nail beds several times a day, and after two months, my nails are hard and much thicker with no breaking or splitting. For the first time since I took off the acrylics, my nails are growing past my fingertips. This cream is a keeper, I just ordered my second jar, and I'll never again be without it.\" \u2014 M. Hill Get it from Amazon for $7.94 . 12. A foot file so you can scrape off the dead skin and calluses to make your feet soft and smooth again. No more snagging your socks with your dry heels. amazon.com Promising review: \"OMG, these should be standard issue for every human. I\u2019ve bought them all: the cheap foot files, the expensive ones, the Ped Egg, and even a foot file from that direct sales nail wrap company. None of those remotely compare to this one. I thought I was reduced to course heels forever; no more! With just one use, my heels are fabulous! The calluses this thing removed were absolutely disgusting, but I couldn\u2019t be happier. You won\u2019t be disappointed!!\" \u2014 JMart Get it from Amazon for $8.88 . 13. A pack of multipurpose dermaplaning razors for gently removing peach fuzz and dirt from your face and making it feel as smooth as a baby's bottom. Plus, you can use it to shape your eyebrows, too! Which means less money being spent on getting them waxed or threaded every other week. amazon.com Promising review: \"I used to pay a professional to dermaplane my face once a month to remove the peach fuzz, which makes me look older and makes the makeup application more cumbersome. I searched for years for a home product to use to save money and time. This is the closest I have been able to get to professional dermaplaning in the convenience of my home, on my time/schedule, and at a fraction of the price. Love it!\" \u2014 SEM1969 Get a three-count from Amazon for $5.94 (also available in a pack of nine). 14.

Promising review: \"Every winter, my fingers and knuckles crack and bleed. I've tried everything on the market to heal my hands. I received this hand cream yesterday, and when I put it on, I could tell right away that it was better than anything I'd tried. This stuff started working immediately. I filled all the cuts and cracks on my hands with this cream, and today, they are almost healed. I believe that this is the best hand cream ever made on earth.\" \u2014 Steve Get it from Amazon for $9.62 (also available in multipacks). 15.

It is the best, most high-quality, and most popular product you can find at a drugstore. I know people from all walks of life who use it \u2014 it\u2019s a universal favorite. It blends beautifully, has so many color options, and the applicator design is perfect for both use and portability. It\u2019s my go-to every time. I appreciate this product so much \u2014 100 out of 10! \" \u2014 AS Get it from Amazon for $8.80 (available in 24 shades, including color-correctors). 16.

Promising review: \"I don\u2019t usually do reviews on products, but for this one, I absolutely have to. I have 3c type hair and struggle with a lot a breakage, unmanageability, and moisture. When my mom mentioned this product to me, I didn\u2019t take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would have thought this brand would work on my hair ... I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair. This product is so amazing, and I will FOREVER be using this product in my hair regimen.\" \u2014 Theressa Hailey Get it from Amazon for $8.20 . 17. A powerful RMR-86 spray to help get rid of stubborn mold and mildew stains in your bathroom, on your patio, and more. And you don't even have to scrub! Just spray the area and watch the stains (and musty odors) vanish. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this RMR spray with low expectations, even with the good reviews. I sprayed a small patch in the evening and let it sit overnight. The next morning, the grout where I had sprayed was as white as if it were brand new. I decided to spray the entire wall and part of the roof. The next day, everything I sprayed had no visible mold. By the third night, I was pretty much spraying everything left in the shower. This stuff is amazing.\" \u2014 John Werner Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in three sizes and a two-pack). 18. Or a Skylarlife mold and mildew stain remover gel great for those tiny crevices, like silicone and rubber caulking \u2014 because those tubs and showers can get gross within the blink of an eye.

I just received this yesterday, applied it last night and this morning it\u2019s like I have a brand new bathroom. I\u2019m embarrassed to show 'before' and 'after' photos cuz it was so nasty, no matter how hard we scrubbed the mildew wouldn\u2019t go away. I almost cried when I saw my bathroom this mornings. Don\u2019t hesitate, buy this now, you won\u2019t regret it.\" \u2014 Bianca Green Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 19. A descaling solution for an effective way to finally remove the mineral buildup and limescale from your coffee machine or espresso maker. It'll help extend the life of your machine and improve the taste of your coffee. Besides, your most-used kitchen appliance deserves some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. amazon.com Promising review: \"I had never even thought of descaling my 2-year-old Keurig before Amazon suggested it, but this stuff was cheap, I knew I was supposed to descale regularly, and I knew this kind of descaler wouldn't be as hard to rinse out as the smell of vinegar. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the next morning, it took much less time for the water to heat up, and my coffee tasted twice as strong and rich as it did before descaling, which means the brewing temperature is higher now that the heating element isn't caked with mineral deposits. Now I feel a little silly for drinking mediocre coffee for so long.\" \u2014 Lenore Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a two-pack). 20. A bottle of Bread Beauty hair gel , a water-based styler that works for all hair types but is particularly formulated for those with coils and curls to lock in their natural pattern.

Promising review: \"I am not a gel person, but the reviews convinced me...I really thought my hair was going to be this messy, crunchy clump of hair, but it was the complete opposite! In love with the defining gel! Soft, defined, and shiny while keeping my volume! 1000% recommend!\" \u2014 Bakerspassion Get it from Amazon , from Sephora , or Bread Beauty Supply for $26. 21.

Promising review: \"I seriously can't believe how well these little tablets work. I had the most disgusting HydroFlask coffee mug \u2014 I tried everything. A bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING, and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY without even scrubbing. They look brand new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. I liked it so much that I used it on another HydroFlask I use primarily to hold my Bloody Mary mix in the fridge. I couldn't put anything else in it because it would always taste like spicy tomato juice. Bottle Bright to the rescue! No residual smell or taste anymore. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get a 12-pack from Amazon for $8 . 22.

Promising review: \"Naturally, because of the ingredients, it has a strong smell. However, it does seem to leave my dog's skin feeling dry and provides good relief for her poor itchy skin. My dog Molly is a 9-pound mini dachshund whose little chest makes contact with the grass all the time, so her skin gets itchy and irritated. I\u2019ve been bathing her regularly with this shampoo, and it is giving her some relief. No more greasy, flaky skin. Her skin and fur is now dry and soft. \" \u2014 Climbyourarms Get it from Amazon for $9.87 (also available in a larger size). 23. A pack of cleaning erasers to make your kid's coffee table art project ~magically~ disappear. Just wet the sponge with water and wipe the surface down \u2014 that's it!

I was one step away from going to the dermatologist. I had severe dandruff that was so bad, I could shake my head and it would come off. With just a few uses per week, I got rid of all my flakes. My scalp also stopped burning from dryness. My hair has never been healthier. \" \u2014 Moo Moo Get it from Amazon for $15.88 . 25. Essence Lash Princess Mascara \u2014 almost 300,000 reviewers swear by this cruelty- and paraben-free, budget-friendly mascara (and I'm one of them)! It's less than $5 (the price of a latte), it's lengthening, volumizing, and way easier to apply than fake lashes. What else could ya ask for? Kayla Boyd / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Plus, a lot of reviewers say it's even better than the popular Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara! I have this mascara, and it is my FAVORITE (that's my face on the left)! I am constantly buying more when I run out. Plus, it's so dang affordable. Check out my in-depth Lash Princess mascara review . Promising review: \" Better than popular name brands at a fraction of the cost!! As a woman who has bought every mascara out there, from expensive department store exclusives (around $30+ ) to brands found in local drugstores...this mascara rivals and is somewhat BETTER than all I've bought before. It gives your lashes a thick, full length in a few coats. UNBELIEVABLE for the price!! I highly recommend it. You will see for yourself!! I am shocked at how great my lashes look in only two coats!! \" \u2014 Lisa Baker Get it from Amazon for $4.99 . 26. A pack of convenient blotting sheets made to help eliminate that T-zone oiliness on the go. They can be used with or without makeup on and will give your face a nice refresh if you're tired of having a constant oily shine as soon as you leave the house. amazon.com Promising review: \"I LOVE these oil-absorbing sheets! I tried them out a few years ago but didn't get around to writing a review until now. I've tried other blotting sheets, and they've either broken me out or just did not absorb all the oil. Every time I come back to these, I realize they are truly the best. I have SUPER-oily skin (and cystic acne, which I have the scars to show for), and this makes me feel sooo fresh and even calms down active pimples/acne. As you can see, it truly removes all of the oil and keeps it that way for several hours. Very cute design, too, and really easy to use and keep anywhere with you. Amazing price for what it does. If you're hesitating to buy it, just go for it!\" \u2014 Noopur D. Get a pack of 100 sheets from Amazon for $6.95 (available in three formulas and various pack sizes). 27. A pack of cleaning tablets to get rid of all the grime from inside your dishwasher and stop it from having any weird smells and hidden residue. Having a clean machine will help ensure your dishes are actually getting clean, too! amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and just not getting clean. Then, I saw a product test review for Affresh in Good Housekeeping magazine. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway, so I added that to my order. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I am amazed!\" \u2014 Sheila Get a six-pack from Amazon for $8.95 . 28. A Briogeo leave-in conditioning spray formulated with coconut oil and argan oil to help all hair textures minimize frizz for up to 48 hours. Just spritz your hair with this for added shine, smoothness, and a very pleasant scent. Some reviewers say it makes brushing out tangles easier too! Sephora Review with all hair types, from curly to very straight , love it! Briogeo is a Black woman-founded business. Promising review: \"Smooth and hydrated hair. \ud83d\udc93 Instantly, yes. I have struggled to find a leave-in that doesn't make my hair feel greasy afterward, actually hydrates my hair, and uses effective ingredients. It smells amazing. I do appreciate that it is reasonably priced as well. Well done. \ud83d\udc4f\" \u2014 Chrispydao Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes) or from Sephora for $25 . 29. A set of bestselling drawer dividers to keep your socks paired, your undies sorted, and prevent your bras from getting crushed and damaged. amazon.com The set includes four bins: a six-cell (good for scarves, tight, or leggings), an eight-cell (good for underwear, briefs, and ties), a seven-cell (ideal for bras), and a 24-cell (for socks). Promising review: \"No matter how neatly I fold my bras and underwear, they always seem to become a big jumble in the drawer. These organizers are perfect for keeping everything in place, and you won't forget about those items you own that end up buried at the back.\" \u2014 M. Hanson Get a set of four from Amazon for $13.87 (available in seven colors). 30. A pack of thin velvet hangers so you can fit more into your closet and not worry about all of your shirts sliding off right after you've just finished putting your laundry away (finally \u2014 I mean, it's been sitting on that chair for weeks). amazon.com Promising review: \"The difference in my closet because of the hangers alone is striking. I can finally shift clothes to the side to actually see what I have. While some may think that saving their money and dealing with a tight closet is worth it, I am completely sold on making the change. So happy I pulled the trigger. I've purchased 100 more just now so that I can do the same for my boyfriend's closet.\" \u2014 ChristineSD Get a 30-pack from Amazon for $16.29 (also available in 50- and 100-packs and in nine colors). 31. A stainless-steel tongue cleaner to scrape the grossness from your tongue that you probably didn't even realize was there (which can also help get rid of stinky breath). Prepare to be simultaneously disgusted and satisfied because yes, your tongue really is pink underneath all that brownish-yellow gunk! amazon.com Promising review: \"Unfortunately, I, like many, suffer from bad breath and have tried so many things to stop it. I read that sometimes it's the germs on your tongue that can cause it, so I went crazy trying to brush my tongue. Of course, we all know how that ends \u2014 gagging, watery eyes, and it still looks like that gross film is on your tongue. I finally decided that maybe it was time to get a tongue cleaner, and it had to be a stainless steel one because they are easier to clean and sterilize. This product is really easy to use, and I can get very far back on my tongue without activating my gag reflex. Also, it doesn't have the feeling that brushing with a toothbrush does. This cleaner just glides across my tongue, taking all the icky germs and bad breath with it. I love my nice new fresh breath and bolster of confidence!\" \u2014 jordanb Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in packs of two or 12). 32. A jetted tub cleaner so you can get the junk out of your tub and actually be able to have a nice, relaxing bubble bath. There might be plenty of dirt and dead skin cells hiding in those jets, and it has no business sticking around. Simply run your water, pour in some cleaner, and start your jets. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a walk-in tub 18 months ago. I was just looking for something to clean it with. I found this product and watched the video reviews. This product is just as advertised! Even better! When you use your air and water jets, you are recycling the tub water you are sitting in. Soap scum, skin cells, and mold buildup in the pipes. This stuff cleans it all out on the first application. 4 oz is all it takes. The first time I used this product, the tub water looked like I had thrown up in my tub. All this gunk was floating in the water. Great product. I will use this every week.\" \u2014 THOMAS O. MCCUTCHEON Get it from Amazon for $18.73 . 33. A carpet cleaner to once and for all make that huge spaghetti stain in the middle of your living room carpet ~disappear~. Just spritz some on the stain, wait a few seconds, and blot it up. It's like magic! amazon.com Promising review: \"It\u2019s a miracle in a bottle. My German shepherd mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping \u2014 this cleaner lifted the stain, and now it\u2019s like the devastation my dog caused never happened! As soon as I saw it lifting the ink, I got back on Amazon and bought more bottles. I will never let myself run out of this. I use it in my Bissell carpet cleaner for some crazy good cleaning power. I\u2019ve become that weird lady who goes around singing the praises of a cleaning product. No regrets.\" \u2014 L. Logan Get it from Amazon for $6.88 (also available in multipacks). 34. A shower door cleaner so you can finally get rid of the soap scum and hard water stains and make it so that the place where you clean yourself is, well, clean. It's super quick, easy, and effective and you wanna know the best part? It also leaves behind a coating that helps protect the glass from collecting more grossness over the next few weeks! Less cleaning is ALWAYS a win. amazon.com Promising review: \"This product works beautifully. I tried a lot of products to remove the hard water from my glass shower. I have to admit the first time I used it with a cloth, it was not very effective. The second time I used a nonabrasive sponge for glass, it turned out beautiful just like the first day the glass was installed.\" \u2014 EJP Get it from Amazon for $11.65 . 35. Plus! A grout paint marker to turn that icky brown color between your bathroom (or kitchen) tiles into a bright, clean white. Your floors will look brand-new again \u2014 without a bunch of tedious scrubbing (because who has time for that??). amazon.com This won't clean your grout, but it'll make it look brand-new. Promising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom, plus a little of the shower, with one pen. It is pretty forgiving,g and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely. This was not a quick task, but it went faster than I thought it would. I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!\" \u2014 Jenelle Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in wide tip). 36. Heavy-duty cleaning wipes that'll help you quickly and easily clean up grease, oil, dirt, ink, makeup, food, and more on pretty much any surface. No need to take a chunk of time out of what you're doing to hunt down the mop, broom, cleaning sprays, etc. amazon.com Promising review: \"I think these wipes are made out of magic because they can clean just about anything with very little effort! One wipe cleaned my ENTIRE BATHTUB, including the hard water buildup and some residual soap scum. The wipe stayed wet for the entire use, and there was absolutely no sweating involved. I hate cleaning, but I was so pumped about the tub, I took wipe #2 to my hood vent, and good golly, it's like it's brand-new. I've told everyone I know to buy these.\" \u2014 JenM Get a 90-pack from Amazon for $14.98 . 37. A Clorox ToiletWand cleaning kit , which includes a wand, caddy, and six disposable refills, so you can eliminate the germs and stains in your toilet without having to reach down in there or touch anything gross. The scrub pads are preloaded with cleaner, so it's both convenient and effective. amazon.com Promising review: \"So, we have a toilet that belongs to the cats. We don't use it, we don't look at it, we like to pretend it does not exist. Even with semi-regular flushing, cat waste is pretty nasty stuff and builds up quickly in the bowl. One of these wands cleaned it up in a single session! Before-and-after pic attached (above).\" \u2014 Whitney Get it from Amazon for $11.98 . 38. A gas range cleaning spray that'll cut through grease with just a simple spray and wipe. Now you don't have to dread when your partner cooks, knowing that they never clean up the grease splatters. This will make it extra easy! amazon.com Here's why BuzzFeed Shopping editor Daniel Boan loves this stuff: \"This stuff is THE TRUTH. My roommate is the best, but let's just say wiping down the stove after cooking is not one of her favorite activities. I'm not particularly fond of doing the dishes, so I guess we're even. Anyway, I spray this on a few times a week, let it sit for about five minutes, then wipe it with a cloth, and it removes EVERYTHING. Like, every little spot of caked-on grease and burnt crumbs come off with just one wipe.\" Get a two-pack from Amazon for $17.98 . 39. A jewelry cleaning stick to restore your bling and have it looking like it did when it was first purchased. This convenient stick is preloaded with a formula that helps to remove dirt and oils, reduces fine scratches, repels grime, and provides shine! If your engagement ring has seen better days, but you don't want to spend the money on professional cleaning, this will help it get its sparkle back. amazon.com Promising review: \"This little pen brush is incredible! I wasn't sure if it would work well on my emerald engagement ring since it's mostly advertised for diamonds, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have been wearing the ring since getting engaged in October, and even though I had it cleaned at the jeweler's in April, it just didn't seem as bright as it was when it was new, and I thought it would just always be a little cloudy. But after cleaning it once with the Dazzle Stik, I was blown away by the difference \u2014 it looks as bright and sparkly as when I first got it! I'm so glad I didn't buy an ultrasonic cleaner, since this is so much less expensive and easier and gentler. It took me less than a minute to clean, and I can do it whenever I want! And it's honestly better than when the jeweler cleaned it. So thrilled!\" \u2014 KFray Get it from Amazon for $9.48 . 40. A bestselling and surprisingly inexpensive Arvazallia argan oil hair mask that'll strengthen and restore weak and damaged hair. It'll make your locks look shiner and feel healthier (and who doesn't want shiny, healthy hair??). Sure, there are a lot of hair masks out there, but more than 300 reviewers claim this is one of the BEST. amazon.com Reviewers with 4C hair , curly hair , and straight, dyed hair rave about this! Promising review: \"My hair is very thin and curly. The ends are damaged from heat and color, causing my hair to look even more unruly. I do oil treatments once a week and only wash my hair two to three times a week, but NOTHING has made my hair feel like this product does. There is an immediate difference as soon as this product touches my hair. It leaves my hair feeling so silky, even after I rinse it out and dry my hair.\" \u2014 Melissa Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 41. A rubber broom basically guaranteed to make all of your floors look brand-spanking new. The 100% natural rubber brush picks up hair (both pet and human) like a magnet and easily gathers it from carpets, rugs , hardwood, and linoleum. Plus, it has a built-in squeegee on the other side to assist you with liquid spills! Emma Lord/BuzzFeed Promising review: \"I have two dogs \u2014 a terrier mix and a short-hair dachshund mix. I have a navy woven couch that LOVES my dachshund's fur. I have tried pretty much everything to get the fur out \u2014 traditional lint roller, those blue fuzzy lint rollers, special vacuum attachments, etc. The terrier's fur comes out great with all of those options. The dachshund's fur, much like the dachshund herself, remains stubbornly on my couch. I got this product as the new 'let's see if it works' item of the month with low expectations. THE FUR ACTUALLY CAME OUT GUYS. It acts like a broom for my couch \u2014 sweeping the fur (with some elbow grease) basically onto the floor where I vacuum it up! Give this a try if my story sounds pretty similar to yours!\" \u2014 Janielle Get it from Amazon for $19.76 . 42. A wrinkle releaser and fabric freshening spray for mornings when you really don't have time to iron, but you also really need to wear THAT specific shirt for your work presentation. amazon.com Promising review: \"This is literally like an iron in a bottle. It's fantastic. This morning, my shirt had a crease from being folded, but I didn't have time to change, so I misted just one spray on the shirt, shook it out while I was wearing it, and the crease was gone. I cannot express how much I love this! I spray it over my shirts and shake them out a couple of times, then hang them u,p and they are completely wrinkle-free, and it smells like everything just came right out of the laundry, which is also a plus.\" \u2014 Kayla Get a two-pack, plus a travel-size from Amazon for $16.99 (available in five scents and various packs and sizes). 43. An all-purpose scrubber kit \u2014 it comes with three different brushes you can attach to your drill and use to remove any of that hard-to-clean grossness that's caked up on your stove, grill, shower, or floor. What would have taken you hours to scrub can now be accomplished in minutes! You're welcome. amazon.com And if you don't have a drill, here's one on Amazon for $39.59 \u2014 it has over 16,000 5-star ratings! Promising review: \"I bought this on a whim because my walk-in shower is just a pain to clean. I'm 51, and I guess I've just been old school with how I clean, hand scrubbing for years. T he FIRST time I used this to clean my shower, it took five minutes, AND it scrubbed my shower more clean than it has been in years. In the corners, the floor, the glass door...everything came out squeaky clean. I'm NEVER cleaning my shower by hand again.\" \u2014 Terry Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in six bristle stiffnesses).

Emporium Make it easier on yourself, by getting these cheaper versions of pricey Disney souvenirs that we found. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. One thing you\u2019re guaranteed to see at Disney World, are little ones launching bubbles everywhere out of their bubble wands. Join the fun with a cheaper option, with this Disney Mickey Bubble Wand ! \u00a9Amazon Bubble wands are extremely popular at the Parks, they\u2019re one of the most sold items. This bubble wand isn\u2019t much different. The Mickey head shaped wand features sound and lighting effects \u2014 it will blink blue, green, and red. The wand also comes with solution. We think this is a great alternative for kids! You can order these before your trip and already have them ready to go for the parks! View on Amazon This Mickey and Friends Autograph Book is a great deal for those who love to get signatures from their favorite Disney characters! Don\u2019t worry about getting a more expensive autograph book, when you can get one like this. \u00a9Amazon It comes with a Mickey pen and some alphabet stickers, so you can personalize you\u2019re book. We love the cover featuring Mickey and his pals (and sweetheart). The fireworks and castle give it a nice pop as well. Best of all, the item is 46% off at the moment! This one is under $10. The ones in the parks will run you over $20. View on Amazon You\u2019ve probably seen a lot of Disney goers rocking this portable charger. The FuelRod Portable Charger Kit is a must-have! The kit comes with two chargers, and includes all cables and adapters needed for you phone. We LOVE using portable chargers! The kit does come with a rechargeable backup power bank as well. The cool thing about these is you can swap dead one\u2019s for new recharged ones. Just find a kiosk located at different spots around Disney World, and swap out. These are about half the price if you buy them before your trip! View on Amazon Here\u2019s a little shopping hack for you Disney lovers. If you look at the Disney Store online, you can sometimes find Disney ears for a little bit of a discount. We especially love these Minnie Mouse Polka Dot Ears ! \u00a9DisneyStore The reason they can be cheaper online than in person, is because they are often a part of sales. Whereas they almost never go on sale at a Disney Park! These ones are currently $10 off. View Online Like we mentioned with the ears, the same can be said for Spirit Jersey esc tops. It\u2019s always smart to look online first before shopping at the park, because you never know if the one you like could be on sale. Take a look at this Disney World Logo Pullover Sweater ! \u00a9DisneyStore Although it isn\u2019t a typical Disney iconic Spirit Jersey, this is pretty close to. This sweater has the Disney World logo at the front, and has the classic full name print on the back. It\u2019s available at an amazing price right now! View Online The same thing can also be said about designer items \u2014 crazy online shopping hack right! Designer items are very rarely ever marked down at the Parks, but online that\u2019s a different story. We love the style of this Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck Backpack ! \u00a9DisneyStore This bag is designed by Lily Pulitzer ! We love the Hawaiin type theme to the backpack. The colors really pop and mesh well together, and the subtle add of Minnie and Daisy is a chefs kiss. You won\u2019t believe the price it\u2019s going for right now! You\u2019re going to want this for your next Disney trip. View Online You\u2019ve probably caught onto the trend. If you buy Disney souvenirs online, you have a good chance of running into a sale. Whereas in the parks, you most likely won\u2019t find a sale. This applies even to ornaments, like this Cinderella Sketchbook Ornament ! \u00a9DisneyStore We love this ornament capturing the moment Cinderella leaves the ball. She\u2019s got her glass slipper in hand, and the clock has struck midnight. Even Jaq and Gus are featured on the ornament. It\u2019s available online for UNDER $10!

A female jogger is firing back after being criticized for carrying a gun while working out in public. Mikaela Dieppa made her open carry admission in a TikTok clip posted earlier this week, which has clocked up more than 4.2 million views. The mother-of-one, who lives in South Carolina, initially showed off her gun holster as she detailed what she wears while jogging. \u201c[This is my] run outfit of the day. I\u2019m open carrying,\u201d Dieppa declared, flaunting her fashionable fit ahead of her workout. \u201cMy holster is from Amazon, my sports bra and shorts are from Lululemon\u2026 and my favorite running shoes, I\u2019m wearing my Hokas.\u201d 3 Mikaela Dieppa rocks a gun holster as part of her fashionable workout fit. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Explore More Travelers reveal their most bizarre culture shocks when visiting other countries: 'Never get used to it' Hotel guest who paid extra to see the ocean appalled by 'inner city' view \u2014 staff told her to 'lean over the balcony' Tourist couple caught having sex in the middle of the street @mikaeladieppa Protect yourself ladies \ud83d\udc9b #opencarry #womanrunner #gunsafety #runningtips \u266c original sound \u2013 Mikaela Dieppa She defended her decision to be openly armed while exercising, saying: \u201cFor all the people who say I should be concealed carrying when I am on my run, you\u2019re probably not a female who has men slow down and stop to watch them running.\u201d Dieppa claimed that leering men quickly leave her alone when they realize she\u2019s carrying a gun. \u201cProtect yourself ladies,\u201d the locked and loaded brunette captioned the clip. Dieppa told The Post on Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared or paranoid, it\u2019s a fact that women get assaulted in broad daylight all the time, even when taking precautions.\u201d As for the gun, the runner says: \u201cI\u2019d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.\u201d The mom revealed that other women have asked whether they should take similar safety measures, and Dieppa advises: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need it [the gun], but chances aren\u2019t zero.\u201d 3 The gun-toting mama defended her decision to open carry after being criticized by TikTok trolls. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Dieppa\u2019s exercise accessory divided viewers, with some cheering her decision to flaunt the firearm. \u201cEverybody should open carry \u2026.I think everybody should have a gun on them in public,\u201d one defender declared. \u201cCrime would go away.\u201d \u201cOpen carry every time,\u201d another proponent proclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t start nothing, there won\u2019t be nothing.\u201d However, others said Dieppa\u2019s desire to arm herself while exercising was a sad indictment of the American way of life. 3 Dieppa encouraged other women to protect themselves while working out in public.

A cordless grass trimmer that'll help you tackle hard-to-reach areas in your garden bed or simply get the job done if you are the proud owner of a tiny patch of grass. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This tool is awesome and it lasts a long time for trimming around your plants. I love it and recommend for any one who needs to trim around their plants and/or vegetable tree. Mine is a banana tree and was not kept trimmed around it but after getting this tool I'm able to trim around without damaging or making a mess around it.\" \u2014 IC Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in three colors). 2. A variety of sunflower seeds to transform that boring patch of dirt in your yard into a photo shoot\u2013worthy garden without the stress of hand selecting which flowers to plant. Alexa, play \"Sunflower\" by Harry Styles. www.amazon.com Created by Nature is a small business! Promising review: \"Planted a handful of the seeds in our front lawn area. Few months later, and we had a spectacular color array. Great flowers!\" \u2014 Shane Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 3. A standing weeder (without the chemicals!) in case you've found your dream home, but, unfortunately, it came with a grass full of dandelions. Unwind after a busy day at the office with some therapeutic weeding that won't hurt your back. \ud83d\udc4d www.amazon.com Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. Grampa's Weeder is a small business! Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy, has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard, and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun, but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 4. A programmable timer to work some Fairy Godmother-like magic on your hose and transform it into a sprinkler. Bibbidi, Bobbidi, Boo-tiful lawn! Amazon Reviewers mention it's worth using this product with a water hammer arrester . Promising review: \"These timers have been around for a long time. My dad used them for his garden for years without any issue. The batteries last a long time in these things as well. I\u2019m able to program what days of the weeks to water, how frequently (every 12 hours for twice a day), and how long to water each time. Then just leave the faucet on and you\u2019re good to go. If you want to do another watering on hot days or use the hose for another purpose just click the manual button to trigger a manual watering no need to disconnect.\" \u2014 Taylor Get it from Amazon for $35.81 . 5. A row of colorful flower pots with draining holes and hooks that'll brighten up your deck with very minimal effort. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are adorable. I love the colors. They're lightweight and won't hold more than one or two flowers, but they're perfect for the project I did.\" \u2014 JDub Get 10 from Amazon for $18.59 (available in three styles). 6. A fast-acting lawn repair formula made up of grass seeds, mulch, and soil amendment will undo all the damage your beloved doggo (who, obviously, can't help but pee all over your grass) has done to the yard. Now, back to trying to teach Fido *not* to dig up the new grass... www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I used this in the spring to fill out our lawn more, and it worked great! I was worried because I feel like you always hear grass seed horror stories, but I just raked our lawn good, spread seeds all over, and watered it once (sometimes twice) per day and it filled the lawn in beautifully! \" \u2014 Mariah Get it from Amazon for $16.44+ (available in five sizes). 7. A hedge trimmer that'll ensure your neighbors will be peeking over your fence to get a glimpse at how fabulous those bushes look. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have hesitated for years to buy a hedge trimmer but took the plunge on this one. I am pleasantly surprised; lightweight, easy to handle, cuts my shrubs back easily, and trims my 10-foot tall Cyprus cedar with ease!! I'm 76, wish I had bought one years ago!!\" \u2014 George Goddling Get it from Amazon for $39 . 8. Pruning shears , for anyone who has successfully created their own magical rose garden in their yard. Better get yourself a glass jar too to display it like in Beauty and the Beast . Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I purchased these as a gift for my mother who gardens extensively. She thanked me again for them today, declaring that these were the best pruners she has ever owned (she has been at it over 50 years). She cuts the branches off her trees and shrubs, then further trims them into small sections to fit in the recycle trash bags. It is her great joy to work in the yard made even my pleasant through the use of these pruners.\" \u2014 A. Kelly Get it from Amazon for $18.95. 9. And a long-handled lopper to help you can trim any overgrown bushes or trees in your yard, a must-have for anyone who isn't Edward Scissorhands. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Light, easy to use for pruning my trees, but sturdy. Pruning is effortless. So well-engineered. I can't recommend these enough. And they're affordable. My favorite garden tool now. I don't like heavy tools that I can't maneuver or hurt my hands. This is perfect.\" \u2014 Patsy Get them from Amazon for $28.05+ (available in five styles). 10. A galvanized steel planter bed to bring a bit of organization to your yearly garden of veggies and herbs \u2014 this will keep 'em all housed in one easy-to-tend-to spot instead of plopping them directly into the ground. www.amazon.com I have similar garden beds in my yard! I like how it showcases the vegetable garden itself instead of just digging out a spot in our lawn. We had success with our veggies last year, so my husband and I invested in a third planter for this year. Promising review : \"This raised bed is very affordable. The bed looks thin and flimsy at first, but once it is set up, it is very sturdy even though it is very light to carry around empty. I also appreciate that this is a foot tall and not too shallow like some other raised beds being sold . This is an excellent product and I would recommend it highly for what you are paying for.\" \u2014 JT Get it from Amazon for $49.99 . 11. A Scotts seed spreader you'll adore because 1. it comes fully assembled (thankfully) and 2. it'll ensure your grass seed and fertilizer are spread nice and evenly without an extra effort required. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This model is definitely a cut above the other spreaders made by Scott. It is quite well constructed and has lots of nice features like a large hopper, four drop holes, and dual spreader mechanisms. The wheels on this are very nice as well and the edge guard feature works well. Very easy and effective to use and should provide years of use if maintained properly. Beats the pants off of every other spreader I have used. And it's attractive to boot!\" \u2014 Gila Monster Get it from Amazon for $44.97+ (available in four styles). 12. And a seeding square kit , so planting your lil' sprouts won't turn into a game of guess and check. You'll know *exactly* what pattern you planted your basil seeds in this year. www.amazon.com It also comes with a measuring stick called a dibbler that pushes down the dirt to the correct depth for you to drop your seeds. The holes are color coded to let you know exactly where to plant seeds of different varieties. Promising review: \"Love this thing! I have been gardening for a while and this takes all of the guess work out of spacing . I used this for the first time this spring using the planting chart/guide and it has worked out perfectly. I have had little to no weeds (I mean come on, you're gonna get some weeds). Planting per the Seed Square will for the most part choke out the weeds, while promoting growth for the plants. I even used this to plant growing plants and not just seeds. Just put the square on the ground used the stick to mark the spot and dug a hole where it was marked. Simple enough. Would highly recommend. Super easy!\" \u2014 Jennifer Geisel Get it from Amazon for $29.95 . 13. And vegetable, fruit, and herb markers to help you *actually* keep track of what you planted where \u2014 each stick is individually sold and with over 40 options to choose from you should have no problem finding exactly what you need to keep your garden in check.

My Little Belleville / Etsy My Little Belleville is a small business based in Salt Lake City, Utah that sells kitchenware, stationery, and other home goods. Promising review: \"Such a fun way to add more of a thrill into our gardening skills. One set was for my daughter and one for a friend who shares the green thumb phenomena. Adorable designs.\" \u2014 Barbara Get them from My Little Belleville on Etsy for $17.25 (available in seven styles). 16. Or garden gloves with claws that'll make you feel like the Lady Gaga of gardening and make digging in the dirt both easier and more fashionable. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"If you're like me, I typically ditch the gloves when I'm weeding because I can't get a good hold on the smaller weeds. Not with these gloves! They help me dig up those small weeds quickly. I thought I'd have a hard time picking things up because of the claws, but no. They make weeding so much quicker, and save my nails and hands in the process.\" \u2014 MomOfR&D Get them from Amazon for $6.37 (available in four colors). 17. A scent-free mosquito repellent to keep those lil' bloodsucking buggers at bay while you're trying to plant your daisies or pick your cherry tomatoes. Amazon This device uses scent-free repellent mats using naturally occurring repellents found in plants to rid of mosquitoes. Promising review: \"It doesn't smell. It doesn't make noise. It doesn't get hot. It just clears the mosquitos and only mosquitoes! I am the person a mosquito will find from miles away even in my house. The only one they find in a room full of people. I live in a tropical climate and never have a moment's peace in my garden. I've used sprays, foggers, candles, torches, the list goes on. This is the first time I've been able to sit on my patio in peace, even the cat was safe. Already ordered another for a friend and put the refills on subscribe and save.\" \u2014 J&J Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in 13 colors). 18. A soaker hose you can attach to the hose you already own to provide your bushes, plants, and trees with the shower they've always dreamt of (especially during those too-hot summer days). Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a couple of different soaker hoses and this is the best by far. Unlike the rubbery ones that are heavier and more difficult to intertwine and stay where you place them within your plantings, these are easy to curve around, reposition, or remove . They have clamps to securely connect the hose at the hose ends, which helps avoid leaks or breaks. By comparison, the other kind that has the texture of recycled tires, without clamps, leaked at the connection points and disconnected/failed, resulting in the separation of the hose from the hose ends. Any leaking tends to negate the whole function of the soaker hose. In contrast, this style and brand provides a steady, consistent drip along the hose exactly what I want. So far, durability has been good, and the hose will fold up nicely for storage during the winter months.\" \u2014 Gail Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in seven sizes). 19. A soil test kit to relay the moisture in your plant's soil as well as its pH and light levels so you'll know once and for when it needs to be watered. www.amazon.com This device has two needles to ensure accuracy and doesn't require batteries. Just push it 2\u20134 inches into the ground and select what you want to test for. Promising review: \"I have A LOT of plants, with varied water and light exposure requirements. They would probably all be dead from drought or overwatering if not for this little gadget. So simple to use. I recommend it to my fellow plant-lovers in our social media group.\" \u2014 M. Brooks Get it from Amazon for $7.99 . 20. Knee pads you can count on to make the many hours you typically spend gardening on a Saturday morning a bit more comfortable \u2014 a must-have for anyone whose knees simply aren't what they used to be. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are the best knee pads I have ever used. They allow me to stay on my knees for an extended period of time without getting uncomfortable. I have worn them for 9-hour working days without any issues with fit, adjustment, or comfort. They have great cushioning and are very comfortable, but in my opinion what really makes them better than most other knee pads on the market is the fact that they have two adjustable straps with slip buckles instead of one of the straps being Velcro . \u2014 Shannon Huett Get them from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two styles). 21. An expandable garden hose to help you water your grass, the vegetables you planted and prayed will actually grow, and your flower bed without worrying about any kinks getting in the way. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Have used this for about three weeks, watering flowers, grass and washing cars. Have used it almost every day in some way or another. It's very light, easy to maneuver, and doesn't kink. However, I think that's because I followed the directions on the box for how to unwind it for the first time. When I was first unraveling, it kinked in multiple places, so I had to carefully unravel and lay it out fully extended before I even hooked it up to the water source. Has been kink-free ever since.\" \u2014 Sean Cotter Get it from Amazon for $10.06+ (available in seven sizes). 22. An adjustable gardening bench complete with padding for your knees and handles on the sides to assist you in getting up from the crouched position you've likely been in for a *tad* too long while tending to your veggies. It can even be turned into a seat so you can take a true break! www.amazon.com Promising reviews: \"This is great for the garden. It keeps my knees out of the stickers, and the padding is very comfortable, it helps me get up and down \u2014 it is easy to maneuver around the garden and in between the rows. I haven't tried sitting on it, but I'm heavy, and it feels very sturdy under me. Pockets deep enough for tools and seed packets, easy to remove and wash if necessary.\" \u2014 Cpt Dragon \"I bought this for my mother as she had knee surgery, and now she can sit on it while working in her flower and vegetable boxes. Definitely will purchase it again.\" \u2014 Johnnette Murray Get it from Amazon for $23.99 . 23. A plant supporter that'll give your tomato plants and bushes a bit more support so they can grow big and tall \u2014 since they're powder-coated in green they wont' ruin your garden's *~aesthetic~*. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These plant supports each consist of two semi circles that fit together to encircle the plant. I have two snake plants that are getting taller and needed support. These plant stakes are working perfectly . They can easily be inserted into the soil to the desired height, and the green color obscures their appearance. My plants look prettier and stronger now that they are standing tall.\" \u2014 A.Consumer Get a pack of four from Amazon for $14.99+ (also available in an eight-pack). 24. A garden colander to fill up with all of the fruits and veggies you've worked so hard to grow from little seedlings \u2014 wash 'em off outside with the hose to prevent getting dirt all over your kitchen. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I got this for my elderly parents. They always put out a small garden. I thought this would be perfect for them to gather and carry their vegetables in. Another good part is you can rinse them in it, too! My mom said it was too pretty to use for that, but she uses it. It\u2019s convenient!\" \u2014 Samantha Bastin Get it from Amazon for $19.29+ (available in two colors). 25. A pack of seeds that contain, basically, any kind of vegetable you'd want to grow in your garden \u2014 beets, cucumbers, cabbage, butternut squash, and more.

Organo Republic is a small business! Promising review : \"I purchased it for my mother as a gift and I absolutely love the product. Huge variety and very affordable price! The package looks great and each seed bag is individually labeled along with a QR that takes you directly to all the information you need pertaining to that type of vegetables. Love it.\" \u2014 V. G Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (also available in a a variety of 15 and 25 veggie seeds). 26.

All my plants look full and healthy with little to no effort on my part! I am so amazed that for teacher gifts this year, I am giving terrariums and will include a shaker of Joyful Dirt to go with each.

Shuls, Real Clear Wire Skip to content The \u2018learn to code\u2019 fad is done: Why schools should educate for citizenship By James V. Shuls, Real Clear Wire April 12, 2025 Within the past decade or so we have witnessed something remarkable in education \u2013 the rise and fall of a fad we were promised would revolutionize K-12 education. In the 2010s, tech moguls and others began pushing schools to teach students coding skills, often at the expense of other topics. In 2013, Code.org launched with the claim that every student should learn to code. States began promoting computer science as a core subject. By 2016, President Obama put his weight behind the movement with the Computer Science for All initiative. Fast forward to today, and the experts now tell us students may no longer need those once-prized coding skills. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has said the rise of artificial intelligence is making programming skills less relevant. In a leaked memo, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman reportedly stated that AI would likely replace most software engineers. Most recently, entrepreneur and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya echoed these claims: \u201cThe engineer\u2019s role will be supervisory, at best, within 18 months.\u201d What does Palihapitiya suggest students study instead? \u201cPhilosophy, psychology, history, physics, and English writing.\u201d Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The coding fad follows a well-established pattern. A movement is launched with great fanfare, grows rapidly, pushes for widespread reforms, and then fades into irrelevance. Before coding, there was the 21st century \u201cskills\u201d craze, in which schools were told they needed to prepare students for jobs that didn\u2019t yet exist. The recurring theme of many fads in education is their departure from the timeless purposes of education. Rather than cultivating the intellectual and moral virtues necessary for self-government, they focus on workforce readiness. But to sustain a constitutional republic, the public must have both skills. This lesson is clear if we turn to the women of the Founding era. On August 14, 1776 \u2013 barely a month after the Declaration of Independence was signed \u2013 Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John, responding to his complaints about the poor education of young men: \u201cIf you complain of neglect of Education in sons, what shall I say with regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it?\u201d Most women at the time were not given a proper classical education. They did not read the Greek and Roman poets or moral philosophers. They were unfamiliar with Virgil, Ovid, or leading English thinkers like John Milton and John Locke. Instead, they were taught what we might call \u201c18th-century skills\u201d \u2013 needlework, music, drawing, and etiquette. Abigail Adams knew that an education that focused on domestic tasks or job preparation was insufficient for a free and self-governing society. \u201cIf we mean to have Heroes, Statesmen and Philosophers,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe should have learned women.\u201d It was exactly that kind of education, rooted in the classics, that propelled several leading women of the time to prominence. Mercy Otis Warren, tutored in classical literature alongside her brothers, authored poetry and satirical plays that supported the Revolution and stirred the affections of the colonists. A similar story can be told of the enslaved poet Phillis Wheatley, who inspired the young nation through her verse. Influenced by the evangelical minister George Whitefield, Wheatley\u2019s enslavers provided her with a classical education alongside their own children. Upon receiving a poem from Wheatley, George Washington wrote, \u201cThe style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical talents.\u201d Adams, Warren, and Wheatley stood out because they were educated for citizenship . That\u2019s what an education grounded in the classics \u2013 the best that has been written and thought in human history \u2013 can do. It produces people equipped to think deeply, to reason morally, and to lead wisely. Americans intuitively yearn for this type of education. In a recent poll of more than 2,400 people conducted by the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University, participants were asked what would make U.S. education better. The most popular responses \u2013 selected by roughly 85% of respondents \u2013 included requiring schools to teach the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and mandating an approach to civics that focuses on the Constitution. Seventy-eight percent supported requiring students to demonstrate competence in American history to graduate high school. And 67% favored an education focused on the great texts of Western Civilization \u2013 the very texts Adams, Warren, and Wheatley read. It may be time to move on from coding, but the danger is that we\u2019ll simply replace it with yet another skill set that will soon become obsolete. That would be short-sighted. Today\u2019s students must be trained for the job market \u2013 and also prepared for the responsibilities of self-government. Job skills change. Technologies fade. But an education grounded in civic understanding is timeless and can provide long-term stability to our republic. James V. Shuls, Ph.D., is the Head of K-12 Education Reform at the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

It's lacks a reverse switch, which is problematic if you should be working in limited space (as it is designed to do) and can get stuck if the bolt doesn't have enough clearance to be removed. vid1900 HF Quinn has a set of low profile sockets that fit this, although often, they are more money than the genuine Astro ones.

The Tekton is beefier than the Astro Tools, and is double ended with a flex head on one end and a fixed box on the other end. It's 17 inches long, a bit shorter than the Astro Tools. Tekton web site claims it has a proof torque of 450 ft lbs, nearly double the ASME standard for a 22mm flex head. Astro Tools doesn't give any info on proof torque for their wrench. Tekton is $36 but worth it. 4 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 2 Replies stasis Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM 5,909 Posts Joined Apr 2008 Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM stasis Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM 5,909 Posts Quote from vid1900 : HF Quinn has a set of low profile sockets that fit this, although often, they are more money than the genuine Astro ones.

Discover SCENE Jianwei Xun, the supposed Hong Kong philosopher whose book \"Hypnocracy\" claims Elon Musk and President Donald Trump use utopian promises and empty language, never really existed, at least not physically. Instead, the acclaimed author was a \"collaborative\" creation between Andrea Colamedici, an Italian publisher, and two AI tools \u2013 Claude from Anthropic and ChatGPT from OpenAI. \"I wanted to write a book that would help people better understand the new ways power manifests itself,\" Colamedici told Decrypt . But it wasn't until after an investigative report from L'Espresso that Xun's website was updated to acknowledge the experiment, snapshots from Wayback Machine reviewed by Decrypt show. Still, the book received critical acclaim. L\u2019Espresso reports that L\u2019Opinion , a French daily, had detailed how President Emmanuel Macron had \u201cappreciated\u201d Xun\u2019s writings. Earlier in February, a roundtable at the World AI Cannes Festival extensively discussed Xun\u2019s ideas. \u00c9ditions Gallimard, a leading French publisher, has committed to a new translation from the Italian original, after the first edition in French from Philosophie Magazine. A Spanish translation from Editorial Rosamer\u00f3n is slated for release on April 20. Vibe philosophy? Xun was \"an exercise in ontological engineering,\" Colamedici explained in a post-revelation interview with Le Grand Continent . While this experiment with AI looked novel, critics point out the book could be in trouble. The European Union's AI Act , approved in March 2024, considers failure to label AI-generated content a serious violation \u2013 a requirement critics claim Colamedici's experiment disregarded. In previous versions of its bio, Xun was described as a \"Hong Kong-born cultural analyst and philosopher\" who studied at \u201cDublin University.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. According to an anonymous source from the University College of Dublin's philosophy department, no person named \"Jianwei Xun\" exists in their database or those of other Dublin-based universities. \"The fact that the author had inverted the Chinese order 'surname-name' was an immediate red flag,\" Laura Ruggieri, a Hong Kong-based researcher, told Decrypt , explaining how she spotted inconsistencies as early as February. Ruggieri previously taught semiotics\u2014the study of symbols and signs\u2014at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She asked her colleagues about Xun. Nobody knew who that was. \u201cNot a single one of them has ever met Xun or heard his name,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cIf Colamedici had used his real name and admitted that AI had written the book, no one would have bought it.\u201d Responding to those allegations to Decrypt , Colamedici claimed these were deliberate clues \"left for those willing to question and investigate,\u201d claiming the revelation was \"predetermined.\" \u201cWe actually did everything possible to make Xun\u2019s non-existence evident to anyone with even minimally inquisitive eyes,\u201d Colamedici said. Colamedici insists that AI did not write the book. Instead, Claude and ChatGPT \"served as interlocutors.\" In the words of Xun The book describes itself as a \"journey into the fractured mirror of modern reality,\" and discusses how Musk and Trump have constructed an alternate reality through obsessive repetition. It was written \"for those who suspect that the world they see is only a shadow of something far more complex,\" its Amazon blurb claims. Xun's thoughts center on \"hypnocracy,\" describing a regime that exerts control through \"algorithmic modulation\" of collective consciousness instead of censorship. In English: fake news. Xun claims that Trump's speeches and social media posts create conditions of uncertainty. Trump \"empties language: his words, repeated endlessly, become empty signifiers, devoid of meaning yet charged with hypnotic power,\" Xun wrote. Xun claims Musk makes promises \u201cdestined not to materialize,\u201d by \u201cflooding our imagination\u201d with ventures such as space colonization and neural interfaces. \"Together they modulate desires, rewrite expectations, colonize the unconscious,\" the AI philosopher wrote. Spokepeople for Musk and Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2.

I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3.

Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used!

Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7.

I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors.

I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier!

Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17.

Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19.

Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20.

This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT.

Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22.

And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Been using them since high school! The amount of junk and buildup that comes off is so satisfying to see! It can be irritating when removing, especially if you have sensitive skin.

I tried this product on a whim\u2026and boy am I glad!! I wash, rinse and dry in the morning and they are dry and ready for use by lunch if I need a touch up. It does take a few minutes but SO WORTH it!! They more I use it, the faster I am getting. My brushes look new after and feel so much better on my skin. My makeup even goes on nicer.

Definitely a great buy at an extremely affordable price. The quality exceeded my expectations. It is so soft, true to size and color, wrinkle-free, and has a well-made zipper at the bottom. There are also ties on the inside to keep your duvet in place. I absolutely LOVE everything about this cover. Can\u2019t wait to get home in my bed after a long, exhausting work shift on my feet. My furbaby loves it too! Thanks Amazon for simplifying my life! \u2764\ufe0f\" \u2014 Theresa Get a set from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in sizes twin\u2013oversized king and in 30 colors). 29.

Now all your books can look like they've been perpetually Wingardium Leviosa-ed! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are so much fun! We ordered the small size, which fits standard hardback books (approximately 5\u20137 hardbacks in my experience). They're a great way to add some extra storage to our very small home, and we've placed them in our hallway so people ask us about them all the time. I'd highly recommend!\" \u2014 LaBuenaVidaMere Get a set of three from Amazon for $23.65 (available in two sizes). 31.

Just attach the clips to both straps in the back, and voila! \u2014 no one can see your bra straps from the front. Amazon Promising review: \"My bra straps spent more time off my shoulders than on them. I have bras that fit perfectly, but the straps are too wide-set or something. I'm so glad I bought these little bra strap clip holders because they've solved the problem. I've used them for three days now, and my straps have not fallen off of my shoulders even once in that time. Amazing! I love them! I put a clip holder on my bra and then put the bra on like a T-shirt \u2014 over my head, put my arms in, then fasten it as usual in the back \u2014 pretty easy. The length of the clip holders are adjustable. I have fully extended them to fit across the back of my 38DD bras. At first it felt a bit odd because it was different, but it doesn't take long to adjust to the feel of it. The strap clip holders do the job, and they are pretty cheap, so give them a try. \" \u2014 Polly Esther Get a set of three from Amazon for $5.97+ (available in eight sets with different colors). 32.

So. Much. Room. There is so much room left in my drawer now that I moved stuff from another drawer and I have an entirely empty drawer in my kitchen now.

Promising review: \"My skin is 100% softer and feels far smoother thanks to this product!!! The difference was noticeable after ONE use, its true. All the grime, rolled up skin, flakes and chucks \u2014 shudder, that was on me??? Everything other customers are saying about how disgusting it is when you see how much dead skin sloughs off is true. I disagree that it only comes off after the first use though \u2014 I have continued to see improvement over the time I've used it, about six weeks, and even some age-related and sun damage discoloration is gone.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

EPCOT The HOKA Bondi 8s are undeniably comfy \u2014 we\u2019re talking marshmallow soles, maximum cushion, all the foot-hugging support you could want. But the truth is that we don\u2019t always wear them in Disney World\u2026 and yeah, we\u2019ve got our reasons. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. First, let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: HOKA Bondi 8s are built for comfort. If you\u2019ve ever worn them, you know that soft landing and pillowy feel underfoot. \u00a9Amazon It\u2019s like walking on memory foam. They\u2019ve got great arch support, a wider base for stability, and that oversized midsole is a lifesaver on long walking days. We totally get why so many people swear by them. In fact, most of our AllEars team lives in their HOKAs when they\u2019re in the parks. Grab them here But here\u2019s the painfully honest truth: they\u2019re chunky. Like, really chunky. And while that\u2019s part of the design (and part of what makes them so comfortable), we can\u2019t help but feel a little\u2026 clunky in them. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but when you\u2019re already sweating through your tank top and trying to get a cute castle photo? Yeah, it matters. \u00a9Amazon We own the Bondi 8s and do wear them \u2014 just not all the time. Especially not when we\u2019re trying to put together a cuter park look. We know, we know, style shouldn\u2019t come before comfort when it comes to Disney shoes, but sometimes we reach for other shoes instead. They\u2019re sleeker, they pair better with our outfits, and even if they don\u2019t treat our feet quite as nicely by hour eight\u2026 we do it anyway. We suffer a little for the \u2018fit. And we\u2019re not proud of it, but we\u2019re being honest here. So let\u2019s weigh the pros and cons: HOKA Bondi 8 Pros: Extreme comfort and support \u2014 seriously, A+ Great for people who need extra cushioning or have foot pain Durable and reliable even after long days in the parks Fit for actual running (or chasing Lightning Lanes) HOKA Bondi 8 Cons: Bulky, heavy look that doesn\u2019t always go with every outfit Can feel a little stiff at first and take up a lot of space in your suitcase Expensive \u2014 if you\u2019re only wearing them for Disney, they\u2019re an investment Let\u2019s talk about the alternative sneakers we\u2019re reaching for: First, we\u2019ve got these New Balance Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s Oxford Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon They\u2019re still cushy but way more streamlined. Plus, they have a fun retro vibe that works with most of my park outfits. Grab them here Next up, we\u2019ve got these Brooks Women\u2019s Adrenaline GTS 23 Supportive Running Shoes : \u00a9Amazon These are solid running shoes with real support. They\u2019re not quite as chunky as the HOKAS but still have that plush, reliable feel. If you want all-day comfort in a slightly more streamlined silhouette, this is a great option. Grab them here Lastly, we\u2019ve got these adidas Women\u2019s Cloudfoam Pure Sportswear Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon If your Disney style leans sporty-chic, these are a great pick. The foam is soft, the fit is flexible, and the design is cute enough to blend with pretty much any park outfit. Grab them here At the end of the day, wear what works for you. If you\u2019re prioritizing function over fashion, HOKAs are probably your best bet. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s fully committed to comfort (you should be!), don\u2019t let the look stop you. \u00a9Amazon But if you\u2019re like us \u2014 balancing comfort with aesthetics, especially when you\u2019ve planned a whole Disney look \u2014 we totally get reaching for a sleeker sneaker even if you know your feet will hate you by dinnertime. And yes, we know this is a hot take. But someone had to say it. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the best Disney essentials, so make sure you stay tuned to AllEars for more!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about lifestyle tech Follow Author Apr 12, 2025, 12:45pm EDT Share Save Comment Updated April 12 with more details of offers and deals. Amazon has new price cuts for iPhones which take select models right back to their Spring Sale lows. The discounts apply to the the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and the iPhone 16 Pro versions, too. In fact, all the phones in the iPhone 16 series are represented apart from the newest of all, the iPhone 16e, which is the most affordable of the range. What\u2019s more, there are bargains to be had if you\u2019d like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, as well. Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus prices are down at Amazon. Getty Images Amazon U.K. has discounted the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max by \u00a3100 or more. The deals highlighted in this post were independently selected by the Contributor and do not contain affiliate links. Forbes Apple Intelligence For iPhone To Add Google Gemini In Weeks, Report Claims By David Phelan Let\u2019s start with the iPhone 16. The entry-level model has 128GB storage and comes in four colors, of which three are discounted in this storage level. Choose between pink, teal and white to find the iPhone with 13% off. That takes the price down by \u00a3101, from \u00a3799 ($1,019) to \u00a3698 ($890). Here\u2019s the link for the iPhone 16. MORE FOR YOU Microsoft\u2019s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users \u2018Worse Than 1971\u2019\u2014U.S. Dollar Price \u2018Collapse\u2019 Predicted To Ignite $22 Trillion Bitcoin Challenge To Gold Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 12th If you\u2019re mad about the Ultramarine color, and I couldn\u2019t blame you, there are savings available if you choose the 512GB version. The regular price for this is \u00a31,099 ($1,402) but it has a 9% discount, which also works out at \u00a3101 off, making it \u00a3998 ($1,273). The same price applies for the pink, teal and white finishes. The fifth color, black, is not worth having at the current Amazon price of \u00a31,202.79 for the 128GB storage model. The iPhone 16 with 256GB storage is also not available. Fancy a bigger screen? The iPhone 16 Plus is discounted by 11%, taking its regular \u00a3899 ($1,147) sticker down by \u00a3101 (spotting a pattern here?) to \u00a3798 ($1,018). You only get to choose the white finish at this price, please note. Here\u2019s the iPhone 16 Plus link . There\u2019s more choice for the 256GB storage option, a 10% discount of \u00a3101 brings the \u00a3999 ($1,275) price down to \u00a3898 ($1,146). All colors except black available. The full range of colors is discounted on the largest storage of 512GB. Down from \u00a31,199 ($1,530) by 8% or, you guessed it, \u00a3101, the new price is \u00a31,098 ($1,401) and you can choose between black, pink, teal, ultramarine and white. If you can\u2019t resist the three cameras and titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro, these are discounted, too. Here\u2019s the link. All four colors are available for the 128GB storage models. That means Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and White Titanium are all 10% off, that means the regular \u00a3999 ($1,308) price is knocked down by \u00a3100 ($131) to \u00a3899 ($1,178). And you\u2019ll notice the magic spell of \u00a3101 off has been broken on this model, though only just. Forbes Apple\u2019s Stealthy New Music Upgrade For Windows PCs Beats Microsoft By David Phelan Same for the 256GB model, which also sees \u00a3100 ($131) off, across the board. Here it\u2019s a 9% discount, taking the \u00a31,099 ($1,439) sticker down to \u00a3999 ($1,308). All four colors available. Step up to 512GB storage and something eerily predictable happens: all four colors available with \u00a3100 ($131) off. This means an 8% price cut, so the regular \u00a31,299 ($1,701) price drops to \u00a31,199 ($1,570). The same \u00a3100 ($131) cut means the regular \u00a31,499 ($1,963) price for the 1TB storage option is \u00a31,399 ($1,832). The biggest phone of all is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a 6.9-inch display. Check this link and you\u2019ll see a wholly unsurprising discount in place. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s \u00a3100 ($131) off the 256GB model \u2014 the lowest-capacity storage option for the Max \u2014 which reduces the price from \u00a31,199 ($1,570) to \u00a31,099 ($1,439), with all colors ready to ship. The 512GB version also (can you believe it?) shows a \u00a3100 ($131) price cut. That\u2019s a 7% discount and brings the regular \u00a31,399 ($1,832) sticker to \u00a31,299 ($1,701. All colors available. The 1TB option, regularly \u00a31,599 ($2,094) down by \u00a3100 ($131), as you may have guessed. This 6% price cut means you\u2019ll pay \u00a31,499 ($1,963). Lastly, there\u2019s the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Last year\u2019s standard iPhones may not have all the love expended on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which arguably took the regular phones closer to the Pro models than before, but they\u2019re still worth considering, especially when the prices are reduced as here. Apple will sell you the iPhone 15 with 128GB storage for \u00a3699. On Amazon ( here\u2019s the link ), all five colors are available for \u00a3598. That\u2019s 14% off and our old friend the $101 discount reappears. The five colors, by the way, are yellow, green, pink, blue and black. Trade up to 256GB and instead of the regular \u00a3799 price you can find all five for \u00a3698. The larger-display iPhone 15 Plus, usually selling for \u00a3799 with 128GB storage, has dropped to \u00a3698, that\u2019s 13% off but only in green and pink. The 256GB storage has dropped from \u00a3899 to, yes, that\u2019s right, \u00a3798, which is an 11% discount. You can choose between blue and black for this deal. The 512GB storage option is available for this larger phone, wih the same \u00a3101 discount, taking the price from \u00a31,099 to \u00a3998. Choose between black and, no, that\u2019s it, just black. Incidentally, if U.S. readers see the price translations and feel the Brits are paying well over the odds compared to prices in the States, remember that U.S. prices are quoted pre-tax and U.K. ones have all sales taxes included, so the disparity isn\u2019t as steep as it looks. And if price rises cut in Stateside because of tariffs, then iPhones could even be cheaper on the other side of the pond one day.

A colorful wireless keyboard and mouse set for adding some joy-inducing color to your workspace without any bothersome cords to tie you down. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com The set includes a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse with a USB receiver. Pick up some AA batteries \u2014 both will need them! Promising review: \"Every time I walk into my red office and see this beautiful keyboard, it makes me happy. It looks just like it does in the photo. It's such a jolt of color, and with its cool circular retro buttons, it's just a pleasure to use. If you need a pick-me-up (and who doesn't this year?), I can't recommend this highly enough.\" \u2014 CA-girl Get it from Amazon for $40.99 (available in 14 styles). 2. An aesthetic flexible power strip so you can actually utilize each and every outlet even when your excessively massive laptop charger is present. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com iJoy is a small business selling a variety of tech accessories, speakers, and headphones. Promising review: \"I rarely write a review (this is the second in the past few years). One of the best purchases in a long time. Nice design and very practical. It solves all of my problems as it can go any direction. It's worth every penny. I turned around and bought two more. I am about to buy my fourth one. Love this!\" \u2014 Pond P. Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in three colors). 3. A ventilated cable management box if you're tired of tangled cords trapping your feet and offending your eyes. Amazon Promising review: \" A must-buy product for your messy home or office. Exactly what I was looking for to help save space and hide my cable cords.\" \u2014 Andrew Olson Get it from Amazon for $15.99 . 4. An ergonomic nonslip mouse pad because it's the wrist-aligning support system you need to fire off hot takes on Slack with minimal pain and discomfort. www.amazon.com Read more about how an ergonomic mouse can help prevent carpal tunnel at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"The design is gorgeous and so comfy that I even take it when I travel for business. This has relieved wrist pain from working on the computer every day.\" \u2014 Bianka P Gonzalez G Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in 21 patterns). 5. A 52-sheet to-do list pad for when you're overwhelmed with all the things that need doing and just don't know where to start. Blank legal pads do not inspire, but this cutie sure does! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I LOVE this product! I live off lists every day at work, and this keeps me super organized! I have my daily list, top three priorities, things I need to remember for the next day, and miscellaneous notes all on the same page!\" \u2014 Ldsappy Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in six colors/styles). 6. A USB-powered LED light strip to give your desk area a futuristic glow while working double-duty to reduce eye fatigue and hopefully keep those pesky headaches at bay when you're pulling extra long shifts. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have procrastinated in writing this review and am actually happy to say that after a year, the product is continuing to stay strong. The adhesion is as strong as it was on day one, and this product continues to meet and exceed expectations. I have noticed significantly less eye strain. If I were needing computer monitor backlighting again, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase. \" \u2014 college_engineer Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes). 7. A cooling memory foam seat cushion that's unassuming enough to blend in with most any desk chair and will make you feel ~supported~ even on your longest days. www.amazon.com The velour cover zips off for easy cleaning in the washing machine. Promising review: \"I've purchased similar items in the past that visually looked like this but were stiff and rigid. This is amazing. Totally eased my back pain from my quarantine-at-home desk job . Highly recommend.\" \u2014 Bellarosa555 Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in seven colors). 8. Or a whimsical paw chair cushion so you can add an extra layer of comfort *and* cuteness to cradle your booty while you're on the clock. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Got this for my office desk. It definitely stands out, and the older ladies at my work love it! It works well as a seat cushion, as my office chair is so thin I can feel the metal and plastic bits when sitting. With the cushion, it's super soft and comfortable!\" \u2014 Jane Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). 9. An electric mug warmer because nothing ruins your cozy desk vibes quite like reaching for your coffee only to find it's gone cold. With this chic little warmer, you can join the slow sippers club without having to make a bazillion trips to the microwave. If this seems like one big fire hazard to you \u2014 fear not \u2014 there's a built-in auto shutoff! Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Reviewers suggest turning the heat down from high to medium once the drink gets down to about the halfway point so it stays a comfortable temperature! Check it out on TikTok (where one reviewer even has the genius idea to use it as a candle warmer at their desk, too)! BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes wishes she had bought it sooner: \"After seeing this coffee warmer all over BuzzFeed Shopping and even gifting my dad one for Christmas, I finally decided to buy one for myself. Based on all the reviews, I was pretty confident I'd soon be kicking myself for not getting it sooner, and that proved to be true: This thing not only looks good but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long. (Because yes, I'm one of those people who'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!) I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste. Also, I looove how sleek the white version looks on my white desk, and the auto-shutoff function is a nice safety feature for an absent-minded person.\" Get it from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in nine styles). 10. A slim desktop whiteboard if your desk is littered with distracting sticky notes that always seem to get lost anyway. This memo board is designed to fit comfortably between a keyboard and a monitor, creating a designated place where you can write out all your absolutely-cannot-forget reminders again and again and again. www.amazon.com The whiteboard also comes with a dry-erase marker, an accessory channel (to hold the marker), and a storage drawer. Promising review: \"Never thought something analog would be SO useful in my daily routine. I work from home and am constantly project managing a number of complex strategic projects. Having pertinent information directly in front of me and top of mind has done incredible things for my productivity . Never would have imagined it would make such a difference. For a nominal investment, I highly recommend it if you have trouble keeping up with things.\" \u2014 Captainflapjax Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in four styles). 11. Or a wall-mounted acrylic dry-erase board for a major aesthetic upgrade to standard dry erase boards with all the same schedule-tracking, note-taking, and organizing prowess. 1801 & Co. / Etsy 1801 & Co. is a Minnesota-based Etsy shop established in 2016 that specializes in family wall calendars, chore charts, wedding signs, and more. Promising review : \"I love it! I got it so fast after ordering, and it\u2019s perfect . I love the sleek design for my small home office space. I can\u2019t function at work without a dry erase board but couldn\u2019t find any that would look nice in my office space, which is in the corner of my master bedroom! Having functional office space without LOOKING like an office in the bedroom is challenging, but this acrylic board is PERFECT. The black pen that comes with it is very nice fine tip and erases without a trace.\" \u2014 Dawn Powell Get it from 1801 & Co. on Etsy for $32.73+ (available in 19 sizes and three hardware styles/finishes). 12. A jumbo printed desk pad to cover up all those stains, chips, and scratches (How'd those even get there?) with any one of a vast collection of colors and patterns to suit any taste. Plus, you'll LOVE all the free-range mouse movin' you can do with all this newfound space. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really like this mat \u2014 I've had it for several months now, and it hasn't faded or scuffed at all. Makes my basic office cubicle desk a little prettier and does the job I really needed it for \u2014 to soften the surface of my desk because I hate the way my mouse sounds without a mousepad. Several coworkers have complimented the design and asked for the link! \" \u2014 AliB_Art Get it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in 24 colors/prints). 13. Super pretty rainbow prism sun catchers so you can bask in sunny rainbows even if you're stuck inside working. Who can't help but smile at a rainbow?! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I put two of these in my home office window, where the sun shines in the morning. Every morning, it's an explosion of cheerful rainbows and sunshine, and it just makes me happy to be alive! The quality is excellent. Even though they aren't crystal, I honestly don't think you would ever see a difference if they were, other than being a few hundred dollars poorer. They are heavy, remarkably clear, smooth, crisp facets, and appear flawless.\" \u2014 Dr Hall Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.98 . 14. A capybara desk companion that'll just about force a smile out of you whenever it catches your eye, even when Jake from IT is getting on your last nerve.

A precious little mushroom lamp if you're short on space but big on your love for all things cottagecore. This lovely little mush casts a soft glow across your desk, with 16 colors and four brightness levels easily controlled with a remote. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"Cute, cute, cute! This is one of the cutest night-lights ever! Not only does it change colors, but it can also be controlled remotely and changed in a variety of colors and effects, from flashing to slowly fading from one color into another, or if desired, one constant color to match any decor. The brightness can also be adjusted. And the wood base gives it more than the look of a toy; it is perfectly classy.\" \u2014 roika Get it from Amazon for $22.99 . 16. A space-efficient bamboo multi-device charging dock for corralling the sprawling mess of tech and chargers into one designated display that practically doubles as decor. www.amazon.com Great Useful Stuff is a Utah-based small business selling a tight selection of home and lifestyle goods that embody the brand's name. Promising review: \"My desk was full of chargers and cords. This really helps keep everything organized and puts those cords out of sight. I also use the dividers to store a notebook, so you can use it for other things besides computers, phones, etc. I also really like the material. I got the light bamboo.\" \u2014 Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $48 (available in four other styles). 17. A tufted height-adjustable swivel chair to bring a warm sense of cozy into your WFH cubicle that almost looks too good to be considered so comfortable by so many reviewers. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is great. The chair is perfect. I bought this as my desk chair and it\u2019s awesome. The set up is very easy and quick. It\u2019s also very comfortable. It looks exactly as pictured.

This little guy has a majorly big mouth that's perfect for stashing sweets, keys, or anything else that might need a fearsome protector. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Honestly better than I thought it would be. It looked cool online, and I bought it as an impulse buy and was not disappointed. It's heavy and well-made. If I had any complaint, it's that due to the shape of the jaw, some jelly beans fall out if I don't grab them carefully, but I've decided that's a small price to pay for this epic protector sitting on my desk.\" \u2014 David Get it from Amazon for $44.98+ (available in three colors). 25.
