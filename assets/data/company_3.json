By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

In 2025, its parent company, Alphabet, is a vast multinational technology conglomerate and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. While much of Alphabet\u2019s growth was internal, it also added to its empire through shrewd acquisitions, including of Android, DoubleClick and YouTube. Since 1998, it has acquired at least 267 companies . Alphabet is a key player in many digital markets, including general search, browsers, online advertising, mobile operating systems and intermediation. Google Search, for example, is now the most widely used general search engine in the world. Globally, its market share has been at least 78% for the past 10 years . Unsurprisingly, antitrust agencies, whose task is to protect competition, have been taking a close look at Google\u2019s conduct and that of other tech giants. While having market power is not illegal if it is the result of a superior product, protecting such a position by means that are not meritorious is. A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers. It provides an introduction to the diversity of research coming out of the continent and considers some of the key issues facing European countries. Get the newsletter! Google\u2019s conduct under scrutiny In recent years, there has been growing concern that Google may be using anticompetitive means to protect and extend dominant positions in core digital markets. In 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , the European Commission fined Google over \u20ac8 billion for abusing dominant positions in key markets \u2013 more than any other Big Tech company to date. A fourth investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the advertising technology market , in which the European Commission is likely to request structural changes to Google\u2019s advertising business, is nearing completion. The national competition agencies of the EU member states have also actively enforced EU and national abuse-of-dominance rules. Private antitrust class actions for damages are adding to Google\u2019s woes. In 2022, the EU enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to create an additional tool for intervening against entrenched market power in core platform markets. The DMA regulates the behaviour of so-called gatekeeper companies, aiming to make markets more contestable for competitors and fairer for users. In September 2023, the European Commission designated Alphabet as a gatekeeper in no fewer than eight platform markets for the following services: Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Google Ads, Chrome, YouTube and Google Android. Within days of the DMA\u2019s conduct rules becoming binding on Alphabet in March 2024, the European Commission opened the first noncompliance investigation to assess whether Google Search was continuing to treat Alphabet\u2019s own services more favourably than its rivals\u2019, and whether Google Play prevented app developers from steering consumers to other channels for better offers. For the Trump administration, EU rules amount to non-tariff restrictions The territorial scope of these rules is limited to services offered in Europe. They do not regulate how Google operates in the United States \u2013 this is subject to US antitrust law. Nonetheless, the European Commission\u2019s enforcement actions have provoked the ire of the current US administration. In February 2025, the White House issued a memorandum titled \u201cDefending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties\u201d that takes issue with European antitrust and regulatory measures against US companies. According to the Trump administration, the EU\u2019s rules amount to non-tariff restrictions and unfair exploitation of US companies, and they interfere with American sovereignty. The memorandum stresses that Washington will not hesitate to impose tariffs and other actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States. According to the European Union, such actions would amount to economic coercion and interfere with its legislative sovereignty to decide under what conditions services are offered on European soil. In 2022, likely with the possibility of a second Trump presidency in mind, it enacted the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument , which allows the European Commission to impose a wide range of \u201cresponse measures\u201d, including tariffs and restrictions on imports, exports, intellectual property rights, foreign direct investment, and access to public procurement. Such response measures could be imposed on US digital services. Potential for escalation The situation has the potential to further escalate the risk of a trade war between Europe and the United States. However, the dispute over tech regulation does not appear to be about substantive antitrust principles per se. In 2020, the US House of Representatives issued a bipartisan report stressing the need for the United States to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice subsequently brought antitrust lawsuits against all four companies, most of which are still pending. The Department of Justice filed two separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020 and in 2023 . In the first case, a Washington DC district court in August 2024 found Google guilty of violating section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and established that Google had attempted to protect its monopoly power in the market for general search through anticompetitive means. Judge Amit P. Mehta is now determining appropriate remedies, and the Department of Justice recently reiterated its request that the judge break up Google . The second US case against Google is still pending. The accusations in it are similar to those underlying the European Commission\u2019s ongoing investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the market for advertising technology. While the case was initiated during the Biden administration, it has not (yet) been shut down since Trump returned to power. It\u2019s also worth noting that the new head of the Federal Trade Commission has stressed that Big Tech is a main priority of his agency . There seems to be concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Google has been restricting competition. The crux of the discord, most likely, is that European regulators are telling US companies what to do \u2013 even if on European territory. Europe lacks equivalents to Big Tech The European Commission appears determined to keep enforcing its antitrust rules and the DMA. On March 19, 2025, it informed Alphabet that its preliminary assessment had shown that Google\u2019s behaviour in search and in the Google Play Store was incompatible with the DMA. Also, the first noncompliance decisions against Apple and Meta under the DMA are expected shortly \u2013 even though the fines may well stay below the maximum 10% of a company\u2019s global annual turnover allowed by the act, in view of its novelty. Europe is not an insignificant market for Google and other US tech companies. In 2024, Google reportedly generated 29% of its global revenue, or $100 billion , in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Europe has no equivalents to Google or other Big Tech companies, and the EU today imports 80% of its digital technology . In September 2024, the Draghi Report issued a stark warning to bloc leaders, highlighting waning geopolitical stability and the need for Europe to focus on closing the innovation gap with the US and China in advanced technologies. Less than five months later, the European Commission published the Competitiveness Compass , a roadmap to restoring Europe\u2019s dynamism and boosting economic growth. Strong measures from the White House in retaliation for European antitrust and regulatory enforcement might just give this process additional impetus. President Trump cannot make European tech great again, because it never was great. But his policies may unintentionally help make it so.

They care that it works and provides what they expect. They expect real-time updates, simple account management, and zero surprises. And public transit operators like you must adapt to meet these demands. That means fast, accurate, and intuitive tools that keep buses, trains, and riders moving. That\u2019s where a closed-loop automatic fare collection system can help you. Yet, choosing the wrong system can lead to unplanned delays, inconsistent experiences, and diminished trust in your services. To deliver a frictionless travel experience, it\u2019s crucial to focus on features that prioritize user convenience and accessibility. The right solution should do more than collect fares. It should streamline operations, protect revenue, and enhance rider experience without any complexity. In this blog, we break down five essential features every transit operator like you should look for when evaluating a closed-loop AFC system . These insights will help you make informed decisions th at align with your operational goals and enhance overall service quality. Why public transport needs smarter auto fare collection systems Modern public transit must balance operational efficiency with an exceptional rider experience. And increasingly, that balance depends on how fares are collected and managed. Balancing the 3Cs : Cost, control, and convenience In simple terms, automatic fare collection with closed-loop payments operates with transit fare cards or e-wallets. Unlike open-loop systems, which rely on bank-issued cards like Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc., these systems are managed by your transit agency. With a closed-loop payment system , businesses like yours can gain: Full control over fare structures, discounts, and exemptions The ability to retain more of the fare revenue by avoiding third-party processing fees Direct engagement with riders, independent of external card networks In short, it's a more sustainable and flexible model for businesses looking to modernize fare collection without sacrificing autonomy. Growing demand for seamless, digital transit experiences Consumer expectations are shaped by convenience and the experiences they get in different aspects of their lives. What tech giants like Amazon and Uber offer becomes a baseline. So it\u2019s not going to be any different for them when it comes to transit payments. Mobile-first and contactless interactions, instant account updates, and smooth transfers across services are now baseline expectations. And legacy fare systems? They simply weren\u2019t built for this. As transit networks grow more multimodal\u2014spanning buses, metro, trams, and ferries\u2014there\u2019s an urgent need for fare collection technology that keeps up with evolving rider behaviors. So what separates a good closed-loop AFC system from a great one? Let\u2019s look at the five must-have features. Real-Time Account Management and Stored Value A truly convenient closed-loop AFC system lets your passengers manage their fare wallet like any other digital account\u2014with instant access and full transparency. Here\u2019s what the systems should support: Preloading funds to a card or mobile account Real-time balance updates across all transit modes Auto top-ups, low balance alerts, and quick refunds Bonus: This approach also enables unbanked or underbanked people to use cashless automated fare collection systems through prepaid options. This makes public transit more accessible to everyone. Fare Flexibility with Smart Rules and Capping Fare rules shouldn\u2019t be locked into rigid structures. A robust closed-loop AFC system allows operators like you to configure fare logic that adapts to real-world travel patterns. Here are some key capabilities that you can prioritize: Zone-based, time-based, or distance-based pricing Daily, weekly, or monthly fare capping Seamless transfers between modes or agencies Ability to run promotions, off-peak discounts, and loyalty-based rewards This flexibility isn\u2019t just operationally smart; it builds rider trust by offering transparent pricing and tangible savings. Multimodal Integration and Interoperability Your customers shouldn\u2019t have to think about switching cards or apps when transferring from a bus to a train, or across regional lines. Closed-loop transit cards or e-wallets make it easier and seamless to pay the fare across different modes of transport within the same network. Closed-loop transit cards or e-wallets enable: Unified access across multiple modes: metro, tram, ferry, bus, etc. A single e-wallet or card that works system-wide Regional partnerships that make cross-jurisdiction travel seamless This level of integration is what transforms public transit into a true network, rather than a disconnected set of services. Mobile-First Access and Contactless Options We\u2019re well past the era where physical cards and vending machines were the norm. Smartphones are the default for making payments for most people now. This means that operators like you should go for a system that allows: Boarding via QR codes or NFC tap-to-pay from e-wallets Virtual transit cards stored in rider apps App or web access to trip history, reloads, and account settings It\u2019s not just about convenience. It\u2019s also about reducing reliance on hardware, which helps lower long-term costs for you. Rich Reporting and Operational Insights Automatic fare collection isn\u2019t just about moving money\u2014it\u2019s a source of valuable intelligence for decision-making. Your AFC system should provide: Real-time dashboards tracking boardings, trip duration, and fare types Historical trends to inform service adjustments Reporting by user groups (e.g., student riders, senior passes) By analyzing this data, transit companies like yours can optimize routes, staffing, and fare policies based on actual usage\u2014not assumptions. And with built-in tools to support promotions and loyalty rewards, you can run targeted campaigns to attract new riders or retain frequent ones. For example, bonus rides after 10 trips or discounts for early commuters can drive engagement and loyalty. The long-term advantage of a closed-loop fare collection system Short-term efficiency is important. But smart operators look ahead, and a closed-loop auto fare collection system offers more than just smoother payments. Cost savings and revenue control When you manage the fare ecosystem in-house, you bypass costly interchange fees and reduce reliance on payment processors. According to industry estimates, third-party card fees can eat up 2\u20133% of every fare. That is a silent but significant cost that closed-loop systems can eliminate. This also allows you to define fare exemptions, subsidy policies, and concession fares without interference from external institutions. Data ownership and security A closed-loop system means the data stays with you. Travel patterns, top-up behavior, fare category usage\u2014all of it can be stored securely, analyzed, and used to improve service. With better encryption and tighter system controls, the risk of breaches or fraud is also significantly lower than in open payment networks. Future-proofing for urban mobility The best closed-loop AFC platforms aren\u2019t just built for now; they\u2019re built for what\u2019s next. Whether it\u2019s integrating with bike-share programs, enabling smart city dashboards, or supporting real-time intermodal planning, these systems scale as your network grows. And as rider expectations continue to shift, systems that evolve alongside behavior will become your most strategic asset. Final words At its core, fare collection is about more than payments\u2014it\u2019s about how riders experience your system and how you, as an operator, shape that experience. Closed-loop payment system give you the strategic control to design smarter pricing, retain more revenue, and build deeper relationships with passengers. And they do it while reducing friction, lowering costs, and setting your network up for long-term success. So when you\u2019re evaluating AFC solutions, don\u2019t just check for compliance or compatibility. Ask: Does this system put us in control \u2014 and does it empower our riders? Does the system put you in charge? Does it anticipate future demands? Does it respect your bottom line? The answers will determine whether you\u2019re investing in a tool or a true partner for growth. External This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra.

Akshay Kumar , Ananya Panday , R Madhavan starrer 'Kesari: Chapter 2' is set to release in theatres on April 25.

The launch of Amazon Q Developer Pro Tier in the Frankfurt (eu-central-1) region marks a significant milestone for our European customers, addressing two critical needs: data residency and performance optimization. For organizations that need to meet EU data residency requirements, the ability to store customer content within EU boundaries can help provide the assurances they require. Beyond compliance, this regional presence brings performance benefits. European customers will experience reduced latency in their interactions with Amazon Q Developer, as requests are processed closer to home. This proximity not only improves response times but also enhances the overall development experience, making real-time interactions with Amazon Q Developer more fluid and natural. Amazon Q Developer Pro tier users now have the choice of creating a profile in N. Virginia (us-east-1) or Frankfurt (eu-central-1). Your content \u2013 including customizations \u2013 is stored in this region. While your content is stored in Frankfurt, Amazon Q utilizes cross-region inferencing to optimize request processing. At launch, this includes Frankfurt, Ireland, Paris and Stockholm, as shown in the following image. Finally, it is important to note that certain operations, such as querying AWS resources in other regions (e.g. \u201cList my S3 buckets in Tokyo\u201d), will naturally involve cross-region calls regardless of your Q Developer profile\u2019s location. The Frankfurt region includes all GA features except the command line and the ability to chat with Support . You can read more in the Amazon Q Developer User Guide . We invite you to experience these new capabilities by upgrading to the Pro tier and selecting Frankfurt as your region during profile creation. Get started with Amazon Q Developer , and share your feedback with us as we continue to expand our global presence.

It\u2019s a phrase middle managers use to talk about adapting to change in the workplace. Plus, the origin story of the name William , and why it\u2019s Guillermo in Spanish. And a five-year-old poses a question that puzzles a lot of people: Why is the letter Q so often followed by a U ? All that, and adynaton , an assonant quiz, do it up brown , salt of the earth , haven\u2019t grown gills yet , wooling , a silly joke about the number one, a poem about regret, and hide-and-seek calls, such as Ole Ole Olson all in free! This episode first aired June 12, 2021. It was rebroadcast the weekends of May 21, 2022, and April 13, 2025. https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/s.gum.fm/s-6335fc48c324eacdf1c68c6c/traffic.megaphone.fm/WAYW6538392079.mp3 When Pigs Fly and Las Vacas Vuelen In English, if we want to say that something will never occur, we say it\u2019ll happen when pigs fly or when hell freezes over . In Spanish, you can express this idea by saying it will happen \u201cwhen cows fly,\u201d or el d\u00eda que las vacas vuelen . In Italian, the same idea is reflected in a phrase that translates as \u201cwhen donkeys fly.\u201d In Malay, that event will occur \u201cwhen cats grow horns,\u201d in French \u201cwhen chickens have teeth,\u201d and in Bulgarian \u201cwhen the pig in yellow slippers climbs the pear tree.\u201d This rhetorical device is called an adynaton , from a Greek word that means \u201cimpossible.\u201d Haven\u2019t Grown Gills Yet Kamela works as a nurse in Anchorage, Alaska. When she asked a patient how how he was doing post-surgery, the man responded with Well, I haven\u2019t grown gills yet . It\u2019s a jocular way of acknowledging that although he hadn\u2019t recovered completely, things could definitely be worse. More Impossible Events Two examples of adynaton, the rhetorical term for playful exaggeration suggesting that something will never happen, involve animals\u2019 tails. One German expression translates as \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when the hounds start barking with their tail,\u201d and a Latvian one translates as \u201cIt\u2019ll happen when an owl\u2019s tail blooms.\u201d The Business Expression \u201cMoving Someone\u2019s Cheese\u201d Alyssa from Dallas, Texas, is puzzled by some jargon she hears in her workplace. As a management consultant, she\u2019s often warned by her bosses to make sure that employees don\u2019t think that management is moving their cheese. The phrase references Spencer Johnson\u2019s 1998 bestseller, Who Moved My Cheese? ( Bookshop | Amazon ) This motivational fable is the story of two mice and two tiny humans caught in a maze, and how they adapt \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 when their usual food source is moved to another location. Making One Disappear How do you make the number one disappear? Hint: add a letter. Two-Word A Puzzle All the answers to this puzzle from Quiz Guy John Chaneski are two-word phrases, and the only vowel they contain is the letter A . For example, suppose John is lounging in a shaded spot where only one variety of fruit is allowed. Where is he? How Are \u201cWilliam\u201d and \u201cGuillermo\u201d Related? Justin in Dallas, Texas, is curious about the origin of the name William , and why the Spanish version is Guillermo . Its popularity goes back to the days of William the Conqueror. Modern languages have several versions of this name, such as German Wilhelm and Dutch Willem. For a good explanation of the phonetic changes that led to these different versions, check out Trask\u2019s Historical Linguistics by R. L. Trask, revised and edited by Robert McColl Miller. ( Bookshop | Amazon ) W.H. Auden\u2019s \u201cAs I Walked Out One Evening\u201d H. Auden\u2019s poem \u201cAs I Walked Out One Evening\u201d contains some lovely examples of the rhetorical device called adynaton, which are impossible things, including: I\u2019ll love you, dear, I\u2019ll love you / Till China and Africa meet, / And the river jumps over the mountain / And the salmon sing in the street . Do It Up Brown The phrase do it up brown can have two very different meanings: to \u201cdo something to perfection,\u201d as in something that is perfectly cooked, and \u201cto swindle\u201d someone or beat them at their own game \u2014 metaphorically leaving them \u201ccooked.\u201d Salting the Earth vs. Salt of the Earth The phrase salt of the earth describes someone who is essential and pure of heart, a reference to the biblical Sermon on the Mount. To salt the earth usually means to render the ground useless, whether metaphorically or literally. David Ray\u2019s Poem, \u201cThanks, Robert Frost\u201d Following up on our discussion about the many meanings of the word regret , we share David Ray\u2019s poem \u201cThanks, Robert Frost,\u201d which addresses hope for the past as well as hope for the future. This poem was read with permission of the author . All Out Are in Free Hide-and-Seek Call Kit from Pulaski, Tennessee, recalls that when he played hide-and-seek as a youngster in Miami, Florida, the call he and his friends used at the end of the game to draw everyone out of hiding was All y\u2019all come in free! . However, he\u2019s aware of other versions and wonders if they\u2019re all variations of one original phrase. There\u2019s no written record of an original version, and since this phrase tends to get passed along more often by word of mouth more than in written form, it can be highly variable. The Dictionary of American Regional English lists dozens of versions, including Ole Ole Olson all in free and all-ee all-ee ump free and all home free . Adynaton Origin and Meaning The word adynaton , which refers to a jocular phrase that emphasizes the idea of impossibility, was adopted into English from Greek, where adynaton means \u201cimpossible,\u201d a combination of a- meaning \u201cnot\u201d and dynatos , which means \u201cpossible.\u201d This Greek word derives from a root that means \u201cto have power,\u201d the source also of the English word dynamic . One Hungarian adynaton translates as \u201cwhen it\u2019s snowing red.\u201d A Russian version translates as \u201cwhen a crayfish whistles on top of a mountain.\u201d In Serbian and Croatian, the same idea is expressed by a phrase rendered in English as \u201cwhen grapes grow on willow.\u201d The Roman poet Virgil expressed the idea of something doubly improbable with the idea of \u201cwhen golden apples grow on oak trees.\u201d Stop Wooling Me! Tabitha from Palmer, Alaska, remembers her mother used to exclaim Stop wooling me! , a phrase used in parts of Appalachia, the Southeast US, and the Ozarks to mean \u201cstop bothering me,\u201d \u201cstop roughhousing,\u201d or \u201cstop tussling.\u201d Why is Q Followed by U? Quinn from Excelsior, Minnesota, is five years old \u2014 well, five and three-quarters, as she points out. She wonders why the letter Q is so often followed by U . In Old English, the alphabet didn\u2019t include the letter Q. The word quick , for example, was spelled cwic . The QU combination was introduced as a result of the Norman invasion, when many French words and language custom reflected the influence of Latin and helped create modern English. Latin, in turn, had been influenced by the Etruscans, whose alphabet included the letter qoppa . Two wonderful books about the evolution of the letters we use today are Letter Perfect by David Sacks ( Bookshop | Amazon ) and Michael Rosen\u2019s Alphabetical: How Every Letter Tells a Story ( Bookshop | Amazon ). This episode is hosted by Martha Barnette and Grant Barrett, and produced by Stefanie Levine.

Associated Tim Mc @ XTAR direct on 14/04/2025 - 20:38 XTAR direct is legit. I've ordered the SC1 Plus from them before in 2023. I bought an XTAR VP2 back in 2014, PB2S and VC8 around 2022 from other stores. Then I reviewed the VC2L, VC8S, SC1 Plus, MX4, and VX4. adventurer on 14/04/2025 - 23:01 The problem with this is the 1A limit. I have tested this VC4 charging Eneloops. Sadly this charger is actually slower than Eneloop fast charger. tunzafun001 on 15/04/2025 - 09:51 And doesn't do LiFePo4.

Granted it is double the price, but I figured worth it since it is more stable on power supply (dedicated AC/DC adapter) as opposed to the USB cable this VC4 relies on. If you are looking for portability this VC4 is a great charger especially for this price. yangguchunyang7612 on 15/04/2025 - 14:37 Had one high end charger from this brand and experience was terrible. The battery (fully compatible with what they advertised) was charged for few hours and wouldn't stop, i can hear some abnormal sound coming from insidce of battery and i feel it's going to explode wtf Lps on 15/04/2025 - 16:17 yeh, wtf Login or Join to leave a comment Login Join Related Products XTAR VC4 by XTAR Top Deals Active or upcoming Electrical & Electronics deals from the last 30 days.

It has 6 cores and is weaker than even a 12700k with 12 cores. If you are on AM5 platform, the 9600X is more efficient with not much more money. 9700K is obviously better if you can afford it. But to get better performance than the 245K in gaming, you really need to spend more for the 7800X3D or 9800X3D. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 2 Replies myanth 6h ago Apr 15, 2025 12:19 AM 29 Posts Joined Aug 2011 6h ago Apr 15, 2025 12:19 AM myanth 6h ago Apr 15, 2025 12:19 AM 29 Posts Quote from Drifta : 7600 is outdated at this point.

It has 6 cores and is weaker than even a 12700k with 12 cores. If you are on AM5 platform, the 9600X is more efficient with not much more money. 9700K is obviously better if you can afford it. But to get better performance than the 245K in gaming, you really need to spend more for the 7800X3D or 9800X3D. there is no 9700K, unless from Intel lol I would get the Intel and not bother with motherboard upgrades Or get an 8 core Ryzen and do the same Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Related Searches Computers Computer Parts CPUs Free Shipping Online Only Act Fast Intel See More $4.32 $15 71% off 13.5\" One Bite Stainless-Steel Rocking-Style Pizza Cutter w/ Wood Handle $4.32 + Free S&H w/ Walmart+ or on $35+ 8 There is no voting data on this thread You have chosen to downvote this deal.

Needed a data drive for video editing to put in the internal slot of the dock I got for my M4 Pro Mac Mini, this should do just fine. Since it doesn't get as hot as the Pro version, seems like a perfect fit in the enclosure, and at only $6 more than what Crucial offers ( https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pl...1_3?sr=8-3 ), it's also faster. I've come to trust Samsung SSD drives more than other brands. I have a few that have lasted more than a decade and don't show signs of slowing down. Of course read/writes make a big difference, but still, I've had other drives from Team, Edge, etc. that have failed in less than 2 years.

Despite hopes for deregulation, Trump\u2019s appointees remain committed to scrutinising tech giants. AI companies like Nvidia and Microsoft are also under investigation. Navbharat Times The Trump administration isn't letting up on the tech giants. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission will face off with Meta in court over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. And on April 21, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should force Google to sell its Chrome web browser to limit the power of its search monopoly. Both cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Donald Trump's first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google's ad technology business. Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and setting proactive regulations for tech. But so far, Trump's appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry's hopes. Live Events \"I think that they may not have fully focused on how much the first Trump presidency had to do with setting in motion this reexamination of tech ,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Here's what to know. Who is in charge of antitrust enforcement now? Trump appointed Andrew Ferguson as chair of the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints. \"I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we've got going,\" Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast \"Odd Lots\" this year. The new leader of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Gail Slater, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Trump's first term. She has also pledged to enforce antitrust laws aggressively. \"It's now a bipartisan issue, and there's a consensus around the need for robust antitrust enforcement,\" Slater said at an event hosted this month by Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup accelerator, which has pushed for more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. Where do the major antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants stand? Five government cases accuse tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies, and all are moving through the courts. The companies deny the allegations. The FTC sued Meta in 2020, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 violated the law by using what regulators call a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate its nascent rivals. The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The Justice Department sued Google in 2020 over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a roughly three-week hearing on how to address Google's monopoly. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal. The Justice Department accused Google in 2023 of illegally dominating the advertising technology business. A federal judge heard arguments in that case last year, and a ruling is expected soon. The FTC accused Amazon in a 2023 lawsuit of squeezing small merchants that use its marketplace to sell to consumers. A federal judge rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case last year. It is scheduled to go to trial next year. The Justice Department sued Apple last year over claims that the company's interwoven ecosystem of technology makes it hard for consumers to ditch their iPhones and iPads . Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. What about tech industry mergers and acquisitions? The Biden administration tried and failed to block numerous tech deals, including Meta's purchase of a small virtual reality startup, Within. The push to stop acquisitions outraged investors who back small companies that want to cash out by being acquired by a tech giant. Trump's appointees say they want to get out of the way of acquisitions that don't present a competitive problem. Slater has expressed an openness to companies' proposing settlements -- such as selling off similar assets -- which can help resolve concerns about deals. In late January, the Justice Department sued to block the business software company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper Networks, a networking firm, for $14 billion. It was the first lawsuit to challenge a tech deal in Trump's second term. During the first Trump administration, the Justice Department unsuccessfully challenged AT&T's purchase of Time Warner. What does this mean for the artificial intelligence race? Last year, the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide up responsibility for investigating whether the biggest players in artificial intelligence were violating antitrust laws. The Justice Department started investigating Nvidia , while the FTC took Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI. It is unclear whether those investigations will result in lawsuits. The Trump administration has promised to clear the way for American companies to develop AI, including rescinding a Biden-era executive order that put guardrails on the use of the technology. The administration has solicited the industry's input on how best to move forward with policy around the technology, an opening that companies and investors took to lobby for fewer rules. \"I think it is extremely important that we protect competition in the AI space, but I think it is equally important that the government not race to regulate AI,\" Ferguson said on Bloomberg TV in March.

The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8.30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. - 'Inspiration' - Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy\", whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams\". \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl\", will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission.

Sounds like two issues to me, neither one being this extension. First, flat head screws are a pain, even when un/screwing straight without an extension/adapter. You really have to get the right sized flat head, and even then you'll have issues. Second issue could be if the flat head bit isn't of good quality. If the issue were this extension, it would most likely break apart itself, not the tip. A torx but would probably fare better, especially if the bit itself were impact rated. I could be wrong, but I've stripped the heads of a few flat and Phillips head screws and bits in my day. Hex and torx, I mostly lost, lol. 6 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Old_Snake308 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 10:47 AM 459 Posts Joined Nov 2009 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 10:47 AM Old_Snake308 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 10:47 AM 459 Posts Imo this is a tool to use when you actually need the pivot function, not an extension to leave on your driver full time. The mechanism has a lot of play even when locked so it doesn't mesh that well with the fastener. 4 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Taco 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 11:39 AM 846 Posts Joined Oct 2003 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 11:39 AM Taco 2d ago Apr 13, 2025 11:39 AM 846 Posts I use it more than I thought I would.

The holder is impact rated, but there's a chance the tip is not. If you want good impact rated tips, go with Bosch. However, nobody uses flat head screws if they can avoid them. I don't even think they make them hard enough to need an impact. And you certainly don't need that much driving force for dining chairs. 3 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link boriskey Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 5:21 PM 592 Posts Joined Jun 2007 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 5:21 PM boriskey Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 5:21 PM 592 Posts returned mine, it is too flimsy for any practical use 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link smartt Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:12 PM 2,724 Posts Joined Nov 2010 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:12 PM smartt Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:12 PM 2,724 Posts I'm such a sucker for these tools accessories.

Hiking Over 60: A New Book by Philip Werner Philip Werner April 14, 2025 Blog My new book \u201c Hiking Over 60: A Modern Guide to Hiking Gear and Techniques for Active Adults \u201d is out and free on Amazon today. It\u2019s a book for new hikers as well as more experienced ones who want to come up to speed on the lightweight hiking gear revolution that has occurred in the past 10 years. Gone are the days when you had to carry a crushing weight to go hiking or use heavy leather boots that felt like you were wearing cinder blocks on your feet. Hiking gear, clothing, tools, and techniques are much lighter weight and simpler than they used to be, making hiking more accessible than ever for mature hikers. Hiking is also very budget friendly, since you can get started with a pair of sneakers you already own and hiking is free in most local or state parks, conservation areas, and national forests. In addition to its physical benefits including better weight control, aerobic health, and enhanced muscle strength, hiking has mental and social benefits that become increasingly important as we age. Hiking gets you of the house and away from your TV, computer, phone and the constant interruptions we all experience in the \u201cattention\u201d economy. It also strengthens your social connections which can be difficult to maintain, but are so important when we get older. Hiking is a great way to expand your social circle with people from all walks of life, and to maintain your ties to family and friends. Hiking Over 60 is divided into two parts. Part 1 \u2013 Hiking Fundamentals covers the basic skills you need to plan a hike, use a map, choose hiking footwear and clothing, pack food and water, and how to go to the bathroom outside. Hiking safety is also addressed including blister prevention and treatment, how to pack a first aid kit, and who to call in an emergency using conventional means like a cell phone or a satellite messenger. Part 2 \u2013 Hiking Gear Guide goes into much more depth about hiking footwear, clothes and layering, how to use trekking poles, what to look for when choosing a backpack, hydration and water filtering, GPS navigation apps and devices, and satellite communicators. There\u2019s also a section on medical support gear including leg braces, compression sleeves, and straps to minimize pain and keep older hikers on the trail longer. Hiking Over 60 includes hiking gear recommendations throughout the book based on my experience reviewing hundred and hundreds of hiking and backpacking gear products on my website, SectionHiker.com . My goal there and in Hiking Over 60 has always been to help people understand what is real and what is BS when it come to penetrating the wild claims made by many hiking and clothing manufacturers. I\u2019m also a pretty frugal guy by nature, so if I recommend gear or clothing, you can rest assured that its the real deal. So, if you\u2019re like me and over 60 years of age, I hope you find Hiking Over 60 enlightening and useful. In the words of one of my readers, \u201cage is no barrier to hiking.\u201d You can do it if you try, and I hope that my guidance will speed you on your journey. Hiking Over 60 is currently available on Amazon as an eBook. A paperback version is in the pipeline and should be available next month.

Reply Jesse April 14, 2025 at 3:46 pm Description makes it sound like it\u2019s a very general hiking guide book, but the title makes it sound like it\u2019s specifically aimed for older readers. Which is closer to truth? Got the ebook, but I think this question might be on others mind as well and thus worth asking in public. Reply Philip Werner April 14, 2025 at 7:24 pm Both. There\u2019s no doubt that anyone would benefit from reading it. It\u2019s quite loaded with relevant information that any hiker or backpacker needs to know. But it\u2019s written for a specific audience. No doubt about it. A lot of people over 60 don\u2019t know how much the hiking world, culture, and gear has changed in the past 20 years. This brings them up to date. Reply Rob Z April 14, 2025 at 6:59 pm Thanks! Just downloaded a copy, will leave a review. Reply Philip Werner April 14, 2025 at 7:27 pm Thanks Rob.

Transcript of Interview with Tara Cremin Joanna: Tara Cremin is the director of Kobo Writing Life, Kobo's independent publishing platform. Welcome back to the show, Tara. Tara: Thanks, Jo. Thanks for having me. Joanna: Oh, it is great to have you back on the show. It's actually been four years, which is crazy. Tara: I can't believe it. Joanna: I know. So I thought we'd go back to the beginning. Tell us a bit more about you. When did you get into the book business, and what are some of the changes you've seen for authors since then? Tara: Sure. So I've been working for Kobo since 2012, which feels like a lifetime. When I started, the company had created some great, but kind of relatively simple, eReaders. They were just starting to dip their toe into really expanding what physical devices could do. Then you fast forward to 2025, and we're the second largest manufacturer of eReaders , after our friends in Seattle. So part of the work that I do on Kobo Writing Life, I've been working on it basically since day one. Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform for authors who wanted to publish directly to Kobo readers. So I've been kind of working on that. The biggest change on the author side that I can really think of is just the expansion of the tools. I think it's easy to not always think back to 2012 because things move so quickly. I'll be like, \u201cOh, that was ages ago,\u201d but it'll be like four years ago. When you're actually thinking about 2012, authors were uploading a Word doc and publishing their ebook, and then that was it. There wasn't a lot of different things available or more opportunities. Now, authors can really easily create accessible and like really beautifully designed ePubs with tools like Vellum and Atticus . They can publish audiobooks to Kobo, they can reach libraries, join subscription programs, and take advantage of all the promotional tools that are available. So I think the biggest change is just that there's more opportunities now for authors than when I started working in the book business. Joanna: Oh, and\u2014 What about the growth of Kobo for indies? I mean, we've heard before some of the stats around the number of self-published books on the Kobo platform. That's grown as well, hasn't it? Tara: It has. I have some stats for you. When we look at self-publishing on Kobo, it makes up about 25% of the units for single copy sales . Then if we think about the subscription reading, it makes up about 60% of English language subscription reading is all self-published content. It's huge . Joanna: Wow, that's incredible. So indie authors are important to Kobo, I guess we could say. Tara: Yes, and it started with somebody wanting to email a Word doc and get it published, which is why Kobo Writing Life was created as a platform. We've really been able to expand it and add additional features. Kobo has always taken a global stance of the digital book market, and I think we realized pretty early that the indie authors were really integral to that. Something that I don't think we talk about a lot because I'm primarily focused on the English language side, but we also have a portal that's just for users in Japan that's very self-contained in Japanese. Last year, we actually localized in traditional and simplified Chinese for our friends in Taiwan and Hong Kong. So the Kobo Writing Life platform is now available in eight languages. So we know how integral the independent authors are to the global book business. Joanna: Kobo originally was Canadian, right? Then it was bought by a Japanese company. Tara: Yes, so we're still headquartered in Toronto. We have a global presence, where we have offices in Taiwan, in Tokyo, Darmstadt and Dublin, and with a generous sprinkling of people throughout Europe. We were acquired by Rakuten, maybe prior to me joining, 2010, 2011, and we've been sort of their digital book area of that ever since then. So having this enormous company backing has been really, really helpful, but we do maintain quite a Canadian-centric grassroots focus with the HQ being here in Toronto . Joanna: Absolutely. So one of the changes you mentioned has been the subscription model. As you mentioned, our friends in Seattle have one that's quite famous that is an exclusive program. Kobo Plus is not exclusive, so people can be in that as well as selling their ebooks elsewhere, which I love. How does Kobo Plus subscription compare to some of the other subscription models for ebooks and audiobooks? Like, what is it for readers and listeners? Tara: Sure, I think it's maybe important to see why people have gone down the subscription route, for people that are potentially a little bit hesitant of that. So when we're thinking about the book business as a whole, or Kobo's history, I think in about 2015 we could see that there was a whole generation of consumers that were coming that were consuming most of their media by not purchasing it once at a time, and they were signing up for subscriptions . Whether this be music or movies or TV shows, I think we knew that books and audiobooks were going to go this way. As a retailer that was really doing a great job at selling books one at a time, we wanted to reach this subscription consumer without disrupting the business we had built and doing it in a way that benefited us, the publishers, the authors, but also the readers who were looking for this. So we tested this in a contained market. So it was launched back in 2017 in the Netherlands. This is because we had a really great market share there. A strong, willing partner, Bol, who wanted to test this out. One of the also key factors was that there's some of the biggest piracy rates in Europe were found in the Netherlands. So we wanted to see if we could convert those users who were already sometimes using Kobo devices. They're reading, they're just not paying for the reading. So we wanted to see if we could make this very easy, self-contained platform, could we convert them to paying users? Then what we found from that is that it really didn't cannibalize the a la carte sales. We had new customers signing up, and we could kind of see where they were coming from. Some of them were coming over from Kindle Unlimited, some of them coming from piracy. Some of them had been maybe just library users that had been moved into this kind of easier one click model. Some of them had never read an ebook before, but used it as a way to step their toe into the digital reading. What we found is that \u2014 Publishers and authors, they all earned more as a result of the new readers [on subscription]. So what we looked at with these findings was\u2014gosh, it'll be almost 10 years now, which is wild. Time doesn't exist anymore, Joanna\u2014but with the findings from the Netherlands, we've been able to expand Kobo Plus. As of this recording, we are currently in 23 countries , which is including all of our core markets. There'll be more to come, probably shortly after this comes out, actually, but I can't quite say where. So 23 countries right now. Like you've mentioned, we're not the only subscription model out there, but what makes us a little bit different is the focus on the importance of the authors and wanting to give them flexibility, while also trying to reach this subscription reader. So it was really important to us that we didn't lock any authors into exclusivity. Our ethos around KWL is really trying to encourage authors to publish widely on as many platforms as they can, to reach as many readers as they can. We just want to make sure that the Kobo experience of you publishing widely is really easy and that you're not spending too much time on it because you're balancing all of these other platforms. So we built this out so authors can pick and choose the country. They can choose all of them if they want, which is what I would always recommend. If you're a wide author that's publishing globally, I don't know why you wouldn't put your books in, but perhaps you didn't want to hit up your main markets, like the US or Canada. You do have the option of like excluding those, or you can select all of them. What's a cool way about selecting all of them is that it actually includes future territories. So as we've been rapidly expanding Kobo Plus, you don't have to do anything. Your books are already there when we add to new places. So that's been pretty cool. We're not locking authors into any timed period. You can put your books in, and you can take them out if you're not happy with it. I always encourage people to leave them in, to really try to reach that readership. Again, we wanted to give authors as much control as possible, and really just get authors to try it out. Like try out an older series, maybe try it out in the Netherlands, where you haven't really thought about selling books before, and eventually get really comfortable adding their catalog to Kobo plus. So for us, it was really all about building author trust over time when it comes to subscriptions . I feel people are more comfortable with it now than before, and I think it's easy to get people comfortable when the revenue is increasing, I think. Joanna: So all my books that are on Kobo are in Kobo Plus . I also agree, I think there's a group of readers for whom\u2014readers and listeners, we should say\u2014because this is audiobooks as well, right? Tara: Yes, it is. Depending on the territory, but primarily they all have ebooks and audiobooks. So from a customer perspective, you can either pay for all you can read for a month, all you can listen for a month, or all you can read and listen. So those are the options. Joanna: Exactly. So this is the thing, I think as authors, we have to think about different groups of readers. So even as we record this, I've got a Kickstarter happening. There is an ebook, there is an audiobook, which will eventually be on Kobo, but for now, they're just on Kickstarter. Then there's a gorgeous hardback with foil and ribbon and all of that kind of thing, which Kobo doesn't sell beautiful hardbacks, right? I mean, and neither does Amazon, neither does Apple. [The special hardback vs subscription.] They're different audiences. It's a completely different audience, someone who's going to buy that hardback to someone who's going to borrow the audiobook in the Netherlands. Tara: Yes. I mean, I love seeing what authors are doing with these. That must be so satisfying for you to get that copy of this beautiful book. So, yes, we really wanted to just focus on the digital experience, especially when it comes to our devices as well. We make some of the best e-reading devices\u2014I mean, I would say they are the best\u2014but like, we're making the best eReaders that are available. We launched our first color eReaders last year, and the reception to them was just tremendous. So our eReaders have integration with ebooks and audiobooks . You can connect via Bluetooth to speakers or headphones. We also have Overdrive capabilities, like Overdrive is built into the e reader, so you can access the library from within Kobo. One of the things that we've been doing, l think we've just launched it maybe last year. You can tell I don't work on the device side, I'm not quite as sharp with my dates. It's always been very important for us to have it be this open platform. So having users be able to just use the eReader to read books, and if we can make it easy for them to purchase books with subscriptions and convert them to paying users, that's awesome, but we do have integration with Dropbox. With our newer eReaders, you can actually write notes with the Kobo Stylist, and you can mark up the files themselves, and there's integration within that. We've recently added Google Drive integration, which is super easy. I just used it the other day when I was giving a presentation, and I had my notes that I was able to convert over and read from my Kobo, which was really helpful. I was actually able to mark up and make changes as I'm going along on the Kobo eReader itself, which is pretty cool. Joanna: Of course, if people buy my ebook from the Kickstarter, they can read that on Kobo because it doesn't have to be like DRMed into \u2014that's too technical. It doesn't have to be a specifically Kobo ebook is what you're saying. Tara: No, no, no. We always just use the ePub standard. Actually, I shouldn't be saying that because you can also add PDFs and things like that. So, no, it's not a locked system. Joanna: I think that's really good too. So let's get into some of the other things. I mean, like we mentioned, the gorgeous hardbacks that are the current trend in the indie community. I mean, they really are kind of all people are talking about. You and I were talking about doing this episode because at the end of the day \u2014 The bread and butter income for most indie authors is still digital. It's like, we move on to the sexiest thing. In 2012 ebooks were pretty sexy, right? I mean, they were like, \u201cOh, we can do this, and we can do this.\u201d Then it was audiobooks and print-on-demand and all of that, and now it's gorgeous hardbacks. So let's just go back in to the sort of bread and butter. What are your tips for maximizing income from ebooks and audiobooks on Kobo? I know that's a massive question, but let's pick a few things. Tara: I think it's still really important to make beautiful books, even if it's digital . I mean because authors are primarily digital first. A lot of publishers are not. They're still really focused on the print. So I think it's really important to think about making a really great digital file, which, like I mentioned, it's just easier than ever now. You actually don't even have to think about it that much, the tools just do it for you. I think it's important to have a file that can be read easily because the last thing we want to do is have some sort of technical glitch that is interrupting somebody's hard won reading time. We really just want the person to be always trying to get the next book, so making sure the file itself is beautiful and working perfectly, I think is really important. I think it's important to consider making accessible files so that everyone can read your book . Digital reading opens up a world to people that might have limitations around physical book reading. There are a number of people that can only read digitally, and it just allows for a more inclusive reading experience. So something to be mindful of as well. Joanna: Just on that\u2014 Is there something special we need to do for accessibility for an ebook? Tara: So I have a book recommendation for everyone called Content For Everyone , by Jeff Adams and Michele Lucchini. We had them on the Kobo Writing Life Podcast, and it was just a great conversation. I would say to check out their book because it has a lot of practical advice for authors on making accessible content. So not even just the ebooks themselves, but also author websites and newsletters. It's really full of actionable tips. They are far more versed in this than I would be to try and reiterate some of their stuff. Joanna: Jeff's been on this show, and we talked about it then . I got the impression that if you use, let's say, Vellum or Atticus for your ebook publishing, that does cover the content, at least, of an ebook. Tara: Yes, yes, perfect. Joanna: Okay, great. So just to be clear, there wasn't anything extra we were missing. Tara: No, no. Just to make sure that that is kind of being done, and you're not creating files that are inaccessible. Joanna: Which, to me, it means that Kobo is still getting a ton of badly formatted files, which I thought we were way past that. Tara: It's not that it's badly formatted, I think you have to consider the millions of books that exist, and especially the older catalog. So newer books might be accessible, but the older books that you've created back in 2012 might not be. So a lot of the work we're doing is just an education around making sure that your book files are of the best content or the best quality that they can be, like before vellum existed. Joanna: Oh, yes. I used to use Scrivener back in the day. I know some people still do, but Scrivener, I used to get errors all the time. I love Scrivener for writing, but for listeners, I would say Vellum or Atticus is the best in class these days. Okay, back on to maximizing income. Tara: So I would say that \u2014 For Kobo, box sets are super popular. So when you're thinking about selling books one at a time, and authors primarily are writing in series, or that's sort of the trend that we see through Kobo Writing Life, you definitely want to bundle your books. Something to remember is that on Kobo, we don't have a higher price cap . So you can go over $9.99, and still earn 70% on each sale. So with the box sets, again, you want to make sure that you have an easy to navigate table of contents because this is a larger file that readers are browsing through. So you want to make sure that they're able to do that with ease. Which I'm sure, again, these tools can kind of easily create this for you, but just something to be mindful of when you're bundling the books together. Joanna: Yes. I think bringing up box sets is really good because the KWL promotion tab i s great. I go in every three weeks, and I apply for as much as I can get. Although, just so everyone knows, I don't get every promotion. Like nobody gets every promotion, right? You just have to apply for a ton of them. There are always box set promotions going on. Tara: Yes, we rotate around pretty regularly with them because our readers are just so interested in having box sets. It's funny because I think we think about box sets as like a discounted opportunity to have these books, but that's not really how readers are taking them. They're taking them as like this is a convenient way to have this one series in this one book . So I'd always recommend pricing them for their value and just making sure that they're available for the reader who doesn't want to like click on books one by one, and just have this bigger box set. Something to keep in mind with the covers is that we do accept the 3D box sets with the plain white backgrounds, but if you're thinking about promotions or applying to promotions, we might be a little bit less inclined to accept those, just because it makes your cover really small and it makes it harder to read. You already have limited space on a website in terms of a cover, so I really like to \u2014 Think of box set covers as they're almost as an ad for your series. So you can kind of use it as an opportunity to encapsulate the theme of your series within your box set cover. Joanna: Then just on that, just on Kobo Plus, we didn't say\u2014So a lot of authors are used to the \u2018pages read' idea. How is that done on Kobo Plus for reading and listening? Tara: The biggest difference, I guess, between Kobo Plus and some of the other platforms is that we base our payment on\u2014well, it's a very similar revenue share model\u2014but it's based on the minutes that your book has been read versus the page reads. This allows us to treat ebooks and audiobooks the same, and it kind of reduces a little bit of the gamification that we've seen on some other platforms . So we're really taking into account the time that somebody is spending on your book. Joanna: Yes, because some people were able to game other systems by sort of getting bots or paying people to click through pages and stuff like that. Oh, but it's funny, isn't it? I mean, whenever humans can find a way to game a system, they will. Tara: We're very clever people. Joanna: We are. We are very clever people. Okay, so\u2014 What about some other ways of maximizing income? Tara: So I would say with audiobooks that we're talking about, so you can publish audiobooks to Kobo as well, through Kobo Writing Life. You may not see the tab right away, and actually the same with the promotions tab, but you just have to send the team an email to enable this for you. If you email writinglife@kobo.com you can ask for audiobooks and for promotions. Just as we were talking about the box set covers there, I think something to keep in mind with audiobooks, we will crop the cover for you. If you want to make sure that you're making the best cover, audiobooks are square and not rectangular, so sometimes we do see kind of like a really squished cover. That would just be something to be a bit mindful of when you're publishing audiobooks, to just make sure that you're selling the book because we are unfortunately always judging books by their covers. Joanna: Yes, absolutely. I guess\u2014 One of the things I've noticed with Kobo is that the vast majority of my Kobo income is fiction rather than nonfiction. Is there a split like that? Tara: There probably is, but I feel like the nonfiction market for us is definitely growing, especially with our new devices. We've done a lot of work to try to cater to the nonfiction reader, and what we call like an immersive reading experience. You can see this with the writing within the book itself. There's easy ways to flip back and forth between the pages. We basically have the digital version of like a thumb in the side of the pages, so you don't lose your spot, but you can actually flip through the book and then flip back again. So it's definitely growing, but I think what we see, especially on Kobo Writing Life, it would be fiction that would be primarily what people are reading right now . Joanna: Well, I'll put another sort of ask in for the promotional tab, which is mainly fiction focused, I find. I do always look for nonfiction promotions there. To be clear, again, for people listening, I do think to sell books on Kobo, it is good to be part of the promotional opportunities . You can really get in front of new readers that way. So that would be one of the things I would like to see, is more nonfiction and memoir promotional opportunities. Tara: For sure. I will take this to the team. Joanna: Yes. Take the feedback! Let's talk about libraries because some authors are worried about libraries. I mean, obviously authors want libraries to have their ebooks and audiobooks, but they're also worried about the money. If an author goes with the library and Overdrive, how do they get paid for that? Tara: So it's really easy to opt your books in. It's part of the publication process, so it's in the rights and distribution section. So you just have to set a price in USD, and that'll be your library price for the book . The general rule of thumb is roughly around the same as a mass market paperback. You just want to make sure that you're not putting the same price as your just straight up digital book because of the loaning factor when it comes to the library books. Sometimes we have authors that want to appeal to libraries by putting it in at a lower price, and I always kind of remind them that the librarians have two ways of purchasing the books through Kobo Writing Life. So they can publish on a one copy, one user. This is kind of like when you think of a traditional book, that we have this one book and that can be loaned out multiple times. So that's why you want to increase the price because you want to cover the loans that are happening with that. They also have the opportunity to buy your book on a cost per checkout option, and that's for a one-time loan for 10% of the price. So if your library book is $19.99, they could also just buy your book for a one-time loan for $1.99. So that can really appeal to them. We have a lot of the library sales that are demand driven, so it's people actually going in and asking for your book. So it's really great to be able to offer to a librarian, like actually, you can buy it just this one time, and maybe you'll buy it a few times for the lower price. Then if it's really popular, then you'll buy it for the higher price again. So we see that happening quite a lot. Authors that distribute to Overdrive through Kobo, they earn 50% of any sale that happens. Joanna: Yes. So just to put people's mind at ease \u2014 You can support libraries and get paid. So this is one of the ways you can say to people, you can listen or read my books for free. Just ask the librarian to stock them, or just go to your library app. I think that's a good one. I wanted to come on to the authors who do really well on KWL. What are the commonalities that you see amongst top selling authors? What do you see working that we can model? Tara: Well, like you've mentioned, the promotions tool that we have. I was trying to think about instances of authors that have moved widely in the past couple of years and are finding success on Kobo, and they're honestly the ones that have leveraged their promotions. It can take a little while to build a Kobo audience , and I just always recommend applying to the promotions that are relevant to your books and applying regularly. I like to think about it as, like, the worst case scenario is that you're putting your books in front of the right eyes. It can just be quite competitive because there's a lot of people applying, but it's our merchandising team that are going through them. So I definitely would say the ones that are building the audience and finding success on Kobo are really leveraging the promotions with us. Then also, that's audio and library promotions that we have too. I think if you're publishing audiobooks, and I know this can be really tricky to balance, but if you can make sure that you're publishing your ebook and your audiobook on the same day and do those same releases, I think that's really important to building sales. We found authors that have kind of reported that it's a bigger impact for their audio when they do that versus when they release it at a later date or anything. So you can try and line them up as the one book release. Joanna: Well, then that brings me on to something, having obviously done audiobooks for many years. Sometimes I narrate them myself, sometimes I have paid people, but recently, and in fact, my Death Valley audiobook \u2014I haven't told you this\u2014but it is narrated by my voice clone, my AI voice clone . Today, as we record this, I put a couple of chapters up on The Creative Penn Podcast, so people can have a listen. I've already had comments that say, \u201cI would not have known this was an AI. It sounds exactly like you.\u201d This will be, I think, the first time in however long I've been doing this now, 2007, I've been able to publish ebook and audiobook on the same day. Tara: Oh, wow. Joanna: Because, as you said, it is incredibly hard to do that because most of us, in the past, we've maybe sold the ebook first, made some money, then eventually been able to pay for the audiobook. Before Kobo, when you could put it up there, you put them on another platform, they never went live on the same day. There was a long time we couldn't do preorders. So, I guess we're coming onto the AI discussion because AI-narrated audiobooks, certainly for me, ElevenLabs, the difference in the amount of work and pain for me as an audiobook narrator is incredible. So I don't know if I'm ever going to human-narrate again. I mean, it literally is fantastic. So let's come on to AI. What is Kobo's stance on AI-assisted ebooks, AI-narrated audiobooks, AI-created covers? I know this is a tough question, but we have to cover it. Tara: AI is definitely the biggest thing that is disrupting the book industry at the moment. When it comes to us at Kobo, we kind of go back to the core principles of what makes a reader's life worse, and can we avoid it? And what makes a reader's life better, and can we take advantage of it? So AI, we know, will open the floodgates to lots of books being published that are like purely machine generated, which really impacts organic discovery, especially for indies. Part of the upside of this is that it becomes a curation problem, and that's something that we're here for . We're here to solve that problem. So with Kobo Writing Life specifically, we accept AI audiobooks, and we just ask that they're clearly labeled that it's machine read. It's really just a customer expectation or just have something that's mentioning that it's a machine read audiobook. We do discourage the publication of ebooks that are solely generated by AI, and this is just trying to root out the bad actors . We're not trying to root out any authors who are serious about making a career with their works, but we're just trying to discourage the people that are bad actors within this space. So when we think about it from an indie author perspective, I think it's good practice to include disclosure, which I think is something that you do, Joanna. I think of you as like a leader in the best practices in this space. Joanna: I do try. Just on the audiobook, so I have a button, like a yellow button, that says \u201cdigitally narrated.\u201d It's so funny because I see now in the traditional publishing industry they're saying, \u201cOh, we need labeling,\u201d and I'm like, I've been labeling my books for years. I mean, come on. Like before it was required, I ticked all the boxes and talked about it. Also, I don't have an issue with that. I think honesty is really important. Also, I feel like all these things make my work better. I'm not doing it to try to scam anyone or be worse. I'm trying to be better. I do think, though, we are in a transition period. I think this will be so pervasive within a year or two that it won't make that much difference. For now, I guess, as you say, it's marking this. So I will be filling in whatever I need to fill in. Tara: Yes, I think it's good practice. I mean, it is a personal decision, and I think you just have to think about the reader. You just don't want to disappoint the person that is buying your book. Like, that's what it ultimately comes down to for us. Then we also know that it's okay to use AI as a tool, especially with indie authors who have to balance writing with the entire business of also being your own publisher. So whether you're using it as a tool to create you a calendar or spreadsheet that makes sure that you're hitting all your preorder dates. There's things that can make your life easier because you have to wear so many hats. So we understand that as well. So when I think about AI, like from a book selling perspective, I think the interesting opportunity comes in how we can leverage AI in some of our recommendations, like summarizations and curation . So I can't really go into too much detail on what we're working on yet, but we're really excited about better recommendations and curation that really benefit us all. We just want to keep people's attention on long form reading by putting really good stuff in front of them, and we can do this without using books as training data inside an LLM. So, yes, we're excited about this. Any Kobo Writing Life authors that are listening, you can expect some changes for to the Kobo Writing Life terms to come. I hope that things aren't seen as anything that's too scary. We're really trying to just support some new initiatives and be really, really clear about what we're asking for. We're not interested in making new content. We don't want to make things from books that authors entrust us with. What we do want to do is make reading better and keep people reading more and for longer. We're trying to earn a space in reading amongst everything else that's going on in the digital world, and we really believe that we can do this. Joanna: Yes, I like that. It's interesting, though, because you mentioned there about\u2014and this is obviously important\u2014that you're not going to just upload everyone's books to some big LLM and do stuff with it. You're not going to do that. It's funny because for many, many years, I've said, \u2018why is the book itself not the metadata?' So we've had to come up with categories, keywords. We've had to have genre-specific covers. The thing is, if I have a book, say Death Valley \u2014it's like 70,000 words, it's a full length thriller\u2014and I have to write a sales description, which is\u2014well, in fact, Claude writes my sales descriptions now\u2014but it's not long enough. What you want with some kind of AI curation recommendation engine is the emotional promise of this, the characters in this, the feeling you get by reading this, matches these books over here, which just will not be surfaced in a normal book recommendation engine. In fact, for the last year or so\u2014 I've been using ChatGPT as my main book recommendation engine because it can do this much more nuanced search. I found really some quite old books as well have come up. So is that something that\u2014I know you're not going to read everything in\u2014but what do you think about that? Tara: I think you're spot on in the kind of way that the book recommendations can be going and can be leveraged. We just want to make more thoughtful recommendations. It's interesting that you're saying that it's older books too, because that's something that we see with the subscription with Kobo Plus when I look at some of the top read books. They're often coming from like 2017, 2018. So there's ways to resurface things that exist that people want to read . We can do this in a thoughtful way and an easier way than us having to rely on metadata that's been provided. If I want to be able to find a list of like Canadian authors, it's not as easy as potentially it can be. There's instances like that. It's all about, again, trying to find the right book for the right reader and just keeping them reading . That's what we're focused on. Joanna: At the end of the day, I mean, we're book people, and it kind of drives me up the wall when authors get annoyed with other authors. I'm like, look, let's get upset about how much time people spend gaming or how much time people to spend on TV. We just want everyone to read. Whatever they read is good. We just want people to read books. I know, obviously, that's what Kobo wants as well. Tara: I think it was like on Threads or a meme or something that I read recently, where it was like, reading is almost radical now . In a time where we just want faster content and we're consuming things faster, it's a bit radical to be like, actually, I'm going to sit down for two hours and just be immersed in this world and really think about myself and expand my thoughts on other things because I'm not going to be distracted by four things at once. It must have been some meme that, ironically, grabbed my attention for this radical thought process. Joanna: That's ironic. Tara: I know, but I was just like, that's right. It's something that we don't do. I mean, it's, I guess, comparable to going to the movies and like actually sitting there and not being distracted. It's the same sort of thing where it's radical to take that time for yourself, and we want people to be able to do that. Joanna: We're almost out of time, but I just wanted us to mention the Kobo Writing Life Podcast. Since this is a podcast, people might enjoy the KWL Show, and that has been going for many years now. What can people find over on the KWL Podcast if they want to click over and have a listen? Tara: We just released episode 366, which is wild. So you can find us anywhere where you listen to podcasts . We release an episode every week, but we rotate between new interviews, and then we've been resurfacing some of our great content from our backlist with a little thing we're calling the Kobo Rewriting Life Podcast. So there'll be a new episode, a Rewriting Life new episode, and so on and so forth. There's a wealth of really good information. We focus on the craft and business of writing. It's a mix of traditional authors and indies. Jo, you've been a guest, and we'd love to have you back. I think you're going to come on soon. Joanna: Yes, at some point. Tara: I think for anyone that is interested in Kobo, or maybe you're new to what we do, at the end of 2024 we released an interview with Michael Tamblyn, who is our CEO. He is probably a little bit more eloquent than me in explaining the things that we've just talked about. He really gives a great outline of Kobo, Kobo Writing Life, and I just really like being able to spotlight that because it really informs the fact that Kobo is a book company, and we're being led by a book guy. I think that's something to be celebrated, and just kind of shows our overall focus into the reading space. Joanna: Well, we should also remind people what Kobo is an acronym for. Tara: Literally, it's the word \u2018book.' Joanna: I feel like we forget to say that because we know it, but there might be people listening who didn't know. Tara: I worked there for years before I realized that it was actually an anagram of the word book. I think I was definitely three years in before it hit me. I was like, oh, right. Joanna: Oh, yes, that's what it is. Michael Tamblyn is\u2014I've been at London Book Fair\u2014and he's often the very best speaker in publishing. I mean, he really is very entertaining and very positive about indie authors, which I really appreciate. I've heard him defend indie authors to the publishing industry. So I love that, and I'm obviously a happy KWL user. So Tara\u2014 Where can people find the Kobo Writing Life team if they want to connect? Tara: So you can email us at writinglife@kobo.com . We're on most of the socials. We haven't quite ventured into TikTok yet, but you can find us on Facebook and Instagram and Threads and YouTube. If you are interested in creating an account or learning more about it, you can go to Kobo.com/writinglife . Joanna: Brilliant. Thanks so much for your time, Tara. That was great. Tara: Thank you.

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Electrical & Electronics Security Camera TP-Link 15 Apr 8:00am Related Stores Amazon AU Marketplace Comments GordonR on 14/04/2025 - 16:31 Have three wireless Tapo cameras, the driveway one gets the most action (despite my attempts to reduce the sensitivity and range) and runs out of battery. Can I buy solar panel only to attach to existing camera? luismuv on 14/04/2025 - 16:34 +3 Yes https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0D6WGRTW5 Timtamdoritos on 14/04/2025 - 16:58 +3 Bought 1 from eBay almost a year back(21 AUD). Still working great. I have one more tapo camera and doorbell so when battery goes down on others I just replace with the one connected to solar panel.So, don\u2019t have to wait for batteries to get charged. Stays 100% most of the days. bobvegas on 14/04/2025 - 16:35 +2 These aren't as smart as eufy's, many more false alerts if you're only interested in being alerted for people. lint on 14/04/2025 - 16:37 Do these at least continue recording for as long as motion continues to be detected? The Eufy cameras max out at 2 minutes per detection, which is bad if you need to record an entire event. bobvegas on 14/04/2025 - 16:49 These are also 2 minutes, which doesn't seem to make sense given the solar panel, I quickly had a look at mine, I do have it set on 'optimal' but the time can still be adjusted manually and it only goes up to 120 seconds lint on 15/04/2025 - 10:06 Thanks. Shame they put such a limitations on these battery cameras despite the possibility of charging with solar. Tyrx on 14/04/2025 - 16:54 If you need to record an entire event, you shouldn't be using battery cameras like this. The won't start recording until a few seconds after the motion is detected. lint on 15/04/2025 - 10:06 True, but the limitation on how long they can record for after they do actually start recording is a bit baffling. Jimothy Wongingtons on 14/04/2025 - 16:57 I run eufy and imou and I found get a lot of false alerts everyday fwiw bobvegas on 14/04/2025 - 19:28 +2 With the eufy's I get false alert but you can at least see how the AI made the mistake, like cats, dogs, birds, possums , at least they're mammals and it happens if they get up close to camera but with the Tapo's sometimes it's wind blowing plants, but other times it's nothing at all, it gets worse when it rains. It will sometimes detect cars as people which is a problem when I only have People detection set. They all make mistakes but Tapo is much worse in comparison to Eufy as far as AI detection, but the Tapo's are so much cheaper though. ozmma on 14/04/2025 - 21:50 I have a Tapo C120 and it constantly detects pigeons and neighbour\u2019s cat as people\u2026 super annoying. I ended up turning off notifications completely. Now I just use it to manually check around the house or scrub through recorded footage if needed. It supports RTSP streams, but they\u2019re really unstable\u2026 even with a high-end router just 5 feet away from the camera. If you\u2019re serious about surveillance, you\u2019re better off with PoE cameras on a wired network and backed by a UPS. That setup is much more reliable. That said, some camera brands are buggy even with PoE, so it\u2019s worth doing your research. Frigate devs there recommend Dahua and Hikvision for their stream stability, but those cameras can be pricey. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. seriousquokka on 14/04/2025 - 18:08 Yeah, my indoor C210 all of a sudden started to get false alerts, a few times a day in mid day. But I couldn\u2019t see anything moving, not even the sunlight/shadows. So I pointed it to the wall now. zuby on 14/04/2025 - 17:01 Are the recordings encrypted so you can only view with tp=link app. Or can you view the recordings with 3rd party app eg VLC etc hyq1031 on 14/04/2025 - 17:05 saw lots of bad reviews with the battery life. Kanosha on 14/04/2025 - 17:59 Battery life is OK. I maybe get around 1.5 months (45-50 days) of battery life before I need to charge it again. Definitely nowhere near the \"up to 300 days\" of battery life it claims. Funnily enough the doorbell that I have from Tapo lasts more than twice as long (around 3 months) before I need to charge that. Juice08 on 15/04/2025 - 08:30 I would assume though with the solar panel it will last longer? Thinking of mounting this where I'd need a ladder to get it down to recharge. knackers on 14/04/2025 - 18:00 damn, i bought the camera only for $65 two weeks ago Grange Hermit on 14/04/2025 - 18:07 Feel your pain. I paid $107 for the whole kit at Bunnings recently. gimmedealspls on 14/04/2025 - 18:36 This is about to be an old model with the C460 that has just come out which is 4K Kanosha on 14/04/2025 - 20:21 Interesting. This even has \"24/7\" recording at 1fps. I suppose this detects things a lot more quickly but I also wonder how much more this feature will drain my battery. 3DL3 on 14/04/2025 - 19:49 +5 I do not have a subscription and can view remotely. deemax33 on 14/04/2025 - 21:39 I bought TP C426 KIT and was unable to view alerts remotely. Would you like to share how you got yours setup ? ldd-mn on 14/04/2025 - 21:43 +2 Set it up using the Tapo app and turn on notifications. Done. deemax33 on 14/04/2025 - 21:45 @ldd-mn: I did the same, and it takes me to the subscriptions page for rich notifications. When I\u2019m outside, I can\u2019t access the cameras, but when I\u2019m connected to the home Wi-Fi, I can. deemax33 on 14/04/2025 - 22:31 @deemax33: Thanks all - for some reason the mobile data was off for the app!

I have one of these and didn\u2019t do the research before I bought it. According to TP-Link this one won\u2019t support streaming to an NVR because of some battery constraint. https://www.tp-link.com/au/support/faq/2680 thesab on 14/04/2025 - 19:01 Thanks for confirming! ozmma on 14/04/2025 - 21:54 Don\u2019t regret it! even if you had bought a Tapo camera with RTSP support, it still wouldn\u2019t have worked reliably. Pidapipo on 14/04/2025 - 21:12 Anyone knows a suitable mount to attach this to the gutter? I can mount the camera under the eaves, but we don\u2019t have a good location for the solar panel with the gutter and eaves running around the front where I want to install the camera. Looking into it I have found gutter mount for Eufy and ring camera, but not Tapo. Dolt2020 on 14/04/2025 - 21:32 I probably have the same issue but had seen references to generic gutter mounts from past security camera deals - so I've been looking to see what's available on Temu and Aliexpress - pretty sure I'll be able to get something suitable, just want to get a hands on look at the camera tomorrow - what I've been seeing are gutter clamps with various types of plate mounts for the camera/solar panel. Hopefully someone with first hand experience (for this cam) might post something a little more specific Pidapipo on 14/04/2025 - 22:39 I have seen third party mounts on Amazon that look like they can hold the solar panel.

Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email The mission is first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. Washington, United States: Pop star Katy Perry will be the biggest name in an all-female group set to touch the edge of space Monday, roaring into the cosmos on one of billionaire Jeff Bezos' rockets. The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. 'Inspiration' Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy,\" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.\" \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl,\" will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission.

Historically, they have indeed been precious metals. However, they are not the only ones. There are elemental metals that are rarer and more expensive than gold. They have important industrial uses\u2026.and in some cases, they are much more expensive. Learn more about platinum, palladium, and rhodium, the other precious metals, on this episode of Everything Everywhere Daily. I\u2019ve previously done episodes on both gold and silver. Most of you are familiar with gold and silver, and there is a good chance many of you own at least a little in the form of jewelry, coins, or silverware. Silver and gold are two of the seven metals that were known in the ancient world, the others being iron, lead, copper, tin, and mercury. Gold and silver were *the* precious metals for thousands of years. However, starting in the 18th century, scientists began discovering a whole host of new elements, including new metals. In this episode, I\u2019m going to focus on three metals: platinum, palladium, and rhodium. There are other metals which some might consider precious, including rhenium, osmium, and iridium. However, by the end of this episode, you\u2019ll see why I\u2019ve decided to focus on these three elements. I\u2019m guessing that most of you have heard of platinum, some of you have heard of palladium, and most of you probably don\u2019t have a clue what rhodium is. All three of these metals are in the platinum group of elements on the periodic table, along with ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. Before I get into what they have in common and their primary use, I\u2019d like to go through the history of each metal. The first known use of platinum predates European awareness by centuries. Indigenous peoples in pre-Columbian South America, particularly in what is now Colombia and Ecuador, worked with platinum-like alloys as early as 600 BC. Archaeologists have uncovered jewelry and artifacts composed of a naturally occurring mixture of platinum, gold, and other platinum group metals. However, due to platinum\u2019s high melting point and chemical inertness, these ancient artisans did not isolate it but instead used native metal alloys found in alluvial river deposits. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the 16th century, they encountered these mysterious white metals in the rivers of New Granada, or modern-day Colombia. The Spanish called the metal platina , meaning \u201clittle silver,\u201d viewing it as an impurity mixed with gold. They considered it a nuisance and even discarded it. Some records suggest they tried to artificially transmute platinum into gold, unaware of its distinct properties. Platina is the root of the word platinum. Despite this early encounter, platinum remained unappreciated and misunderstood in Europe for nearly two centuries. Platinum entered the scientific consciousness in the 18th century. Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish naval officer and scientist, is often credited with introducing platinum to Europe. In 1735, during a scientific expedition to South America, he observed the metal and brought samples back to Spain. His report, published in 1748, drew the attention of chemists and mineralogists across Europe. In the mid-18th century, William Brownrigg and Charles Wood conducted early studies of platinum in England. They noted its high melting point and resistance to corrosion, key traits that hinted at its future usefulness. In France, chemist Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Chabaneau made significant progress in refining platinum by the 1780s. He was among the first to succeed in producing malleable platinum by painstakingly removing impurities such as iron, gold, and other platinum group metals, allowing it to be shaped and used for practical purposes. In 1803, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston discovered a more efficient method for purifying platinum using aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride. Platinum, along with the other metals in the platinum group, as well as gold, are often called noble metals because they are very resistant to corrosion. Despite its scarcity, platinum gained traction in coinage and jewelry in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Russia, under the reign of Tsar Nicholas I, platinum rubles were minted between 1828 and 1845. These were the first major coins made from platinum, using Russian reserves from the Ural Mountains, where platinum had been discovered in the early 1800s. In the decorative arts, platinum\u2019s bright luster and resistance to tarnish made it a favorite among jewelers, especially in the Edwardian and Art Deco periods. Its strength allows for intricate designs that securely hold gemstones, which makes it highly desirable in high-end jewelry. Platinum is slightly more common in the Earth\u2019s crust than gold, having an abundance of 5 parts per billion. It has the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is silver, dense, malleable, and non-corrosive. As of the recording of this episode, platinum had a spot price of $948.00 USD per ounce, although it has reached as high as $1300 per ounce. Palladium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston the guy who is credited with the discovery of the purification of Platinum. Wollaston was working on refining platinum ore from South America using aqua regia to dissolve the platinum and then chemically separating other elements from the solution. While experimenting, Wollaston identified a new metal with distinct properties. To confirm its novelty and avoid public skepticism, he first anonymously offered samples for sale in a London mineral shop under the name \u201cpalladium,\u201d after the recently discovered asteroid Pallas, which itself had been named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athena. Only later did Wollaston reveal himself as the discoverer. Although initially met with some controversy and disbelief, because the scientific community was suspicious of anonymous claims, the uniqueness of palladium was eventually confirmed. Over time, it was accepted as a new element and added to the growing catalog of metallic elements essential to chemistry and metallurgy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, palladium was occasionally used in jewelry, often alloyed with gold to create \u201cwhite gold.\u201d Its brightness and tarnish resistance made it a preferred material for fine settings and wedding bands. It was used in coinage as well, primarily in commemorative or bullion coins issued by countries like Russia, Canada, and Sierra Leone. Palladium is more plentiful than platinum at 15 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust. It has the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46. Its properties are very similar to those of platinum. As of the recording of this episode, palladium had a spot price of $903 per ounce, with a peak over $3200 per ounce. Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, the year after he discovered Palladium. He discovered it by analyzing the same samples of platinum ore, imported from South America, using the same techniques he used to discover palladium. After removing platinum and palladium from the solution, Wollaston noticed a rose-colored compound remaining in the residue. Through further analysis, he isolated a new, previously unknown element. He named it rhodium, derived from the Greek word rhodon , meaning \u201crose,\u201d in reference to the pinkish color of its chloride salt, rhodium chloride. Rhodium\u2019s chemical symbol is Rh, and its atomic number is 45. It is extremely rare, estimated at about 0.7 parts per billion in the Earth\u2019s crust, rarer than gold or platinum. Rhodium is one of the most reflective metals known, making it ideal for mirrors and coatings. Like the other platinum group metals, it is corrosion-resistant, resisting attacks from most acids and atmospheric elements. It is also not rose colored as it is named, in its base metal form. Rhodium is not mined directly. It is obtained almost exclusively as a byproduct of platinum and nickel mining, which limits its supply. As of the recording of this episode, rhodium has a spot price of $5,250 per ounce, making it one of the most expensive elements regularly used in industry. It has reached prices as high as $27,000 an ounce. All three of these metals have similar properties: they are rare, silvery, and non-corrosive. However, they also share another attribute: they all have catalytic properties. They can accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed. In particular, all three of these rare and expensive metals are used in catalytic converters in automobiles. Catalytic converters are pollution control devices installed in vehicle exhaust systems that transform harmful emissions into less dangerous substances. These devices represent one of the most significant advances in automotive environmental technology since the 1970s. At its core, a catalytic converter functions through chemical reactions that occur when exhaust gases pass through its structure. These reactions don\u2019t happen spontaneously at exhaust temperatures, which is why catalysts are necessary\u2014they enable these chemical transformations without being consumed. The primary reactions occurring within a catalytic converter include oxidation reactions, which add oxygen to molecules like carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and reduction reactions, which remove oxygen from nitrogen oxide compounds. Through oxidation, carbon monoxide becomes carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons convert to carbon dioxide and water vapor. Through reduction, nitrogen oxides break down into separate nitrogen and oxygen molecules. A catalytic converter\u2019s structure consists of several carefully engineered layers. At the center is the substrate or core, typically made from ceramic material formed into a honeycomb pattern. This design creates thousands of tiny channels through which exhaust gases flow. The honeycomb structure maximizes surface area within a compact space. When all the microscopic pores are considered, a modern catalytic converter can contain a surface area equivalent to several football fields. Some high-performance vehicles use metallic substrates instead, which offer better durability under extreme temperature conditions. The washcoat, a layer approximately 20-150 micrometers thick and composed primarily of aluminum oxide, covers this substrate. This washcoat serves multiple purposes: It increases the surface area even further, provides a suitable surface for catalyst adhesion, and can include additional components that enhance catalytic activity. The rough, porous nature of the washcoat creates an environment where gas molecules and catalytic sites can interact effectively. The actual catalyst materials are embedded within this washcoat. Platinum is an excellent oxidation catalyst, facilitating the conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into less harmful substances. Palladium performs similar functions to platinum and has become increasingly important as platinum prices have fluctuated. Rhodium specializes in the reduction side, helping to break down nitrogen oxides. These precious metals are used in extremely small quantities\u2014typically just a few grams per converter\u2014but their effect is profound. Temperature plays a crucial role in catalytic converter operation. These devices require heat to function properly, generally becoming effective above approximately 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). When a car is just being started, before the converter reaches this temperature, emissions are significantly higher. This has led to various strategies in modern vehicles, including positioning converters closer to the engine, using electric heating elements, or incorporating specialized materials that become active at lower temperatures. Not surprisingly, catalytic converter theft has become a significant and growing problem worldwide due to the high value of the precious metals they contain. These metals can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars per ounce on the black market, making catalytic converters attractive targets for thieves. The devices are relatively easy to remove from vehicles\u2019 undercarriages, often within minutes using basic tools. They also lack traceability, allowing stolen units to be quickly sold to unscrupulous scrap dealers. Hybrid vehicles, trucks, and SUVs are particularly vulnerable because they either contain higher quantities of these metals and/or have elevated frames that make access to the catalytic converters easier. It is possible to buy platinum and palladium bullion and jewelry. Platinum is more common as a metal for these purposes, but both can be found. Rhodium, because of its scarcity and price, is much harder to find, but it is possible if, for whatever reason, you wanted to own some. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium are all rare, expensive, shiny precious metals. However, that isn\u2019t why they are important. It is their unique chemical properties that make the elements in such demand, as they are largely responsible for the reduction in harmful emissions from automobiles.

Adams initially backed Trump\u2019s tariffs but later exposed inflated figures, arguing the real issue is U.S. consumerism\u2014Americans prefer buying goods over manufacturing them. Nations like China and Singapore are ditching the dollar, with ASEAN countries urged to prioritize regional trade, accelerating the decline of U.S. financial dominance. Adams forecasts skyrocketing food prices, homelessness, and violent crime as the dollar collapses, warning the U.S. faces global economic isolation. Adams urges immediate investment in physical gold and silver, predicting fiat currencies will fail, and endorsing Peter Schiff\u2019s hyperinflation warnings. In a fiery broadcast on Brighteon Broadcast News, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, issued a stark warning: President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies are accelerating a global economic decoupling that could plunge the United States into financial ruin. Adams argues that Trump\u2019s miscalculations\u2014including misleading claims about foreign tariffs\u2014are destabilizing international trade and pushing nations like China, Singapore, and ASEAN members to abandon the U.S. dollar. The fallout, he warns, could include hyperinflation, mass poverty, and supply chain breakdowns. The Tariff Sheriff\u2019s Reckoning Adams opened his April 14, 2025, broadcast with a satirical song titled Trump the Tariff Sheriff, mocking the president\u2019s hardline trade policies. But the tone quickly shifted to alarm. \u201cTrump breaks the world,\u201d Adams declared, likening the collapse of U.S. dollar hegemony to Humpty Dumpty\u2019s irreversible fall. The first critical fracture, Adams noted, came in 2022 when Western nations froze Russian assets, signaling that foreign reserves in dollars or euros could be seized at will. The second shock arrived with Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, announced on April 2, 2025. Adams initially supported the tariffs, believing Trump\u2019s claim that China imposed a 67% tariff on U.S. goods\u2014until he discovered the numbers were inflated. \u201cTrump\u2019s team calculated trade imbalances and called them tariffs,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d The real issue, he argued, is America\u2019s insatiable consumerism: \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to work in factories, but they do want to buy stuff made in factories.\u201d The Great Decoupling Adams pointed to Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister, who recently delivered a scathing critique of Trump\u2019s policies, urging ASEAN nations to prioritize regional trade and ditch the dollar. China, meanwhile, is anchoring an alternative financial system, backed by gold reserves and bilateral currency swaps. \u201cThe U.S. is going to be embargoed by the entire world,\u201d Adams warned. \u201cCountries are cutting the ropes\u2014they won\u2019t let America drag them down.\u201d He predicts skyrocketing food prices, rampant homelessness, and a surge in violent crime as the dollar collapses. Gold as the Last Lifeline Adams\u2019 most urgent advice? Buy physical gold and silver\u2014now. \u201cIf you don\u2019t own precious metals, you will be financially wiped out,\u201d he said, dismissing fiat currencies as \u201cgoing to zero.\u201d He endorsed Peter Schiff\u2019s Crash Proof 2.0, which forecasts hyperinflation and a dollar collapse, and urged listeners to stockpile tangible assets. His grim conclusion: \u201cTrump is conducting a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy.\u201d Whether by design or ignorance, the result is the same\u2014a world abandoning America, leaving its citizens to face the consequences alone.

The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy,\" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.\" \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl,\" will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024. All rights reserved.

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

After opening toasted sesame oil should be tightly capped refrigerate and use within 6 months. It is a condiment, a post-cooking finishing oil not a cooking oil.

However, the idea is more about levelling the global playing field by building a much more open, collaborative stack. Francesco Bonfiglio, CEO of cloud exchange platform Dynamo, an Italian cloud services company, says EuroStack\u2019s all about teaming up to create a European tech ecosystem alternative, including cloud. The concept answers a new wave of protectionist practice and sovereignty concerns that have increasingly come to the fore worldwide. \u201cWe need to do something. We understand the importance of digital infrastructures, and cloud in particular, as a new strategic infrastructure for the economy, societies, politics and democracy in general,\u201d Bonfiglio tells Computer Weekly. The hegemony of giant tech firms, often in the US, has continued to loom larger. In cloud, this is signified by the growing dominance of hyperscalers \u2013 especially Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google. Of course, the power of Silicon Valley stems in part from capital investments over decades that cannot today be easily replicated. However, that\u2019s not to say nothing can be done. What is EuroStack? A EuroStack pitch document came out in January 2025 which notes that 2024\u2019s Draghi competitiveness report identified that a failure to take \u201cfull advantage of the digital revolution\u201d is a key cause of Europe acquiring an \u201ceconomic laggard\u201d status. An industry-driven initiative, EuroStack therefore seeks to develop an integrated digital ecosystem, with an entire value chain encompassing software, services, hardware and solutions. According to the 100 or so organisations involved so far, the IT environment has become \u201cfundamentally extractive, with data and economic rents appropriated through unfair bargains between super-dominant providers and us, the dependents\u201d. A growing body of laws and regulations representing \u201cmultiple attempts\u201d at competition intervention have failed \u2013 and slowed home-grown companies further with compliance demands. \u201cFurther, the \u2018occupation\u2019 of spaces is massively accelerating as US hyperscalers are aggressively marketing AI tools and services as key to European growth and prosperity,\u201d it says. The topline objective is to boost security, redundancy and resilience, opportunities, sovereignty and governance through direct industry action, bottom-up rather than top-down. This should be supported by five policy pillars: Recognise and define a European digital industrial policy (EDIP) across European commission functions. Build strategic digital infrastructures, first by aggregating \u201cbest of breed\u201d existing assets and supporting them with integration platforms, then by increasing industry collaboration. Support this aggregation with public and private investments, including in costly parts of the value chain. Select aligned interventions and measure results in terms of business outcomes that drive economic autonomy. Seek cooperation with third-party states that share common goals. A successor to Gaia-X In a sense, EuroStack appears a successor to a more or less stillborn Gaia-X . Bonfiglio says the Gaia-X concept had \u201cthe political message\u201d but less of a clear action plan. One key for EuroStack is ensuring organisations and consumers trust digital services and platforms. Technological quality and innovation is available in Europe, if not always adequately commercialised. Also, many remain nervous about data handling, privacy and intellectual property (IP). \u201cWe need to make that simple,\u201d Bonfiglio says. \u201cWe need transparency, controllability and interoperability. And if you want to lock me in, I won\u2019t let you in.\u201d Cloud federation has to go beyond technical federation too because no single operator will invest in becoming interoperable with another without related business opportunities. Concretely, cloud services providers Aruba, Ionos and Dynamo have just introduced the Sovereign European Cloud API (SECA) as a best-in-class industry standard for cloud infrastructure management. The next requirement is for potential customers to be able to find the European solutions they need. Bonfiglio says providers all over the world can and perhaps should build their own version of EuroStack, even organisations from the US itself: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be hostage to these three private companies either.\u201d Cloud infrastructure services investment globally is still growing. Canalys reported 20% year over year to Q4 2024 and similar for 2025. However, 64% of that total spend is on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Bonfiglio estimates that European providers have less than a 10% share of the market \u2013 and that share is shrinking, with most European datacentre capacity already either owned or rented by hyperscalers. \u201cIn 2028, hyperscalers will likely control 75% of our datacentres. It\u2019s an application of ancient colonisation techniques \u2013 only now it\u2019s not tea plantations but GW and square metres,\u201d says Bonfiglio. \u201cBut we can start to change this now, leveraging our existing assets.\u201d Change will be tricky \u2013 what is the best way? Nicky Stewart, senior adviser at the Open Cloud Coalition, retains doubts regarding strategy. After all, managing change across 27 member states remains \u201cincredibly complex\u201d. Regulation needs harmonisation, or even strengthening, and addressing competition could be simpler, she suggests. \u201cCertainly the hyperscalers have become all-powerful in technology; there\u2019s been fast growth, enormous concentration, and, if you like, anti-competitive business practices,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cBuyers don\u2019t always want the homogeneous, one-size-fits-all answer when it can be better provided with better customer service \u2013 and often keener pricing \u2013 by other cloud providers.\u201d Stevenage-based cloud services provider Civo is also a member of the Open Cloud Coalition. Chief commercial officer Simon Hansford adds that options are needed, with digital sovereignty entailing differential data handling. Some data is far more important and private. The way you handle, store and share it should recognise that. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t travel abroad, but that we put more economic value on it,\u201d adds Hansford. EuroStack as it is envisaged would better recognise the value of data and related industries. If you do not have sovereignty over a given resource, you control how you drive value. \u201cA clear example might be Airbus. Europe decided to build its own aircraft, rather than becoming a manufacturing site or maintenance site for Boeing, which would have been very easy to do,\u201d says Hansford. Today, this appears to have been a good decision. Without recognition of value, it can be very difficult to develop a local ecosystem \u2013 from education, training and certification to OEM \u2013 that drives jobs and businesses beyond indirect sales and services. \u201cThe majority of Europe\u2019s cloud professionals are in sales, marketing, pre-sales engineering and the like. AWS and Microsoft might say they\u2019ve got 1,000-2,000 people in the UK, but if they\u2019re all pre-sales, there\u2019s no research or core engineering done there,\u201d Hansford points out. \u201cWe have got to start creating demand by moving money away from the hyperscalers into our local industry.\u201d Solange Viegas Dos Reis, chief legal officer at French infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provider OVHCloud, points out that Amazon, Microsoft and Google have power that extends beyond cloud as well. \u201cThey have more and more power, and use that to strengthen what they have in other markets too,\u201d she says. OVHCloud has signed up. With EuroStack, business and industry have finally understood the direct impact that politics, and indeed geopolitics , can have on economics, she says, adding: \u201cWe need to get rid of dependencies on other countries where the political pressure can have a direct effect on us.\u201d Freedom of choice and innovation might be achieved by having a more open provider or by developing some smaller stacks with collaborative interoperability and transparency, with \u201cgood strategic partners\u201d from outside the EU also involved. She notes that when your data is hosted on hyperscaler servers, there is a risk that your activity competes with one or more of theirs, because they are so large and dominant. Or that it can be accessed by other governments for reasons with which you would not agree. Data and digital sovereignty is about more than competition. \u201cEuroStack makes me hope that we may go faster and be more precise on the needs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ambitious, for sure, but it\u2019s driven by economics, business and industry, and with strong leaders. It\u2019s not just a couple of lawyers in the room trying to make more regulation.\u201d Tackling the issues with regulation, top down, has not worked so far. Of course, it\u2019s a challenge, not least because it involves companies from diverse sectors up and down tech stacks. And there will likely be resistance from some. \u201cWe must coordinate everyone and identify the common challenges and elements,\u201d Viegas Does Reis says. \u201cBut the objective will benefit all the world, the whole tech ecosystem.\u201d Mark Neufurth, lead strategist and programme manager for SECA at cloud services provider Ionos, agrees that EuroStack models an initiative that could benefit organisations worldwide, and that is important. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no [actual EuroStack progress] development as of now, Europe has to develop a \u2018target picture\u2019 in the light of current politics, which are changing fast,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise, we will be out of business in a matter of years in terms of digitisation and digital things.\u201d That\u2019s all while the hyperscalers are still coming to, for instance, Berlin or wherever to take advantage of local innovation, Neufurth adds. Meanwhile, EuroStack has seven layers and takes a \u201chuge work package\u201d to get it off the ground. Software, hardware and services must be defined, resourced and built. Local problems, including potential inertia, must be overcome. That said, there are already European designs for low-energy chips here, and the cloud API standard SECA , so that should all help, Neufurth says. Of course, economies of scale must be developed. Other organisations, in other countries, can and should develop similar initiatives, including the UK \u2013 but partnering is key. Overall, however, the vision will take years, even decades, to materialise, Neufurth adds. \u201cNonetheless, we need this. It\u2019s essential that we emancipate ourselves a bit from China and the USA,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be less of a single point for failures, and of course better competition.\u201d Read more about competition in the cloud market CCS Insight\u2019s Bola Rotibi looks at the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s plans to regulate the public cloud.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

Posted on Apr 14, 2025 Subscribe to Shopping Newsletter Caret Down 28 Flowy Dresses You'll Basically Live In All Spring Now that the sun's social battery has recharged, it's time to stock up on maxis and midis. by Daniel Boan BuzzFeed Staff Facebook Pinterest Link Unless otherwise specified, all sizes in this post are listed in women's. 1. A flowy maxi with whimsical tied straps \u2014 it'll be your go-to dress for the influx of bridal showers you're currently getting invitations to. The bodice is nice and stretchy, while the tiered skirt will basically float around you as if you're carrying your own personal fan. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Such a cute and comfy dress! It has a fun flow to the bottom of it, and the ties for straps add an extra dose of fabulous.\" \u2014 Kelsey Krucker Get it from Amazon for $21.78+ (available in sizes XS\u20134XL and 14 styles). 2. A V-neck dress featuring an adjustable twist-tie waist that comes in several cute polka-dot and floral designs \u2014 which are inarguably the two most springy patterns of all. Bonus points if you tie the belt into an adorable bow. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"For me, clothes pay for themselves based on the number of compliments that are received when an item is worn. I already liked the dress the moment I put it on, but all day long women commented about what a lovely and pretty dress it is (ooh, I like the color, ooh it\u2019s so pretty, ooh, that dress looks like the start of a whole new wardrobe). The compliments made the reasonable dress price feel like a bargain deal. I guess I\u2019m a sucker for polka dots and the power of hearing something positive during the day.\" \u2014 Isadelle Mercedes Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 19 colors). 3. A sleeveless number with a button-down design and tiered skirt if you're looking to put a unique semi-formal twist on the classic swing dress. Throw on some strappy sandals , grab a round rattan bag , and your official spring brunch 'fit is sorted. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I\u2019ve been buying lots of dresses on Amazon for an upcoming vacation, and this one hits the mark perfectly! ...This is sooo comfortable! AND it has pockets! The best part is that my husband was trying to be helpful and did laundry, and he washed and dried this dress and I found it smashed into the laundry basket three days later. Not only did it still fit, but it wasn\u2019t even wrinkled! Perfectly packable! Brb, gotta go buy all the other colors!\" \u2014 DiKat Get it from Amazon for $27.67 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 22 colors). 4. A short-sleeve button-up dress that's long and fluttery, yet lightweight and breathable, so you'll probably still be reaching for this in the fall. Reviewers say they've received tons of compliments when wearing it, and you may even feel like a \"fairytale princess.\" \ud83d\udc51 www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this dress on a whim and was a little skeptical about it. I have never received so many compliments on a dress before. I wore it on a trip to the Biltmore Estate with my husband and in laws and we honestly couldn't get through the day without someone stopping me every few minutes to ask where I got my dress or to tell me how gorgeous it was. It flowed beautifully on that windy day. I'm obsessed with it, I even bought two more in different colors. I highly recommend!!!\" \u2014 Maria Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes XS\u2013L and six colors). 5. An embroidered tulle dress so elegant and floaty it might make people curtsy or bow every time you enter the room. The vibrant floral embroidery is truly the epitome of spring, and the tulle will keep the skirt lightweight and airy as you flutter around like the spring fairy you are. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Note: Reviewers suggest having someone help you tie the corset lacing at the back. Some also say they had to adjust the straps for a more secure fit, so be sure to allow yourself time to make some alterations if necessary! Promising review: \"I don\u2019t ever write reviews but had to because this dress is literally EVERYTHING!! It\u2019s so pretty and the fabric is high quality. I just wish for more occasions to wear it!!\" \u2014 Norah Barnes Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in women's sizes 0\u201328 Plus and in 13 colors). 6. An open-back design with a halter neckline and a fabulous floor-length cut I guarantee you'll twirl around in every 15 seconds. No worries if you get dizzy and need a break \u2014 the fabric is super comfy and lightweight enough to lounge around in. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have been wanting this same dress from a store in the mall, but it was $118. I was leery about this, considering it was much cheaper in cost, but it is PERFECT! It fit absolutely perfectly. Great length, too. Keep in mind you can't wear a bra with it, and if you are larger-busted (I'm small, an A cup), then it may fit totally differently. It's thin and lightweight, but with skin-colored undies, I had no problem with lines or visibility. I'm considering buying it in another color.\" \u2014 Bullitt02797 Get it from Amazon for $32.99+ (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 34 colors). 7. An off-the-shoulder smock dress so springy and adorable, you might be crowned this year's May Queen. But not in the creepy Midsommar way. Actually, a flower crown would pair quite nicely with this... go ahead and book that flight to Sweden!! Reviewers especially love the side slit that's not only super breathable but also gives you ample room to show off your latest sandal purchase. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"Bought this for our couples beach photo session in Oahu and it was PERFECT!!! I received endless compliments whenever I\u2019ve worn this: to dinner, the farmers market, shopping\u2026anywhere and everywhere! The sleeves stay in place and don\u2019t ride up or fall down, very flowy. Buy two!!! You won\u2019t regret it! :)\" \u2014 Christi Get it from Amazon for $43.99 (available in sizes XS\u20134XL and 27 styles). 8. A short-sleeve pleated dress with the absolute best feature a dress can have \u2014 POCKETS! The wide variety of vibrant prints doesn't hurt, either. Reviewers note that while the fabric is breathable and spring friendly, it's still heavy enough to stay in place so a slip isn't necessary! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love this dress. I bought it in another print after trying it out for a few weeks. It washes and dries perfectly . Good material and pockets!!! I get so many compliments on it, especially the polka-dot one I ordered after this one. They are so versatile, and I wear it all seasons. When it is warmer as is, and in the fall and winter, I layer with it.\" \u2014 Annie Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes S\u20133XL and 28 colors). 9. A gorgeously floaty dress featuring a true wrap design, meaning you can customize it to your perfect fit. It's practically tailor-made for walking around barefoot on the grass. Like any good spring dress, reviewers say this one is super lightweight and never clingy. Amazon Promising review: \"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! I love that it is a wrap dress because you can customize the waist for how you would like it to fit. I was worried about it being too low cut (because I am large in the chest area), but it fits perfectly. I can wear a regular bra and I don't feel like I am showing too much cleavage.\" \u2014 Danielle Palermini Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in sizes XS\u20132XL, two lengths, and five colors available in the calf-length style and 20 available in the ankle-length style). 10. An A-line dress with a wrap waist design that's perfect for any upcoming spring parties... even if that party is just you and your roommate sitting around drinking wine. Bonus: it's airy enough to stick around for all your summer BBQs as well! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"You won't be disappointed by this dress. It is good quality, the fabric is not see-through at all, and I LOVE having pockets! It washes well, the colors are vibrant and I went back to order more. This is perfect for casual shopping with cute sandals or the office.\" \u2014 Domestic Bliss Get it from Amazon for $24.49 (available in sizes S\u20132XL and 30 colors). 11. A black organza dress that would go perfectly with some Doc Martens if you like to wear all-black for spring \u2014 which even Miranda Priestly would consider quite groundbreaking. Pair it with a plain black slip and TA-DA! You just found the perfect spring dress with zero floral prints or pastel colors in sight. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I use this with a simple silk undergarment of the same color...From being a beach coverup for a casual and refreshing dress for the hotter days. Size up if you have bigger arms or large breasts as it doesn\u2019t have any stretch to it at all.\" \u2014 Joan Espinoza-Gonzalez Get it from Amazon for $25.99 (available in sizes XS\u20133XL and four styles). 12. A casual-chic cocktail dress featuring gorgeous lace detailing at the waist for an extra dainty touch. It'll definitely be one of those \"excuse me, where did you buy that?\" dresses. No judgment if you decide to gatekeep it. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I was nervous about ordering online without trying on first, but BOY did it pay off. The decorative band around the middle is not at my waist. It's slightly above my waist, but not so high as to be a princess waist (right below the bust)... The skirt is all the way to the knee but not below it, so it's conservative enough to wear to a cocktail party... but also fun and twirly enough to wear out dancing (which is what I got it for). Am now looking for more dresses by this company!!!\" \u2014 GHBeckwith Get it from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in sizes 4\u201312 and 26 colors). 13. A maxi dress with a skirt so voluminous you'll be tempted to fling it from side to side every time you walk. The linen and cotton blend fabric keeps things airy and lightweight, while the long sleeves are perfect for these early days of spring when the sun needs to recharge its social battery every few days. Any Size / Etsy Promising review: \"Gorgeous dress! So generous in material. Perfectly sewn! Thank you for excellent service!\" \u2014 shirleysullivan Any Size is a small business that makes beautiful tailored garments to fit up to 6XL! They recommend dry-cleaning this dress, but just look at it \u2014 it's so worth it. Get it from Any Size on Etsy for $38.60+ (available in sizes S\u20136XL and three colors). 14. A mini shift dress that has a breathable v-cut neckline and back, so you'll immediately reach for it once the sun is finally out in full force (signaling an official ~shift~ away from leggings season!). Also, the shade on the left is called \"olive martini,\" which would be the perfect accessory. Preferably on a trendy rooftop bar with a nice stranger who offers to take pics of you and your friends when they see you struggling to take a group selfie. Impressions Impressions is an Arkansas-based woman-owned boutique serving up stylish apparel that can fit your budget. Get it from Impressions for $52 (available in sizes S\u20133XL and in navy and olive \u2014 not all sizes available in both colors). 15. A bohemian print dress \u2014 it feels like your favorite nightgown but looks trendy enough for an impromptu photo shoot when you spot the flower wall at that new restaurant that's blowing up on TikTok. Oh, and the elastic waistline will keep you comfy all day long. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This dress is super cute! Material is soft and lightweight; the fit is loose and flowy. Perfect throw-on dress for summer in Florida, but cute enough to wear to brunch or dinner.\" \u2014 Lauren Carlucci Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 31 colors). 16. A short-sleeve dress so cute, you'll be tempted to wear it on a weekly basis. You'll feel dressed up enough for an important meeting, but you won't mind lounging around in it once you get back home. The material is a lovely mid-weight fabric, so prepare to pull this back out when the early days of fall come around. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Material is light, but I love that I can wear a slip, tights, and a cardigan in the fall or winter to make this dress last year-round. Great buy!!!\" \u2014 FOUR UR Review Get it from Amazon for $31.98 (available in 14\u201326 Plus and 39 colors). 17. A ridiculously cute dress with a stretchy high-waisted design that's so comfortable you might still reach for it on your work-from-home days. It also has a unique bow-tie neckline and ruffled sleeves to help it stand out from the rest of your go-to dresses. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I needed a dress to easily pack in my suitcase that was no-iron or fancy treatment needed after the suitcase. This was for a dinner with my boyfriend's family and I was meeting them for the first time. It was such a hit. Of course, right out of the package you see it and think, 'hmmm is this too cheap looking?' but it seriously looks great on and I dressed it up with tights. I wore the other color to my boyfriend's work party. It\u2019s a great no-fuss dress that packs and wears easy.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $33.89 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 24 colors). 18. Or! A similar knee-length flared sundress , but this one has a unique buttoned skirt design that comes in so many different color combinations. You could pretty much just buy one for every day of the week and have a much more stylish version of a spring work uniform. www.amazon.com Several reviewers say this runs true to size! Promising review: \"This is dress is prefect for work, casual events, etc. I absolutely loved it and it\u2019s really comfy. The material is soft and not too heavy but heavy enough. I reside in Arizona and it\u2019s prefect for the summer! A lot of people confused it for a skirt, so I think of it as two outfits in one.\" \u2014 Robert G. Get it from Amazon for $31.90 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 10 colors). 19. A popular maxi dress with short sleeves but a super long length, making it perfect for those transitional days when it's way too warm for a jacket but not quite hot enough for shorts. And I truly meant it when I said this is popular \u2014 it's impressed over 10,000 Amazon reviewers so far! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This dress is lightweight enough to wear in warmer weather, and I'm looking forward to wearing it with tights and a long cardigan well into cooler months. A blank canvas to accessorize as you like with long necklaces, boho bracelets, a wide-brimmed hat. Looks great with sandals, probably cute with snow boots. All around a versatile, staple piece. I imagine it'd be great for capsule collections. I live with a dog who sheds fur furiously (ha), and I was easily able to shake his fur out of the dress and still go out in public.

Quechua farmer Anacleta Mamani inside her greenhouse in Poques, in Peru\u2019s Cusco region, where she practices agroecological farming as an alternative to face the effects of climate change. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS LAMAY, Peru, Apr 14 2025 (IPS) - \u201cUp here in the highlands, there\u2019s a lot of frost, and everything seems bleak. But I\u2019m so happy since I got my greenhouse and started growing vegetables in a healthy way. I feel like we\u2019re overcoming the challenges of the weather,\u201d Anacleta Mamani, a Quechua farmer from the community of Poques (about an hour\u2019s drive from Cusco, the former imperial capital of Peru), told IPS. Poques is one of 13 farming communities in the municipality of Lamay, located nearly 3,000 meters above sea level in the province of Calca, in the southeastern department of Cusco. Like much of rural Peru\u2019s Andean highlands, the area faces persistent poverty and neglect from the national government\u2014a disadvantage worsened by the climate crisis. This South American country of 34 million people is highly vulnerable to climate change, even though its greenhouse gas emissions account for less than 1 percent of the global total, according to a 2021 measurement by Peru\u2019s Environment Ministry . The ministry, citing figures from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reports that around 5.5 million Peruvians are exposed to floods and another 2.6 million to droughts. Among the most affected are family farmers, as they depend on natural resources\u2014particularly women, due to gender inequalities that limit their ability to respond. \u201cBefore, we only grew potatoes, corn, and quinoa for daily sustenance. Now we also have a variety of vegetables we didn\u2019t even know how to eat before. With the techniques we\u2019ve learned, we\u2019re better equipped to face the climate crisis, which is hitting us hard,\u201d said Mamani, one of 120 families in her community, located in Cusco\u2019s Sacred Valley, known for its landscapes and traditions. She is one of 80 women farmers taking part in a training project led by the non-governmental Flora Trist\u00e1n Peruvian Women\u2019s Center , aimed at developing their farming skills to confront climate change while increasing their participation and decision-making in community organizations. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the first step is working the land\u2014digging up to 60 centimeters deep and loosening the soil so it can breathe. Otherwise, the plants die even if you water them. That\u2019s the first good agroecological practice we\u2019re applying in the greenhouses,\u201d Mamani explained proudly. In four municipalities in Cusco, in the Andean highlands of southeastern Peru, greenhouses aim to enhance the agricultural skills of women engaged in family farming, helping them better cope with the climate crisis. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Agroecology in Daily Life A Quechua speaker born in Poques 59 years ago, Mamani has dedicated her life to farming and family work, never having the chance to attend school. Now, she feels vindicated as she enriches her ancestral knowledge as a student of the Agroecological School run by the Flora Trist\u00e1n Center with support from the Basque Development Cooperation Agency and Mugen Gainetik . \u201cFor a while now, rains, hail, and frost come at the wrong time and cause a lot of damage. Last year, the wind was so strong it flattened the cornfields, and we couldn\u2019t harvest anything\u2014just losses,\u201d she recalled, gesturing with her hands as engineer Janet Nina translated her words into Spanish for IPS. Peru\u2019s National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (Senamhi) reported that 2024 was the hottest year in the last six decades. The consequences included droughts and heavy rainfall, impacting areas like family farming, leading to crop losses and food insecurity. The 80 trained women farmers come from four districts or municipalities: San Salvador, Coya, Calca, and Lamay. Each has a 100-square-meter greenhouse equipped with a drip irrigation system, in which they\u2019ve also been trained for sustainable use. \u201cWe water just enough\u2014no more wasting water. I water my cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes early in the morning before the sun gets too strong, because I have to walk a long way from my house to the greenhouse,\u201d Mamani said.

Her children Avelina and Ricardo Cruz (second from left and first from right, respectively), along with other family members, have embraced Mamani\u2019s teachings on agroecology to protect the environment and biodiversity threatened by climate change while also improving their daily diet. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS She also grows squash ( Cucurbita pepo ), beets, chard ( Beta vulgaris ), beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), and other vegetables, now a staple in her household diet. The surplus, which is growing, is currently bartered with other families in the community, but starting in May, she will also sell them in nearby markets, providing her with her own income. Through training, she also learned to make natural fertilizers. \u201cI save fruit peels, potato skins, eggshells, and all kitchen scraps, along with ashes from the stove, animal bones, and manure from chickens, sheep, and guinea pigs. We mix it all to make fertilizer that nourishes the soil, producing healthy, strong, and tasty plants,\u201d she shared. She passes this knowledge on to her family\u2014her husband, daughter, son, and their respective families. This dynamic is replicated by other women in the Agroecological School, spreading this climate-resilient farming method. \u201cIn my mom\u2019s greenhouse, there\u2019s a special climate. We can grow many vegetables and eat better. The crops are protected from weather extremes, and we can keep practicing agroecology, caring for our environment, our Pachamama (Mother Earth), and our water for future generations,\u201d said Avelina Cruz, 36, who learns from her mother alongside her husband and teenage daughter. Her husband works in Cusco city and returns on weekends to help apply what they\u2019ve learned. \u201cWe do it carefully because, as my mom says, the plants \u2018speak.\u2019 Protecting nature is our small way of preventing climate change from destroying us,\u201d Cruz said. Diverse vegetable production with an agroecological approach is being developed on the high Andean slopes of communities in southeastern Peru. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Leading the Charge Sociologist Elena Villanueva, the project leader, emphasized the role of Andean rural women in the climate crisis. \u201cThey aren\u2019t responsible for this situation threatening food and water security and human health, yet they don\u2019t hesitate to take action,\u201d she told IPS in Cusco. She highlighted agroecology as a sustainable production model that helps restore ecosystems. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative to industrial, extractive, monoculture-based farming, which worsens global warming and harms the well-being of rural women and families,\u201d she said. She warned that \u201cwe\u2019re at a critical moment where industrialized nations most responsible for climate change are backtracking on emission reduction commitments, ignoring the consequences for vulnerable populations.\u201d She urged national policies to prioritize family farming, which supplies nearly 70% of Peru\u2019s food. \u201cOur authorities must turn their attention to the countryside, promote agroecology, and close gender gaps,\u201d she demanded. In rural areas, women have less access to land, water, seeds, and other resources while bearing heavy workloads that hinder their leadership and political participation. The mayor of Lamay, Glicerio Delgado, criticized the Peruvian government for ignoring rural development demands, including proposals to expand greenhouses and implement water catchment projects as sustainable practices to address climate challenges. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Lack of Support Peru recognizes 55 Indigenous peoples \u201451 from the Amazon and four from the Andes, including the Quechua, the largest group, with nearly five million members nationwide, including rural-to-urban migrants. About 14 percent of Peruvians speak Quechua as their first language. Peru\u2019s 2017 national census was the first to include ethnic self-identification. Andean rural women are mostly Quechua and have inherited ancestral farming knowledge. But migration and shifting community dynamics have left some struggling to adapt to climate challenges. Traditionally, reading nature\u2019s signs guided farming, but this is no longer enough with current erratic weather and rain patterns. Women now face turmoil, which causes constant worry as family farming sustains their households. Lamay\u2019s mayor, Glicerio Delgado, expressed commitment to rural development and climate resilience but lamented the lack of national support. \u201cThere\u2019s much to do\u2014expanding greenhouses, building water catchment systems for family farming led by women. But so far the Ministry of Economy and Finance hasn\u2019t responded to our funding requests,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, in the four Cusco municipalities, Anacleta Mamani and her 79 peers will keep working to sustain their homes with agroecological practices, strengthening their resilience against climate extremes.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Almost as good as the first one, did not like the fact you cant drive vehicles in this one. Otherwise, graphics game play and story is really good. Well worth it. 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Risenxone Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 6:10 PM 17 Posts Joined Dec 2013 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 6:10 PM Risenxone Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 6:10 PM 17 Posts Currently playing this on Xbox game pass and I'm really enjoying it 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad. dwong83 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:53 PM 28 Posts Joined Apr 2013 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:53 PM dwong83 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:53 PM 28 Posts Is this better on ps5 or xbox series x?

Assuming price is a factor for prospective buyers and you'd want all 3 of these movies, I can't imagine you'll ever get close to this price comparatively for the 4K versions. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Related Searches Entertainment Movies Blu-ray & 4K Blu-ray Free Shipping with Prime Online Only Amazon $55 $70 21% off Levels Grass Fed Whey Protein, 5.64 lbs Double Chocolate or Vanilla Bean $54.99 shipped at Costco.com 6 There is no voting data on this thread You have chosen to downvote this deal.

It\u2019s embarrassing to have guests over because the toilets are so gross! I have tried so many products and cleaning solutions \u2014 from natural essential oils to harsh chemicals so strong I was lightheaded for the rest of the day. Well, I tried out this pumice stone after reading about it in a BuzzFeed article, and honestly the hype is real! It does take some elbow grease, but the after picture is from only 20 minutes of scrubbing, light enough that I didn\u2019t break a sweat! The stone does get used up, but I think this one should last me a couple of years at least. So if you have embarrassing toilets, try this! \" \u2014 Stephanie Ray Get it from Amazon for $9.26 (available in multiple pack sizes). 4.

This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell, and now, after use, we can keep it. Saved me hundreds.

My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back-and-forth movement!

I tried name-brand shower cleaners and bleach to try and clean the soap scum off the tiles and tub. I had no luck and I would cough and get sick because of how strong the smell was. I thought I would try this to save my lungs. I sprayed my entire shower and left it for about 15 minutes. I came back and rinsed off the walls and they were shiny! I've never had such a clean shower. The smell is amazing and subtle. All I smell is tea tree and it didn't affect me at all. The price is also a good deal since the bottle is pretty large.

It won't... so grab this and save the pipes from yourself! www.amazon.com Please note how hard I'm trying not to make a Super Mario Bros. plumbing joke right now. Promising review: \"Y\u2019all, this thing is amazing! My kitchen sink was completely clogged for four days. I\u2019ve been trying to clear the drain with a different sink plunger that I already had and it didn\u2019t do diddly squat. I was about to give up and call a plumber.

I've made so many different rices in it. The only thing I suggest is when making rice that might end up sitting in the pot for a while, put some olive oil on the bottom as the rice tends to stick if it's sitting on the 'warm' setting for too long, or add some extra water. The rice cooker is wonderful though. It's a real time-saver. \" \u2014 Michelle Get it from Amazon for $16.74+ (available in four sizes). 14.

After seeing the results, I couldn't help but spread the word. Sure, it took some beer, a little John Mayer, and a lot of elbow grease, but I got the job done, thanks to this handy little product.

I have a family of four and would frequently have to snake our shower drain, it appears I won't be having that problem ever again. I even give my dog baths and this collects the hair.

I tested the pump to see how well it works, and it worked perfectly! Works just as well as a vacuum, just takes a little more effort pumping out the air. Using these bags, I got half my closet back!

I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it from Amazon for $39.97 . 27.

I think the intuitive, easy to use design is fantastic. We already have the muscle memory for using a spray can. In an emergency, it's so much easier to grab this and use it, and turn a small fire into a non-fire. I don't have time to remember a three step method of fire control when my bacon has gotten out of control on the stove. I'm not a firefighter! I'd really like to have one in every room. Think about it. Isn't it better to immediately contain a small fire than deal with a big one? This could save your life, and your house. \" \u2014 K. Zander Get it from Amazon for $11.99 . 32.

There was a lot of attention to detail put into the design and I particularly appreciate the wire inside the rim that holds everything steady \u2014 no more worrying about spilling all the liquid on the way to the freezer. Just a fantastic product all around. I purchased this and a cheaper version from another manufacturer at the same time but returned the other product. This one is definitely worth the added cost.\" \u2014 Kate Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (available in three colors). 33.

A reviewer in Edge highlighted the arcade releases as having both quantity and quality, and said the Atari 2600 games have held up less well and that the selection of Lynx and Jaguar games were mostly curiosities. I'll pass on this one. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Drifta Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM 92 Posts Joined Nov 2023 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM Drifta Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM 92 Posts Switch version is also $20. All these ROMs are widely available for emulation as well. All you need is something like an Anbernic to emulate these games. Still, the convenience to play them on a modern console is nice. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Slikku Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM 3,830 Posts Joined Apr 2004 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM Slikku Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM 3,830 Posts Last July this collection was on Steam for under $4.

Omnia Studios Ltd. v. JD E-Commerce America Ltd., 2025 WL 961473 (W.D.N.Y. March 31, 2025) This case involves the service Joybuy, which listed items for sale in Walmart.com\u2019s marketplace. The plaintiff alleges that Joybuy sold counterfeit items, as confirmed by test buys. The court is unclear about how Joybuy operates, but it appears that Joybuy (via the entity \u201cJD\u201d) runs its own online marketplace. As a result, the Joybuy listings on Walmart.com are actually third-party merchant listings with Joybuy syndicated to Walmart. This ruling deals with the 512(c) defense. The plaintiff argued that Joybuy/JD did not qualify as a \u201cservice provider\u201d because it was the direct merchant. This is a rare attack on the capacious definition of a service provider, and it did not succeed. The court says that Joybuy sufficiently established that it ran its own online marketplace and thus qualified as a service provider. Shockingly, the plaintiff didn\u2019t contest any of the other 512 elements, so Joybuy defeats the lawsuit. The plaintiff argued that Walmart received direct financial benefits from the listings, so it is disqualified from the 512(c) defense. Rather than address that argument, the court does a switcheroo and says that Walmart doesn\u2019t have the right and ability to control the infringements. This switcheroo doesn\u2019t answer the question on the table, because the 512(c) defense requires the defendant to BOTH not have the requisite supervisory ability AND not have a direct financial interest in the infringements. Showing that Walmart satisfied one 512(c) defense element doesn\u2019t have any bearing on a different defense element. Still ignoring the question on the table, the court explains why Walmart lacked the requisite supervisory ability: Wal-Mart exercised little influence over the activities of its users. As the operator of the marketplace, Wal-Mart allowed users to take the lead on creating listings and thereby selling products\u2014including infringing ones. Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to remove infringing content does not grant it the right and ability to control, nor does its role in screening content as it was listed. The plaintiff also argued that Walmart had red flags of infringement because it was willfully blind. The court says that even if that\u2019s true, Walmart expeditiously removed the infringing items, typically \u201cwithin a day of receiving the complaint.\u201d The court gives Walmart some grace over the exceptions: Plaintiffs point to only a small number of listings that remained active for longer periods of time, but this seems to speak more to the technical difficulties involved in curating an online marketplace than a sign of willful blindness. As reported by Snukset, these lapses are attributable to glitches within Wal-Mart\u2019s automated takedown system\u2014Plaintiffs have not submitted evidence that satisfactorily disputes this. The plaintiffs also challenged Walmart\u2019s implementation of its repeat infringer policy because it didn\u2019t terminate JD. The court accepts Walmart\u2019s explanation: Snukset explains at length why Wal-Mart did not terminate JD or its marketplaces from Walmart.com: because Wal-Mart knew that JD was \u201cnot the actual source\u201d of the infringing products and did not create the listings themselves, that JD had a relatively low number of infringement complaints relative to market volume, and a \u201clack of evidence of prior notice of Plaintiff\u2019s IP rights.\u201d All of these constitute appropriate reasons why an ISP would refrain from terminating a user. Another act of grace from the court. Having a low number of infringement complaints still would sound like a recidivist to most courts. All told, Walmart gets summary judgment on the DMCA online safe harbor defense. I can\u2019t tell why the plaintiff\u2019s narrative fell so flat before this judge, but I don\u2019t know how repeatable this ruling is. The contributory trademark infringement claim against Walmart goes the same. \u201cThe evidence shows that Defendants were on-notice that their marketplaces contained infringing listings\u2014Plaintiff and their agents issued infringement complaints on dozens of such listings. In response to these complaints, however, the evidence shows that Defendants promptly took down nearly all of the infringing listings.\u201d As Miracle Max would say, \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between mostly removed and all removed,\u201d but this court treats them as equivalent. In a footnote, the court says: \u201cWal-Mart points out that Plaintiffs assert \u201crelatively small levels of infringing sales\u2014Chinn ($311.40), Collis ($2,195.28), Omnia ($170.01) and Turkey ($153.66).\u201d Plaintiffs dispute whether these constitute \u201crelatively small levels.\u201d\u201d Say what? This case involved less than $3k of total gross sales??? That seems like dubious grounds to go after a giant business like Walmart. After II Movie, LLC v. WideOpenWest Finance LLC, No. 1:21-cv-01901-DDD-CYC (D. Colo. March 14, 2025) This is a lawsuit against an IAP for subscriber-caused copyright infringement. The contributory copyright infringement claim survives a motion to dismiss when the plaintiffs allege \u201cthat WideOpenWest was notified of over 33,750 specific instances of direct infringement at over 13,000 of its IP addresses, including approximately 100 instances of specific infringements at several IP addresses, yet it did not investigate further or take any action to stop continued infringement by the subscriber accounts associated with those IP addresses.\u201d The IAP argued that Taamneh changed contributory copyright infringement, but that argument was rejected in UMG v. Grande (see also In re Frontier ). With respect to the vicarious copyright infringement claim, the court credits the following allegations: at least one subscriber continued using WideOpenWest\u2019s internet service because WideOpenWest is \u201camazing on torrents\u201d and the subscriber had \u201cnever gotten a letter or notice\u201d despite having \u201cdownloaded truly an outrageous amount of data.\u201d That subscriber recommended WideOpenWest to someone else looking for an internet service provider that is \u201c\u2018less\u2019 strict on downloading.\u201d (Note that nothing in that subscriber\u2019s testimonial refers to copyright infringement. The subscriber could have been celebrating their massive bandwidth consumption, not their massive infringement spree). As a result, the court accepted the inference that \u201ccopyright infringement was a draw for WideOpenWest\u2019s customers, and that WideOpenWest reaped some financial benefit, via attraction or retention of accounts, directly from its users\u2019 downloading and distribution of the plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted works.\u201d As I\u2019ve mentioned many times before, treating IAPs as the deputy copyright sherriffs is bad news for the Internet. For more, see the linkwrap below. Maddry v. Luoxue, 2025 WL 822692 (N.D. Cal. March 14, 2025) The copyrighted work at issue in this case is a card game called \u201cDiscernment,\u201d which contains a deck of \u201cmade up of cards with biblical or funny Christian phrases\u201d that are garbled and need to be decoded. The copyright owner allgedly got flooded with Chinese knockoffs in online marketplaces that undercut his price. He complained to Amazon, which temporarily suspended the listings. Amazon said the listings would be restored unless he sued the knockoff merchants. He sued the online marketplaces pro se and sought an ex parte TRO for various remedies. His requests are all denied. The court says that it cannot bind the online marketplaces because they aren\u2019t defendants and thus are not reachable via FRCP 65. This goes straight to the heart of the SAD Scheme, where rightsowners keep getting TROs that purport to bind the online marketplaces\u2013seemingly lawlessly. The court says that 512(c)(3) takedown notices are supposed to provide the quick relief he seeks, and the court can\u2019t tell if he has availed himself of that procedure. This is a bit unfair to the plaintiff. 512(c)(3) is a way of disqualifying a defendant from the DMCA online safe harbor, but it\u2019s not mandatory that copyright owners send takedown notices to succeed in court. However, as a practical matter, courts have been skeptical when copyright owners sue intermediaries without trying 512(c)(3) notices first, and that appears to be the case again here. The court also says the plaintiff can discover the identity of the merchants through 512(h) subpoenas, so an ex parte TRO is unnecessary. That\u2019s true, but what about disclosures mandated in the INFORM Consumers Act? The court denies the plaintiff\u2019s request to enjoin the merchants from making listings because the complaint doesn\u2019t provide evidence of copyright registrations. An always-embarrassing mistake, even for a copyright owner proceeding pro se. Lopez v. Meta Platforms, Inc., 2025 WL 965811 (S.D.N.Y. March 31, 2025) Lopez claims copyright and trademark ownership of the \u201cNYC New York Cannabis\u201d logo: Lopez claims Meta and its users used the logo to promote the \u201cNYC Canna Cruise.\u201d The problem is that Lopez doesn\u2019t have a copyright registration in the logo because the Copyright Office refused it under its standard policy against registering logos. The unjust enrichment claim fails because it\u2019s preempted by the Copyright Act. The court doesn\u2019t give Lopez another chance to amend in part because \u201cLopez is a serial IP litigant who has filed at least 41 lawsuits in this District against more than 100 different defendants.\u201d Selected Posts About IAP Copyright Liability Internet Access Providers Face Contributory Copyright Liability for Subscribers\u2019 Infringements\u2013UMG v.

April 12, 2025 14:11 ET | Source: Whispeara Whispeara New York City, April 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hearing loss isn\u2019t just an age-related condition\u2014it\u2019s a growing global concern affecting people of all backgrounds and lifestyles. Whether it\u2019s the constant exposure to environmental noise, the long-term effects of earbud usage, or the slow, creeping impact of aging, millions are silently suffering. From asking people to repeat themselves to missing key parts of conversations, the frustration adds up. And for many, the problem isn't just hearing\u2014it\u2019s the emotional toll that comes with it. But there's hope. Whispeara can bring relief and restore the joy of sound. As social situations become more difficult and the feeling of isolation sets in, mental health can begin to deteriorate. Anxiety, fatigue, and even depression can follow when auditory clarity disappears. And while modern solutions like hearing aids promise quick relief, they often fall short of expectations. These devices can amplify sound indiscriminately, fail to address the root cause of the problem, and often come with a hefty price tag. Surgeries and prescription medications present another set of challenges, including high costs, risks, and side effects. That\u2019s why many people are turning to natural solutions\u2014remedies designed to support hearing from the inside out. But the wellness space is crowded, and not all supplements are created equal. Enter Whispeara , a powerful hearing support formula crafted with natural ingredients to help users experience sharper sound, reduced ringing in the ears, and stronger connections between the brain and auditory system. Whispeara stands out because it\u2019s designed to do more than mask symptoms. Its ingredients are strategically chosen to support overall ear health, nourish the auditory nerves, and help fight the inflammation and oxidative stress that contribute to hearing loss. With a growing number of satisfied users, glowing testimonials, and rising popularity, Whispeara is quickly being recognized as one of the best natural alternatives to traditional hearing solutions. Its effectiveness is undeniable, and it's time for you to experience it. In this in-depth review, we\u2019ll explore why hearing loss is becoming so common, what makes Whispeara so effective, how it works inside the body, what real users are saying, and how it compares to similar products on the market. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll have all the information you need to decide whether Whispeara is the right choice to restore clarity, confidence, and quality of life. Why You\u2019re Struggling to Hear \u2013 Understanding the Root Causes Before delving into the functionality of Whispeara, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the intricate nature of hearing loss and tinnitus. These are not simple mechanical issues of 'old ears,' as commonly perceived. The causes are multifaceted, ranging from neurological interference to cellular inflammation. Your ears often bear the brunt of a breakdown in communication between your brain, nerves, and auditory pathways. The Brain-Ear Disconnect One of the most overlooked causes of hearing problems is a breakdown in the brain\u2019s ability to interpret sound signals. Sound isn\u2019t just heard through the ears\u2014it\u2019s processed and understood in the brain. The brain plays a crucial role in not just receiving sound signals, but also in interpreting and making sense of them. Over time, due to aging, oxidative damage, or toxin exposure, this processing system can become sluggish or distorted. This is why many people with age-related hearing loss say they can hear sounds, but can\u2019t understand them. It\u2019s not a problem with loudness\u2014it\u2019s a problem with clarity. Whispeara plays a pivotal role in addressing this critical disconnect. It supports the neurological pathways that carry sound signals from the ear to the brain. By enhancing nerve communication, it has the potential to restore sharper interpretation of sound and improve speech comprehension in noisy environments. This offers hope for those struggling with hearing issues. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Every day, your ears are exposed to oxidative stress caused by free radicals\u2014unstable molecules that damage cells over time. This damage affects the tiny hair cells inside your cochlea that are responsible for detecting sound vibrations. Once these cells are destroyed, they don\u2019t regenerate, making prevention and protection critical. In addition, chronic inflammation in the auditory system can reduce blood flow to the inner ear, choke off nerve endings, and hinder the repair of damaged tissues. Together, oxidative stress and inflammation form the silent villains behind progressive hearing loss. Many of the ingredients in Whispeara are rich in antioxidants and natural anti-inflammatory agents. These work to neutralize free radicals and support circulation to the inner ear, creating a more hospitable environment for sound transmission and nerve health. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors Daily habits can also accelerate hearing decline. Loud environments, constant earbud use, poor nutrition, smoking, unmanaged stress, and even dehydration can all compromise ear health. These factors can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to the auditory system. Add in factors like earwax buildup, past infections, or exposure to toxins, and it becomes clear that hearing loss is rarely due to a single issue\u2014it\u2019s usually the result of a cascade of damaging influences. What\u2019s worse, the onset is often so gradual that many people don\u2019t realize how much they\u2019ve lost until it\u2019s too late. Conversations become harder to follow, high-pitched sounds vanish, and that faint ringing or buzzing sound\u2014tinnitus\u2014starts to become more frequent and persistent. Whispeara was meticulously developed with all these contributing factors in mind. Its comprehensive formula is designed to support the full auditory ecosystem. From cellular repair and nerve protection to circulatory enhancement and brain connectivity, Whispeara is a holistic solution that instills confidence in both prevention and recovery from hearing issues. Don\u2019t Wait\u2014Grab Whispeara Now for Natural Hearing Support What is Whispeara? A Full Breakdown of the Formula and Its Origins Whispeara isn\u2019t just another generic supplement on the market\u2014it\u2019s a precision-formulated natural hearing support formula designed to help restore auditory clarity, reduce tinnitus, and protect long-term ear and brain health. But what exactly is it? And how did it come to stand out in a sea of overpromising products? Let\u2019s dive into the origin of Whispeara, what makes it unique, and why it\u2019s becoming the top choice for people seeking a natural path to sharper hearing. A Solution Born From Frustration According to Whispeara\u2019s official page, the formula was developed in response to a growing problem: millions of individuals suffering from progressive hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and deep frustration with conventional solutions like hearing aids, medications, or surgeries. The creators behind Whispeara recognized that many of the available options on the market failed to address the root causes of auditory decline. Hearing aids merely amplify sound\u2014they don\u2019t repair or protect. Prescription medications often treat symptoms with a laundry list of side effects. And surgical options, while occasionally effective, are both expensive and invasive. Whispeara, in contrast, was formulated to be simple, non-invasive, and accessible to everyone. It was built on the philosophy that restoring hearing requires supporting the full system\u2014ear, brain, and nerve health\u2014not just amplifying external sounds. This approach is designed to provide relief and comfort to those struggling with hearing issues. A Comprehensive, Multi-Stage Approach Whispeara\u2019s standout feature lies in its multi-layered formula. Rather than focusing on just one element of ear health, the supplement takes a holistic view, providing a comprehensive solution that addresses various aspects of hearing health. This is designed to reassure the audience of the thoroughness of the product. Detoxification : Helps cleanse the auditory system from toxins and oxidative stressors that disrupt inner ear and brain communication. Repair and Nourishment : Delivers essential nutrients to rebuild and support the delicate structures of the ear and auditory nerves. Neural Activation : Enhances brain-ear communication by supporting cognitive clarity and neurotransmitter function involved in processing sound. Inflammation Defense : Includes anti-inflammatory agents to reduce swelling and increase circulation in the auditory system. This full-spectrum support is what separates Whispeara from many single-function hearing formulas that may only target tinnitus or ear circulation. Why Whispeara is Gaining Momentum As more people search for effective, affordable, and natural ways to manage their hearing challenges, Whispeara has quickly become one of the most trusted options available. Its rise in popularity isn\u2019t just due to smart marketing\u2014it\u2019s because the product offers a comprehensive alternative to the limitations of traditional hearing interventions. In fact, the product is often referred to as the best natural hearing support formula available in 2025, thanks to its carefully researched blend of ingredients, its non-habit-forming design, and its commitment to long-term hearing wellness. From individuals in their 40s starting to experience early signs of hearing decline, to seniors who are tired of relying on clunky, uncomfortable hearing devices, Whispeara is proving to be a welcome, empowering solution. And as we\u2019ll see in the next section, the formula behind it is more than just impressive\u2014it\u2019s rooted in science. Order Whispeara Today and Start Hearing the World Clearly Again Inside the Formula \u2013 Ingredient Deep Dive At the heart of Whispeara\u2019s success is its carefully chosen blend of natural ingredients, each selected for its unique contribution to auditory health, neurological function, and cellular protection. This isn\u2019t a random cocktail of herbs\u2014it\u2019s a purpose-built formula designed to address hearing loss and tinnitus at the source. This emphasis on purposeful design is intended to instill confidence in the effectiveness of our product. Let\u2019s explore the core ingredients inside Whispeara and the science behind how each one contributes to better hearing, reduced ringing, and long-term ear-brain harmony. The Science of Hearing Support Compounds Unlike standard hearing supplements that rely on just a few generic ingredients, Whispeara combines over a dozen nutrients, antioxidants, and plant extracts. These ingredients work synergistically to protect the auditory nerves, improve blood flow to the inner ear, and reduce inflammation that interferes with sound processing. Key components include: Moomiyo: The Unique Adaptogen for Cellular Vitality Research by Shakirov (2021), Ivanov (2020), and Kolesnikov (2019) has shown that Moomiyo (also known as Shilajit) plays a powerful role as a natural adaptogen with multi-system support capabilities. It enhances immune function, modulates inflammatory responses, and increases physical resilience\u2014all of which are crucial for the maintenance of cochlear health and inner ear function. Within Whispeara, Moomiyo stands out as a foundational antioxidant, uniquely contributing to the detoxification of the auditory system, support for ear canal detox, and reduction of cumulative stress that leads to age-related hearing decline. As a keystone botanical, Moomiyo's deep cellular restoration potential elevates Whispeara above the status quo of ear health supplements. Alpha-GPC: The Cognitive Enhancer for Brain-Ear Synchronization Studies by Kato et al. (2021), Canal et al. (1991), Gatti et al. (2011), and Parker et al. (2015) underscore the impact of Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC) on neurotransmitter support, cognitive clarity, and neuroplasticity. In Whispeara, Alpha-GPC plays a crucial role in the restoration of hearing clarity by optimizing acetylcholine transmission, a key neurotransmitter in the auditory cortex. This nutrient supports both the processing speed of auditory signals and mood regulation, helping to address the mental fog and frustration often linked with tinnitus and hearing loss. Sangiorgi et al. (1994) even noted its promise in managing cognitive decline, placing Whispeara in a class of neuro-hearing protection formulas rather than just a basic supplement. GABA: The Neural Soother for Tinnitus and Auditory Overload Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), supported by Smith et al. (2018) and Lee et al. (2017), is the brain\u2019s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, essential for calming hyperactive nerve signals. In cases of tinnitus and auditory fatigue, dysregulated excitatory activity is common. Whispeara's use of GABA is instrumental in soothing overactive auditory pathways, promoting tranquility in the brain\u2019s hearing centers. This mechanism is a key component of Whispeara\u2019s tinnitus formula, helping to reduce ringing, buzzing, and static noise\u2014a benefit often echoed in real reviews of Whispeara. Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa): Neuromotor and Auditory Enhancement Gupta et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020) highlight L-Dopa extracted from Mucuna Pruriens as a dopaminergic precursor vital for neuroregeneration and motor response. In hearing, dopamine helps modulate synaptic strength in auditory nerve fibers, particularly those that relay sound intensity and pitch. By including L-Dopa, Whispeara reinforces the brain-ear connection, improves response to environmental sound stimuli, and supports neurotransmitter balance. This compound is especially important in addressing age-related hearing decline and supplements that improve auditory signals. L-Arginine: The Vascular Booster for Inner Ear Circulation According to Wu et al. (2016) and Bescos et al. (2012), L-Arginine is a nitric oxide precursor that enhances vascular dilation, thereby improving blood flow to inner ear structures. Good circulation is essential for delivering nutrients and oxygen to the cochlea and surrounding tissues. Whispeara\u2019s use of L-Arginine supports inner ear function, enhances auditory clarity, and contributes to ear health supplements that work by facilitating microvascular repair and nutrient transport\u2014elements that are crucial in hearing improvement through supplements. L-Tyrosine: Resilience Under Cognitive Load L-Tyrosine, as studied by Deijen et al. (2000) and Neri et al. (2015), is a precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine, making it vital for stress resilience and focus under pressure. For individuals with hearing challenges, especially in loud or chaotic environments, the brain\u2019s ability to focus and filter sound is often impaired. By incorporating L-Tyrosine, Whispeara enhances auditory concentration, combats cognitive fatigue, and supports neuro-auditory pathways\u2014making it a key player in the formula\u2019s ability to restore hearing naturally and promote hearing clarity support. Detox, Repair, and Restore Each capsule of Whispeara is designed to perform three key functions, ensuring comprehensive auditory health: Detoxify the auditory system \u2013 clearing buildup and neutralizing toxins that interfere with hearing. Rebuild and nourish \u2013 supporting healthy ear tissue, hair cells, and nerves. Improve neural connections \u2013 enhancing the way your brain interprets sound signals sent from the ear. This is especially important for individuals experiencing high-pitched ringing, buzzing, or static-like noise in the ears. Tinnitus often stems from miscommunication between damaged nerves and the auditory cortex. Whispeara's formula helps soothe this interference by calming inflammation and re-establishing clear nerve pathways. All-Natural, Non-Habit-Forming, and Easy to Use Whispeara stands out from other supplements in its category. It\u2019s not a synthetic compound or a pharmaceutical-grade chemical. Instead, it's a gentle, non-habit-forming, and all-natural solution for auditory health. Every ingredient is included in clinically supported dosages and manufactured in a facility that follows strict quality control practices. Whispeara is not just safe, but also inclusive. It\u2019s vegetarian-friendly, gluten-free, and free from GMOs or artificial additives\u2014making it a safe choice for most individuals looking for an all-natural path to restored hearing. This emphasis on inclusivity is designed to make our potential customers feel catered to and considered in our product design. Say Goodbye to Ringing\u2014Buy Whispeara While Supplies Last How Whispeara Works in the Body Hearing is more than just what your ears pick up\u2014it\u2019s what your brain understands. Whispeara was uniquely formulated not just to enhance the ears, but to restore the entire hearing system, including the neurological connections that interpret sound. This innovative, multi-step internal approach is what sets Whispeara apart from temporary fixes like hearing aids or masking devices, and it's sure to pique your interest. Rather than amplifying noise, Whispeara helps the body work better\u2014clearing pathways, reducing inflammation, and optimizing the transmission of sound from the ears to the brain.Here\u2019s how the process unfolds. The 3-Stage Process of Hearing Restoration Whispeara follows a phased biological process that mirrors the body\u2019s own repair mechanisms. Its ingredients work in unison through the following stages, providing a natural and reassuring path to hearing restoration: Stage 1: Detoxification and Ear Cleansing Whispeara begins by targeting the toxic buildup that often blocks optimal auditory function. Environmental pollutants, heavy metals, synthetic chemicals, and even chronic stress can introduce toxins into the bloodstream. These can interfere with nerve signaling and cause inflammation in the inner ear. Whispeara\u2019s antioxidant-rich ingredients like green tea extract and hawthorn berry go to work clearing this cellular debris, reducing oxidative stress, and refreshing the delicate tissues responsible for sound detection. Stage 2: Repair and Nutritional Rebuilding Once the environment is cleared, the next phase focuses on strengthening the physical structures involved in hearing. This includes the cochlea, auditory nerves, and neuro-auditory pathways. Critical vitamins like B6, B12, and niacin nourish the nerve sheaths and restore signaling potential, while magnesium and zinc support tissue repair and cellular renewal. This rebuilding stage is vital not just for people dealing with gradual hearing loss, but also those suffering from tinnitus\u2014often caused by inflammation or breakdown in the auditory nerve network. Stage 3: Brain-Ear Signal Optimization The final step in Whispeara\u2019s process is to enhance communication between the ears and the brain. Many people with hearing issues report that they \u201chear\u201d but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand.\u201d That\u2019s because the ear captures sound, but the brain deciphers it. When that system is out of sync, confusion, echoing, or muffled hearing can occur. Whispeara supports cognitive clarity through ingredients like ginkgo biloba, which improves blood flow to brain regions responsible for auditory processing. As signal clarity improves, users often report that voices sound sharper, environmental noises are less distorted, and concentration improves\u2014especially in noisy environments like restaurants or group conversations. For instance, users may find it easier to follow conversations in a crowded room or enjoy music without distortion. Long-Term Auditory Health Support This 3-phase cycle isn\u2019t just a short-term fix\u2014it\u2019s designed to build long-term resilience in your auditory system. Regular use of Whispeara can help protect against future decline, support better cognitive function, and preserve the quality of life that comes from clear, confident hearing. This long-term support is sure to give you hope for a better hearing future. Unlike conventional options that focus on one aspect of hearing, such as amplifying sound or reducing tinnitus, Whispeara offers a full-system upgrade: cleansing, rebuilding, and optimizing your body\u2019s natural hearing process\u2014without the need for batteries, invasive procedures, or discomfort. This comprehensive approach sets Whispeara apart from temporary fixes like hearing aids or masking devices, which often provide short-term relief without addressing the underlying issues. Benefits You Can Expect \u2013 From Silence to Clarity Whispeara isn\u2019t just about protecting hearing\u2014it\u2019s about restoring a richer, fuller sensory experience that many people haven\u2019t felt in years. Whether you\u2019re dealing with mild tinnitus, significant hearing decline, or just want to stay ahead of age-related auditory deterioration, Whispeara delivers a broad spectrum of benefits that go far beyond simple sound amplification. Here\u2019s a detailed look at what users can expect\u2014physically, emotionally, and mentally\u2014when taking Whispeara regularly. Immediate and Long-Term Results While every body responds differently, many users report subtle improvements within the first few weeks. This often includes a reduction in the volume or frequency of ringing in the ears, better clarity in everyday conversations, and a noticeable sense of \u201ccalm\u201d in the auditory field. As the detox and repair phases of Whispeara\u2019s process take hold, more profound changes can occur: Improved word recognition \u2013 No more \u201cHuh?\u201d or \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d moments during conversations. Less audio distortion \u2013 Sounds become crisper and easier to isolate, even in noisy environments like restaurants or crowded events. Enhanced sound localization \u2013 You\u2019ll be able to better determine where sounds are coming from, which improves situational awareness. More restful sleep \u2013 Especially for those dealing with constant ringing or buzzing that interrupts rest. Over time, with consistent use, Whispeara may help restore the body\u2019s natural auditory processing abilities, reduce nerve inflammation, and protect against further decline. The goal isn\u2019t just symptom relief\u2014it\u2019s whole-system balance. Tinnitus and Ringing Relief One of the most common reasons people turn to Whispeara is to manage tinnitus\u2014the persistent ringing, buzzing, hissing, or pulsing noise that originates in the ears or brain. Tinnitus isn\u2019t just irritating; it can be mentally exhausting, interfere with sleep, and make everyday life stressful. Whispeara understands this and is here to provide relief. Whispeara approaches tinnitus not as a standalone problem, but as a symptom of underlying inflammation and neurological misfiring. By targeting the root causes through its anti-inflammatory and nerve-calming ingredients like garlic extract, magnesium, and vitamin B complex, many users have reported a significant reduction in their tinnitus volume and frequency. While there is no known \u201ccure\u201d for chronic tinnitus, Whispeara offers a realistic and science-backed path to meaningful relief. Support for Age-Related Hearing Decline Hearing loss due to aging\u2014also known as presbycusis\u2014is a slow, progressive condition that impacts millions. It typically begins with difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds or understanding speech in noisy environments and gradually worsens over time. Whispeara addresses the most common contributors to age-related hearing loss: oxidative stress, blood flow reduction, and nerve signal degradation. With consistent use, the supplement supports better oxygen and nutrient delivery to the ears and brain, helping seniors stay sharp and socially engaged for longer. Instead of waiting for your hearing to deteriorate past the point of no return, Whispeara offers proactive protection and maintenance. It's about taking control of your auditory health and ensuring a better quality of life. Overall Auditory Clarity and Focus It\u2019s not just about hearing sounds\u2014it\u2019s about understanding them clearly. Whispeara improves auditory clarity by supporting both the mechanical and neurological sides of hearing. As blood flow improves and inflammation reduces, your brain processes sound more efficiently, reducing mental fatigue and increasing comprehension. This clarity translates to better focus, stronger memory, and reduced strain in social interactions\u2014something users often describe as \u201cgetting their life back.\u201d Real Stories, Real Relief \u2013 What Users Are Saying While science and formulation are crucial, nothing validates a product like real experiences from everyday people. Whispeara has been gaining a strong reputation through word-of-mouth and verified customer feedback\u2014not just for what it promises, but for what it delivers. People across age groups and backgrounds have shared their personal stories of frustration turned into relief, and silence replaced by clarity. Here\u2019s a closer look at what users are saying about Whispeara, and how this natural supplement has made a real difference in their daily lives. Verified Testimonials from Everyday Users Many individuals turn to Whispeara as a last resort\u2014after trying hearing aids, sound machines, or other supplements that just didn\u2019t help. What they discover instead is often described as surprising, even life-changing, sparking a sense of hope and intrigue in potential users. \u201cI was skeptical at first, but after about three weeks on Whispeara, the buzzing in my ears began to fade.

Hear Every Word Again\u2014Act Fast, Get Whispeara Today Safety, Side Effects & Suitability When choosing any supplement\u2014especially one targeting something as delicate as hearing\u2014safety is a top concern. Whispeara positions itself not only as effective, but also as gentle, natural, and free of the typical side effects seen with pharmaceuticals or invasive procedures. This natural and gentle approach should provide users with a sense of reassurance and peace of mind. So what should users know before getting started? Let\u2019s explore Whispeara\u2019s safety profile, any potential side effects, and who is best suited to take it. Designed for Daily Use Without Dependency Whispeara is formulated with a blend of plant-based extracts, essential vitamins, and minerals \u2014with no synthetic stimulants, artificial chemicals, or habit-forming substances . The product is non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, and manufactured in a facility that adheres to strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards. This attention to purity makes it ideal for long-term use. Unlike hearing aids, which require constant upkeep, or prescription drugs that may lead to side effects or tolerance over time, Whispeara is designed to integrate seamlessly into your daily wellness regimen with minimal risk. Users report that the supplement is easy on the stomach , especially when taken with a meal, and most experience no adverse effects at all \u2014even after extended use. What About Side Effects? While Whispeara is generally very well-tolerated, it\u2019s important to consider that every individual responds differently to supplements. A small number of users may experience mild side effects during the first few days as their body adjusts. These may include: Light digestive discomfort Temporary increase in awareness of ear sensitivity (as circulation improves) Slight headache or fatigue during detox phase These effects are typically short-lived and can often be mitigated by staying hydrated and taking the supplement after meals. If symptoms persist, it\u2019s always wise to consult a healthcare provider. Who Should Use Whispeara? Whispeara is intended for adults experiencing hearing concerns , such as: Gradual or sudden hearing decline Ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments Age-related auditory fatigue Long-term ear health support It\u2019s especially ideal for those who: Want a non-invasive, natural solution Are not ready for or dissatisfied with hearing aids Are seeking a preventative measure for long-term auditory health Who Should Consult a Doctor First? While Whispeara is safe for most adults, there are certain groups who should seek medical guidance before beginning any new supplement: Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions (especially neurological or circulatory) Those currently taking prescription medications , particularly blood thinners or neuroregulators Pregnant or breastfeeding women Anyone under the age of 18 Whispeara is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It should be viewed as a supportive wellness tool , not a substitute for professional medical treatment or hearing care services. Peace of Mind with a Satisfaction Guarantee One of the strongest endorsements of Whispeara\u2019s safety and trustworthiness is the company\u2019s 100% satisfaction guarantee . This guarantee provides users with the peace of mind that they can try the product risk-free for several months, with a full refund available if they\u2019re not satisfied with the results. This customer-first policy speaks to the brand\u2019s confidence in both the safety and performance of its formula, giving users a sense of security and confidence in their purchase. Comparing Whispeara to the Competition The natural supplement market is overflowing with products that claim to support hearing, brain function, or both. Butnot all supplements are created equal. Many are underdosed, poorly formulated, or focused on general wellness rather than the specific causes of hearing decline. Whispeara, however, sets itself apart through its clarity, focus, and performance\u2014and a comparison with other popular formulas makes that crystal clear. A Sharper Focus on Hearing One of the most noticeable differences between Whispeara and alternatives like Quietum Plus, Cortexi, and Synapse XT is its unique focus . While Whispeara was developed specifically for auditory restoration , many competing products take a broader, less defined approach. This distinct focus of Whispeara reassures you that it's designed to address your specific needs. Quietum Plus, for example, includes a variety of herbal ingredients, but its focus is spread across stress management, circulation, and hormonal support\u2014not strictly on ear health. Cortexi markets itself heavily as a cognitive and metabolic enhancer, not a hearing-specific formula. Synapse XT is designed primarily to promote mental clarity and brain function, with minimal direct action on auditory pathways or inner ear support. Whispeara\u2019s mission is different. Every ingredient is included to serve the ear-brain connection \u2014to detoxify the auditory system, reduce inflammation, improve signal clarity, and support nerve repair. This hearing-first philosophy makes it a more targeted and effective option for those struggling with hearing loss or tinnitus. Ingredient Transparency and Quality Another key differentiator is transparency . Whispeara clearly lists its ingredients and their dosages on the product page, so users know exactly what they\u2019re putting into their body. This kind of openness is rare. Many other supplements hide their formulations behind vague \"proprietary blends,\" which means you don\u2019t know how much of each ingredient you're getting\u2014or whether it\u2019s enough to be effective. In contrast, Whispeara\u2019s formulation is backed by clinical research and real-world user outcomes . Each component is selected for its proven benefits, and the dosages align with levels shown in studies to produce results. The inclusion of ingredients like hawthorn berry, garlic extract, B-vitamins, ginkgo biloba, magnesium, and niacin provides support across multiple systems\u2014auditory, neural, vascular, and cognitive\u2014without relying on synthetic fillers, stimulants, or artificial compounds. Customer Experiences Speak Louder Than Labels Beyond formulations, the most compelling evidence comes from the people who\u2019ve actually used the products. Many users report disappointment with competing supplements, saying they either didn\u2019t notice any real changes or felt the results were too subtle to justify the cost. Whispeara\u2019s customers, however, tend to express satisfaction with their noticeable results \u2014often within the first few weeks. Tinnitus relief, improved conversation clarity, and a greater sense of peace and mental sharpness are among the most commonly shared outcomes. This high level of user satisfaction should give you confidence in Whispeara's effectiveness. The fact that many Whispeara users go on to reorder and recommend the product is another major advantage\u2014it\u2019s not just being bought, it\u2019s being trusted. Value for Your Investment When comparing cost, most hearing supplements land in a similar price range. But Whispeara stands out for what you\u2019re actually receiving. Not only is the formula more targeted and potent, but it also comes with a generous money-back guarantee that gives users plenty of time to try it risk-free. This value for money makes Whispeara a wise investment in your health. For those looking to stock up, multi-bottle bundles bring the price down considerably, and the brand offers periodic discounts that make it one of the more accessible premium formulas available. Why Whispeara Wins To put it simply, Whispeara is designed specifically for people who want to support, restore, and protect their hearing \u2014not just boost brain power or overall wellness. Its focus, transparency, positive user outcomes, and strong refund policy make it the clear leader in the natural hearing support space. If you\u2019ve tried other supplements and walked away disappointed, Whispeara could be the one that actually delivers. How to Use Whispeara for Best Results One of the most comforting aspects of Whispeara is its simplicity in becoming a part of your daily routine. There are no complex programs, no messy drops, no external devices to manage\u2014just two capsules a day. But like any supplement, consistency and proper usage are key to experiencing its full range of benefits. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to get the most out of Whispeara. Simple, Effective Dosage The recommended dosage for Whispeara is two capsules per day , preferably taken with a meal and a glass of water. This ensures proper absorption of fat-soluble nutrients and reduces the chance of mild stomach discomfort, which can sometimes occur when taking any supplement on an empty stomach. Some users prefer taking both capsules in the morning for an early mental and auditory boost, while others split the dose\u2014one with breakfast and one with dinner\u2014for sustained support throughout the day. Either method is effective, so it\u2019s more about what fits your lifestyle best. When Will You Start to Notice Results? While some people report subtle changes within the first few days\u2014such as a decrease in tinnitus intensity or feeling more \u201cpresent\u201d in conversations\u2014 Whispeara is not a quick fix . It\u2019s a formula designed to repair, restore, and protect hearing over time. For most users, noticeable improvements begin around the 2- to 4-week mark , especially when it comes to clarity, ringing reduction, and ear sensitivity. The detoxification and repair stages typically take place in the first month. Continued use for 60 to 90 days tends to deliver deeper, more long-lasting changes in auditory health and overall cognitive performance. That\u2019s why the company recommends purchasing a multi-month supply, particularly for those with moderate to severe hearing concerns. Tips for Maximizing Your Results To get the most out of your Whispeara experience, here are a few best practices to follow: Take it consistently \u2013 Missing doses can delay your progress. Try setting a reminder if needed. Stay hydrated \u2013 Water helps the body flush out toxins and supports circulation to the ears and brain. Pair with healthy habits \u2013 Reduce exposure to loud environments, use ear protection when necessary, and avoid excessive use of earbuds or headphones. Get enough sleep \u2013 Proper rest supports neurological repair and recovery, which enhances the effects of hearing support supplements. Be patient \u2013 Natural restoration takes time. Whispeara is working behind the scenes to recalibrate your body, reduce inflammation, and optimize neural pathways. Can You Stack It With Other Supplements? Yes. Whispeara is generally safe to take alongside other wellness supplements such as multivitamins, omega-3s, or memory-support formulas. This safety aspect is designed to reassure you. However, if you\u2019re using medications\u2014especially those that affect blood flow, neurological health, or inflammation\u2014it\u2019s wise to consult your healthcare provider just to be sure there are no interactions. What\u2019s important is that Whispeara doesn\u2019t rely on stimulants or sedatives, making it safe for both daytime and evening use, without the risk of jitters, crashes, or dependency. In summary, Whispeara was designed to be as convenient as it is effective. Just two capsules a day may be all it takes to start hearing better, thinking more clearly, and finally feeling like yourself again. This convenience is meant to put you at ease and make the process more comfortable.

Now, with Epomaker's Magforce 68, the company has been able to integrate compactness, design, and quality all in a single package, and this particular keyboard is what I would call one of the best options out there if you are looking for something \"small.\" Epomaker Magforce 68 - Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro Switches, Hall Effect Technology & Speedy Type-C Connection Well, in the keyboards segment, there are really many 65% layout options that are said to be something a hardcore gamer would prefer, and Epomaker probably had these in mine before designing the Magforce 68. For someone like me whose work performance revolves around having a decent keyboard, my experience with this keyboard has been a charm. While the \"compactness\" hasn't appealed to me much, the typing quality is simply something that I am sure every purchaser will appreciate. Related Story Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives Thinks Trump Has Taken \u201cThe Doomsday Scenario Off The Table\u201d And Tech Stocks Will Rally Come Monday, But One Options Market Veteran Feels \u201cIt\u2019s A Crowded Trade\u201d For a quick rundown of Epomaker Magforce 68 specifications, it features the Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro switches, which we'll discuss extensively ahead of time, along with a CNC aluminum body and much more. Here's a summary of the keyboard's features/specifications: Specification Details Brand EPOMAKER Model Magforce 68 Layout 65% ANSI US Layout Number of Keys 68 keys Connectivity Type-C Wired Compatibility WIN Case Material Aluminum Finish Anodized Flex-Cut No Flex-Cut Mounting Structure Top-Mount Plate Material FR4 PCB Thickness 1.6mm Stabilizers Plate-Mount Stabilizer Typing Angle 7 degree Sound Dampening Poron Sandwich Foam, Bottom Foam, Bottom EVA Keycaps Profile Cherry Profile Keycaps Material PBT Plastic Keycaps Manufacturing Technique Double-Shot RGB South-facing, per-key RGB Polling Rate 8000Hz Scan Rate 32kHz per key Latency 0.125ms (USB) Anti-Ghosting N-Key Rollover Keyboard Dimensions 314.5 * 113.9 * 38.6 mm Keyboard Weight 1.5kg Package Weight About 2kg Epomaker Magforce 68 - Unboxing & Close-Up The packaging of the keyboard is undoubtedly creative, as the box features a black and blue-themed design, with the branding at the very front. When you open up the box, there's cushioning on both the top and the bottom, which means that the company has ensured that the unit doesn't get damaged when shipping it across different regions. Inside the box, you get the standard manual, a Type-C USB cable, and a keycap puller, which is pretty standard for every keyboard. You also get extra Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro switches in case a replacement is needed, which might come in handy. When I saw the keyboard for the first time, I started to think about the unit's compactness, since I could almost carry its weight entirely at the palm of my hands. That is indeed the beauty of a 65% layout, since not only does it make portability much easier, but it occupies a little space on your desk, which means that you can use the extra space left for something else. But, you do get void of elements such as a dedicated numpad, so it is more of a consumer choice in the end. Starting with the keycaps come in a cherry profile design, which is the common notion in the segment. They are made out of PBT Plastic, which not only is a sturdy material but also ensures that there are no thumbprint impressions on the keycaps after extensive use, and I did notice this after using the keyboard for several days. Another interesting factor about the Magforce 68 is its sound-dampening mechanism, which uses Poron Sandwich Foam as the main cushion, creating that \"crisp\" typing sound. Epomaker Magforce 68 - Design Language, Hall Effect Technology & Gateron Magnetic Switches One thing about the keyboard that makes it a bit weird is the design language. The overall vibe of the product is seen as something \"minimalistic\" and more professional-oriented, but switching on the RGB makes the design layout complicated. Apart from this, the RGB really strikes out when you look at it for the very first time, and a more \"diffused\" look would have been a better choice, like the Galaxy100 counterpart. One of the standout features of the Magforce 68 is the \"Hall Effect\" technology, which uses a magnetic field to detect keystrokes, providing a smoother and quieter experience. Here's how Epomaker describes it: This feature allows users to fine-tune the actuation distance, catering to specific gaming or typing preferences. The Snap Tap function ensures rapid keystroke registration, while the Dead Zone adjustment eliminates unintended inputs, providing unparalleled control. This level of customization, powered by magnetic switches, ensures that every keystroke is accurate and consistent, enhancing performance across various use cases. So, consumers of different segments could easily fine-tune the actuation distance to get the desired typing experience, which really opens up the Magforce 68 to several types of users. You can utilize Epomaker's cloud adjustment platform to fine-tune the keyboard's performance. Speaking of the onboard switches, the Epomaker Magforce 68 comes with the widely-known Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro, a magnetic linear switch popular for their \"cracky\" sound, similar to Mahjong tiles clicking together. They come with a travel distance of 3.5mm with a lifespan of over 100 million keystrokes. These switches are primarily used in keyboards supporting the Hall Effect technology and are widely used by a variety of keyboard integrators. Since switches are a personal preference, I won't comment much on them, apart from the fact that if you don't like a \"cracky-sounded\" keyboard, the Magforce 68 isn't for you. Epomaker Magforce 68 Conclusion - Ideal Option If Compact & High-Performing Keyboard Is Your Need This particular keyboard is one of the best options in a 65% layout segment, but it comes with a hefty price tag of $159.99, which might seem justified if you look at the specifications alone. If you are eager to purchase the Epomaker Magforce 68, you can refer to the company's official website here and enjoy a great experience. 8.5 WCCFTECH RATING The Epomaker Magforce 68 is a great option for consumers looking for a compact keyboard option that features a great typing experience. Combined with the Hall Effect technology, the Magforce 68 is suited for many consumers out there.

It has (mostly) been all I have needed. Now that 10 support is ending, I was thinking of what I may use next, but really don't want have to go through the Windows installation which I found a nightmare! I am looking at this can anyone offer advice/opinions? The Amazon description seems rather lacking especially in the O.S. area and I wouldn't want to end up with having to buy and install my own copy of Windows! \ud83d\ude44 Thanks.

Back to top #4 six-h six-h Topic Starter Members 450 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: North West England Local time: 07:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 01:31 PM @Cat Herder I agree, they are brilliant. I have been an Intel fan for many years but have a sneaky feeling that AMD currently give better bang for the bucks. Since my desire is to gain entry to the W11 party without the graft of installation, the lack of detail on the proffered OS is a deal breaker. Just wondering if there are any Beelink aficionado's here who can clarify just what we would likely receive, seems from the responses on the \"hotukdeals site\" even the dratted model is also now in dispute!! Back to top #5 six-h six-h Topic Starter Members 450 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: North West England Local time: 07:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 01:34 PM Thanks @PhillPower2, so that's a \"No\"! Back to top #6 ranchhand_ ranchhand_ Members 5,719 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: Midwest Local time: 12:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 02:09 PM You asked for an evaluation, but have not detailed exactly you want to use this for, so this cripples any responses. The specs are good, and the Ryzen9 CPU is a top-contender. I have built 2 desktops using the Ryzen7 and 32 gigs RAM and they jet through programs on Windows 11. I am about ready to start a new build using the Ryzen7, that's how much I like AMD. If you are going to use it only for streaming videos, watching movies and surfing the internet to shopping sites, etc. the specs are fine. Note what it is intended for with the amount of RAM that is devoted to graphical interface, about half of the 32gigs. So...if you run heavy duty programs such as video editing & creation, this is going to slow down a lot. I am a bit careful because Amazon lists only 15 ratings, and out of those only 5 users actually posted in with reviews. They claim as follows: \" 89% positive ratings from 200+ customers \" but I don't see those Amazon ratings. They claim this is a gaming machine. I seriously doubt that, unless childrens', low-overhead games that I am sure you would not be interested in are played. They claim this will run Photoshop. Well, ok, maybe only if it comes with Windows11 (not spec'd) and it will run very slow-w-w-w-w. What I don't like is that it appears not to come with an OS, or with one unspecified. Possibly using Linux? That's a deal-breaker for me. Here in the USA Amazon gives a 30-day return period for almost any reason, postage paid. If you have that in the UK then you are pretty safe. Really work the bejabbers out of it immediately to have it prove itself. Honestly, I would pass on it. Edited by ranchhand_, Yesterday, 02:12 PM.

You have more or less summed up my intended usage, but I do do quite a lot of Photo manipulation with Elements 2019 and some Video work using Shotcut which my current Intel i5 based NUC manages reasonably quickly though I suspect My demands are few since it achieves all I require with only 8GB of DDR4 ! The total confusion around this Amazon offer leads me to believe that it will not be the specification we think it will be. Returning may also be disappointing since we pay the import duty and tax up front and I suspect that may not be refundable. Think I'll wait for something a little less nebulous!

I take your point and also the advice of @PhillPower2 and will \"step away\" from that deal! I think I'll wait and see if there are any good deals during the year. Having always had Intel based machines before, I fancy AMD Ryzen are perhaps better value/faster these days. I've lived with this NUCi5SYH machine with 8GB DDR4 which has been capable of satisfying most of my needs despite having the OS Trashed by Microsoft's engineers who Naused up their attempt to create \"Libraries\" for me and I ended up with two folders with exactly the same content, ...everything that was on the dratted machine! So traumatised was I from doing the original install, I couldn't face doing it again to correct their mistake. That's why I really need my next machine to have W11 preinstalled. Hopefully something will come along before W10 expires that will fit my fairly conservative needs.

Golden rule when asking for help with a new rig ( or even upgrading ) is to state your intended use and when possible your maximum budget, if we know your intended use we can do some research for you. Being honest I am a bit taken aback about your almost fear of installing Windows, it is far easier nowadays and especially when you think back to the days when you had to slipstream SATA drivers into Windows XP.

Introduction In an age where physical performance, mental clarity, and intimate vitality are becoming critical to men's overall health, the market for male enhancement supplements continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Whether it's due to age-related decline, chronic stress, or sedentary lifestyles, many men today face issues related to low stamina, diminished drive, and fluctuating testosterone levels. This surge in demand has led to an influx of quick-fix solutions and synthetic alternatives\u2014many of which underdeliver or include hidden subscriptions and questionable ingredients.

With a clean formulation, no hidden auto-shipments, and a 180-day money-back guarantee, Alpha Bites is rapidly earning its place as a trusted name in men's health.

It will also explore the specific pain points men face, how this supplement addresses them, and why it has become a standout performer among male enhancement supplements on the market today. Whether you're seeking improved energy, enhanced intimacy, or just a natural edge in your day-to-day performance, this article delivers everything you need to know\u2014accurately, thoroughly, and without the hype. If you're ready to take the next step towards improving your health and vitality, consider giving Alpha Bites a try. II. Understanding the Root of Male Performance Decline Declining male performance is a topic that is often met with silence, yet it impacts millions of men across age groups and lifestyles. The signs may begin subtly: lower energy levels, reduced interest in intimacy, difficulty maintaining stamina during physical or mental tasks, or even a loss of self-confidence. Over time, these issues can become persistent and disruptive, affecting not only personal health but also relationships, work performance, and emotional well-being. The Biological Causes of Performance Decline One of the most common causes of diminished male vitality is the natural decline in testosterone levels that begins as early as the late 20s or early 30s. Testosterone plays a central role in regulating muscle mass, bone density, libido, mood, and energy. As levels drop over time, men may experience a wide array of unwanted symptoms, including fatigue, mood swings, decreased libido, and even reduced cognitive sharpness. Additionally, poor blood flow\u2014a key factor in physical and sexual performance\u2014is often linked to sedentary habits, poor nutrition, and oxidative stress. As circulation worsens, the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to critical areas, including the brain and reproductive organs, is compromised. This leads to reduced performance and delayed recovery. Lifestyle and Psychological Factors Performance is not purely physical; it is tightly connected to mental resilience and emotional health. Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, and poor dietary choices create a vicious cycle that further depletes energy reserves and hormonal balance. Anxiety and low self-esteem also feed into the problem, often worsening physical symptoms through psychosomatic responses. Furthermore, many men are unaware that nutritional deficiencies\u2014especially in key compounds like nitric oxide precursors, adaptogenic herbs, and essential vitamins\u2014contribute to poor stamina and drive. The modern diet is often stripped of these performance-supporting nutrients, leaving many to rely on stimulants or ineffective over-the-counter options that do little more than mask symptoms. Why Most Solutions Fall Short The supplement industry is flooded with fast-acting pills and synthetic stimulants that promise instant results but often come with undesirable trade-offs\u2014crashes, side effects, and even hidden subscriptions that trap consumers into recurring charges. Many of these products are underdosed, loaded with filler ingredients, or built on unproven formulas lacking clinical research. What men need is not just a short-term fix but a strategic, natural solution that supports their body's systems holistically\u2014from hormones and circulation to stress resilience and cellular energy. This is where Alpha Bites steps in. In the next section, we'll examine why Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies have rapidly become a trusted product in the male health space, offering a complete and clinically grounded formula that targets the root causes of decline rather than merely covering up symptoms.

This section provides an in-depth examination of the core ingredients used in Alpha Bites, based on the official formulation listed on getalphabites.com , and explains how they work together to deliver measurable benefits. Each ingredient has been chosen based on its relevance to nitric oxide production, testosterone support, cognitive resilience, and overall male wellness. Let's take a closer look: 1. Catuaba Bark Extract (200 mg) Known in traditional Brazilian medicine for centuries, Catuaba bark is a natural aphrodisiac celebrated for its libido-enhancing effects.

Beet Root Powder (200 mg) Beets are a rich source of dietary nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide in the body\u2014a compound that supports vascular dilation and improved blood flow.

Benefit to users : Increases energy, libido, and stress resilience. Scientific connection : Clinical trials show improvements in mood, desire, and physical performance 4. Horny Goat Weed Extract (250 mg) Also known as Epimedium, this botanical contains icariin, a natural compound known for its phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitory activity.

Visit the official website: getalphabites.com Synergistic Effects and Formula Cohesion Unlike many products that stack ingredients haphazardly, Alpha Bites relies on intentional synergy.

Vitamin C ties the formula together by promoting cellular health and metabolic balance. There are no proprietary blends, which means users know precisely what they are consuming. This level of transparency is rare in the supplement space and underscores Alpha Bites' commitment to consumer trust. In the next section, we'll examine how these ingredients interact within the body and explore the science behind their combined effects on performance, vitality, and long-term health. V. How Alpha Bites Works: The Science Behind the Formula Understanding how Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies deliver results requires examining the interplay of hormonal regulation, circulatory function, and cellular resilience. Each ingredient in the formula plays a distinct role, but the power of Alpha Bites lies in how these components work together to support the male body holistically. 1. Enhancing Circulation Through Nitric Oxide Pathways At the core of male physical and sexual performance is healthy blood flow. Without adequate circulation, achieving and sustaining performance\u2014whether in the gym or the bedroom\u2014becomes increasingly complex. Alpha Bites leverages Beet Root Powder and Horny Goat Weed, both of which contribute to nitric oxide production and vascular dilation. Beet Root Powder provides a natural source of nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. This allows blood vessels to relax and expand, enhancing oxygen delivery to muscle tissue and intimate areas. Horny Goat Weed supports nitric oxide bioavailability while also acting as a PDE5 inhibitor, which can help maintain stronger, longer-lasting erections without pharmaceutical interference. By improving vascular tone and blood delivery, Alpha Bites helps optimize both physical endurance and intimate performance. 2. Supporting Natural Testosterone Levels Testosterone is a key hormone for male vitality, and Alpha Bites incorporates a three-pronged approach to supporting it naturally: Tribulus Terrestris supports testosterone synthesis and helps enhance the body's natural androgen response. Maca Extract is an adaptogen that indirectly supports hormonal balance by improving stress responses and overall endocrine function. Horny Goat Weed contains icariin, which has been shown in some studies to support testosterone signaling. While Alpha Bites does not contain synthetic testosterone or DHEA, it supports the body's own production and regulatory pathways, promoting balance rather than artificial spikes. 3. Addressing Stress and Mental Fatigue Performance is not just physical\u2014it is deeply tied to mental stamina, mood, and emotional resilience. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, which can interfere with testosterone and lead to symptoms like fatigue, reduced libido, and poor concentration. Maca Extract acts as a natural adaptogen to regulate stress and improve energy levels. Vitamin C helps lower oxidative stress and cortisol levels, contributing to a more stable mood and faster physical recovery. By targeting these underlying factors, Alpha Bites provides more than a temporary lift\u2014it helps rebuild a more balanced and energetic foundation for daily life. 4. Enhancing Libido and Sexual Desire Ingredients like Catuaba Bark and Maca have long-standing reputations in herbal medicine for their effects on sexual desire and arousal. These botanicals stimulate neurotransmitter activity and may help increase the frequency of spontaneous arousal and overall intimacy satisfaction. This effect is often enhanced by the circulatory benefits of Beet Root and Horny Goat Weed, which improve physical readiness during moments of intimacy. 5. Fast Absorption, Consistent Support Because Alpha Bites is delivered in gummy form, the active ingredients are absorbed more efficiently through the digestive tract compared to hard-pressed pills or tablets. This means faster action and better consistency in results over time. Used daily, Alpha Bites becomes a cumulative performance enhancer, supporting long-term energy, hormone health, stamina, and confidence\u2014without resorting to synthetic additives or crash-inducing stimulants. In the next section, we'll break down the specific, real-world benefits men are reporting from Alpha Bites, from energy and mood to libido and relationship satisfaction\u2014offering further insights into why this product stands out in the male enhancement supplement market. Don\u2019t Settle for Less\u2014Upgrade Your Stamina, Drive, and Confidence with Alpha Bites VI. The Benefits of Alpha Bites: What Users Can Expect While Alpha Bites is built on a foundation of natural ingredients and scientific theory, its actual value lies in the real, measurable benefits users experience when taken consistently. By addressing key biological, hormonal, and psychological factors affecting male vitality, Alpha Bites positions itself not only as a performance enhancer but also as a comprehensive male wellness support tool. Here's what men can realistically expect from incorporating Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies into their daily routine: 1. Increased Energy and Stamina The combination of Maca Root, Vitamin C, and Beet Root Powder supports mitochondrial energy production and improved blood circulation, which directly translates into increased physical stamina and reduced fatigue. Men report more energy throughout the day without relying on caffeine or stimulants. Physical endurance, particularly in exercise or athletic contexts, improves due to better oxygen delivery and muscular recovery. 2. Enhanced Libido and Sexual Drive Loss of desire can be one of the most demoralizing experiences for men, especially when it happens gradually. Alpha Bites helps restore sexual interest, responsiveness, and spontaneous desire by boosting both mental and physical readiness. Catuaba Bark and Maca Extract stimulate neurotransmitter activity linked to arousal. Improved blood flow heightens sensitivity and physical responsiveness. 3. Improved Erection Quality and Performance Thanks to the nitric oxide-boosting effects of Horny Goat Weed and Beet Root, many users notice improvements in erection firmness, duration, and frequency\u2014without the use of synthetic chemicals. Better circulation ensures that tissues receive adequate blood flow for optimal function. Men report increased confidence and reduced performance anxiety. 4. Hormonal Support and Testosterone Balance With ingredients like Tribulus Terrestris and Horny Goat Weed, Alpha Bites supports testosterone activity, helping men regain their natural hormonal edge. Benefits include improved muscle tone, greater physical resilience, and enhanced mood. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, Alpha Bites works with the body's systems. 5. Stress Relief and Mood Stability Men often overlook the role that stress and mental fatigue play in diminishing performance. Alpha Bites supports emotional wellness through ingredients that stabilize cortisol and support the nervous system. Maca's adaptogenic properties help improve focus and mood under pressure. Vitamin C reduces oxidative stress and inflammation that may contribute to fatigue and mood swings. 6. Confidence, Motivation, and Quality of Life Perhaps the most overlooked but vital benefit of Alpha Bites is the restoration of confidence . As energy returns, drive improves, and relationships strengthen, men report feeling like themselves again\u2014often even better. Improved vitality contributes to greater motivation and productivity. Enhanced performance leads to more satisfying personal and professional relationships. The cumulative effect of Alpha Bites is a total upgrade in the male experience\u2014from the gym to the bedroom and from the boardroom to day-to-day interactions. These aren't short-term bursts of energy but long-lasting improvements rooted in better biological balance and nourishment.

These mental health benefits are subtle but powerful contributors to overall performance. \"I feel more in control of my stress, and my focus has improved. This wasn't just about performance\u2014it's made a difference in my daily mindset.\" \u2013 Mike T., Verified Customer, Age 50 No Side Effects, No Gimmicks Unlike many male enhancement products that are plagued by negative feedback due to hidden subscriptions, synthetic stimulants, or unwanted side effects, Alpha Bites is consistently praised for its clean formulation and transparent business model. \"No weird side effects. No surprises on my credit card. Just a solid supplement that works when you use it daily.\" \u2013 Brian C., Verified Customer, Age 45 Testimonials as Social Proof The volume and consistency of positive reviews for Alpha Bites act as compelling social proof, reinforcing its positioning as one of the top-rated male enhancement gummies in 2025. The results are not exaggerated promises of overnight success but relatively steady, compounding improvements in performance, confidence, and well-being. In the next section, we'll examine how to use Alpha Bites effectively to achieve optimal results and provide tips for incorporating it into a holistic male health routine. VIII. How to Use Alpha Bites for Maximum Results While the formulation behind Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies is supported by science and user reviews, achieving optimal benefits depends on one crucial factor: consistency. Like any natural supplement, Alpha Bites is not intended to produce instant, pharmaceutical-like effects. Instead, it supports the body's internal systems over time, creating sustainable improvements in energy, hormonal balance, and performance. This section explains how to use Alpha Bites properly, what to expect at each stage of supplementation, and how to integrate the gummies into a broader lifestyle strategy for male health. Recommended Daily Dosage According to the manufacturer, the ideal usage protocol is: Take two Alpha Bites gummies once per day , preferably with food and water. Choose a consistent time of day (morning or early afternoon) to establish a routine. Do not exceed the suggested dosage, as the formulation has been calibrated for optimal efficacy at the recommended level. Short-Term vs Long-Term Results Alpha Bites is designed to support male health in both immediate and gradual ways: Within the first 1\u20132 weeks , many users report increased energy, mental clarity, and a noticeable uplift in stamina. By weeks 3\u20136 , improvements in mood, confidence, and libido tend to become more apparent. After 2\u20133 months , the effects may become more stable and profound\u2014particularly in hormonal balance, circulatory health, and overall vitality. For men over 40 or those with chronic fatigue or low testosterone symptoms, extended use (3\u20136 months) is encouraged to allow the adaptogenic and circulatory benefits to take full effect. Lifestyle Factors That Enhance Results To get the most from Alpha Bites, users are advised to complement supplementation with basic lifestyle principles: Stay hydrated : Water enhances nutrient absorption and supports circulation. Get adequate sleep : Hormonal restoration primarily occurs during deep sleep cycles. Exercise regularly : Even moderate physical activity supports blood flow, nitric oxide production, and testosterone regulation. Manage stress : Pairing Alpha Bites with mindfulness techniques or stress-reducing practices may enhance the product's adaptogenic effects. These habits don't accelerate results, help sustain long-term improvements, and maximize the supplement's return on investment. Warnings and Precautions While Alpha Bites is made from natural, non-GMO ingredients and is manufactured in FDA-registered facilities under GMP guidelines, users should be aware of the following: Do not use if under 18 years old . Consult a healthcare professional before starting if you have known medical conditions, are taking prescription medications, or are being treated for hormonal imbalances or cardiovascular issues. Avoid combining Alpha Bites with other testosterone boosters or nitric oxide supplements without medical guidance. In the next section, we'll evaluate Alpha Bites's performance compared to other leading male enhancement gummies on the market, analyzing differences in ingredients, results, and trustworthiness to demonstrate why Alpha Bites stands out in 2025. IX. Alpha Bites vs Other Male Enhancement Gummies The market for male enhancement products is highly competitive, and with dozens of brands promising everything from enhanced libido to instant performance, it's crucial to distinguish hype from substance. In this section, we compare Alpha Bites with other popular male enhancement gummies and supplements available in 2025, such as Boostaro, Red Boost, Erecta Gummies, and various private-label formulas found on eCommerce marketplaces. By examining ingredients, transparency, safety, pricing, and customer satisfaction , Alpha Bites emerges as a category leader designed with consumer trust and holistic male wellness in mind. 1. Ingredient Transparency and Dosage Integrity Many male enhancement products use proprietary blends\u2014meaning the ingredients are listed, but their exact dosages are hidden. This often results in underdosing, where key compounds like Maca or Tribulus are included in ineffective quantities for marketing purposes only. Alpha Bites: Fully discloses each active ingredient and its dosage . Avoids proprietary blends entirely. Includes clinically supported dosages of Beet Root, Maca, Horny Goat Weed, Tribulus Terrestris, Catuaba Bark, and Vitamin C. Competitors: Often rely on \"proprietary performance blends.\" Include filler ingredients or low concentrations of premium botanicals. May exaggerate benefits without scientific grounding. 2. Natural Formulation vs Synthetic Enhancers Alpha Bites: 100% plant-based , non-GMO, and free from synthetic hormones or chemicals. Designed to work with the body's hormonal and circulatory systems , not override them. Competitors: Some contain synthetic stimulants or harsh aphrodisiacs , increasing the risk of side effects. May rely on temporary vasodilators that lead to \"crashes\" or cardiovascular strain. 3. Performance vs Gimmicks Alpha Bites: Focuses on sustainable performance , not just a one-time boost. Designed for daily use to improve energy, stamina, and hormone balance over time. Competitors: Often marketed as \"fast-acting\" or \"instant results,\" it appeals to impulse buyers but lacks longevity. Formulas may not support long-term vitality, energy, or testosterone levels. 4. Purchasing Model and Guarantee Alpha Bites: Sold direct-to-consumer only from the official website ( getalphabites.com ). No hidden subscriptions or auto-shipments . Backed by a 180-day money-back guarantee \u2014far exceeding industry norms. Competitors: Many products offer 14- or 30-day return windows , with restocking fees. Auto-renew traps are typical\u2014some customers unknowingly subscribe to monthly billing. 5. User Trust and Reputation Alpha Bites: Highly rated for honest advertising , transparent formulation, and real results. Developed in the United States in GMP-certified, FDA-registered facilities . Earns trust through hundreds of verified positive testimonials. Competitors: Many brands have limited background transparency. Negative reviews often highlight billing disputes, side effects, or lack of results . Conclusion of Comparison When measured across core performance metrics, safety, pricing fairness, and long-term user experience, Alpha Bites consistently outperforms much of the competition. Its formula is not only clinically thoughtful but also ethically marketed, making it an ideal solution for men looking for real, sustainable results without compromises.

Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream formulated with salicylic acid to exfoliate your skin (without being too rough), and hyaluronic acid to help it retain moisture. This can help your d\u00e9colletage area to appear smoother and firmer \u2014 in fact, multiple reviewers have noticed a difference in a matter of *pause for dramatic effect* DAYS. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"My dry neck and the annoying itchiness I used to experience have completely gone away after using this cream. It\u2019s not only soothing, but it also feels like it\u2019s really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It\u2019s become a must-have in my skincare routine.\" \u2014 JAcosta Get it from Amazon for $11.89 (also available in a two-pack). 2. A Bissell multipurpose carpet and upholstery cleaner reviewers absolutely love for removing stains and messes from carpets, furniture, and car interiors. Don't let the fact that it's small and portable fool you; this little green cleaning machine has a pow-er-ful suction! So if you've been ignoring those salt and mud stains all over the floor of your car, it's about time you clicked \"add to cart.\" www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I was super skeptical. My dog was not feeling well and started relieving himself on our bedroom rug. I had tried multiple spray cleaners and techniques but couldn\u2019t get the smell out. I was convinced I\u2019d need to get rid of my rug, and this was my last shot. I honestly thought I\u2019d have to return it. Nope!! Easy to assemble. Easy to use and clean. I used it with the pet cleaning solution. My rug is clean and odor free!!! I\u2019m excited to use this on my couch and in my car now. So happy!\" \u2014 Brittany Get it from Amazon for $122+ (available in three styles). 3. A pet ear cleanser for a gentle, non-toxic way to manage your doggo's dirty ears, especially if they have enough wax in there to make a (very gross) candle! Plus, it'll leave their ears smelling fresh because as much as we love our furry babes, they stink... like, all over... all the time. amazon.com Promising review: \"My husband and I just adopted our cute puppy, Winston, from the Humane Society. When we adopted him, his ears were unfortunately pretty dirty, but after we used this ear cleaner today, his ears are so clean!! I'm so amazed at everything it managed to get out. Our puppy's ears look so much better now! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a dog.\" \u2014 Jerome F Get it from Amazon for $16.99 . 4. Topicals Faded serum to help reduce the appearance of dark spots, scars, and uneven skin tone. Thanks to its formula with antioxidants and inflammation-reducing and brightening ingredients (like kojic acid and niacinamide), many reviewers say the results are definitely noticeable with consistent use! One reviewer even calls it a \"miracle worker.\" Sephora Just so you know, reviewers say that Faded's scent is on the stronger side, but it's totally worth it once the results start happening! Topicals is a WOC-founded small business started by Claudia Teng and Olamide Olowe. The brand is all about helping you love the skin you're in, with a little help from their effective, science-backed products. Promising reviews : \" What is this witchcraft?! I've tried every hyped-up treatment on the market over the past five years to address hyperpigmentation, and none of them had the noticeable impact that Topicals Faded did in just three uses so far. This stuff is amazing. I have no idea why this has been so effective, but I'm a customer for life now.\" \u2014 ShannonD726 \" The hype is real!! This is an instant holy grail for me. Yes, there is a smell when you apply the product, but it dissipates almost instantly. In my opinion, it is worth it for the results. I would rather have a product that actually does what it says as opened to one that is filled with irritating fragrances. This product has revered hyperpigmentation that I have had for YEARS. Please never change!!\" \u2014 KierynJoy Get it from Amazon for $18+ (available in two sizes) or from Sephora for $18+ (available in two sizes). 5.

Promising reviews: \"Product was awesome. It rejuvenated a 5-year-old tattoo and made it look like new again. Mad Rabbit absorbed into the skin very easily without being greasy.\" \u2014 Janson Ward \"This stuff is the best! My girlfriend bought this before but I didn\u2019t like the scent she had, but the spreadability of this was to die for. When I found out they had different scents, I was so excited. I want to get more tattoos just so I can put it all over my body. \ud83e\udd23\" \u2014 Iris Kotico Get it from Amazon for $16.30+ (available in two scents). 6. A bottle of sulfate-free biotin shampoo infused with tea tree and argan oils to help stimulate hair growth. Over time, it's meant to make your locks appear fuller while also nourishing your scalp. More than 36,000 reviewers (with all different hair types) have noticed positive results \u2014 so if you've been searching and searching for a solution to hair thinning, give this a try! www.amazon.com Read more about how biotin shampoo could help with the fullness of hair at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"I love this shampoo! I had gastric sleeve surgery and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo as recommended by my doctor. It doesn\u2019t make your hair grow by washing it but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on) and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal. It's longer and thicker than ever. I still use it twice a week and love it! I [don't love] the way it smells but others love it when they smell my hair.\" \u2014 Diane J. Huff Get it from Amazon for $13.95 . 7. A reviewer-loved retinol body lotion , which is also infused with ferulic acid, shea butter, vitamin E, and green tea \u2014 a wondrous combo that can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, crepy skin, and sun damage on your whole body. Because who said retinol was only for your face?? Like the reviewer below, you'll be kicking yourself for not snagging this sooner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I could kick myself for not trying this sooner! It is my new favorite lotion... After one night of using this, I woke up to smooth, soft moisturized skin that wasn\u2019t itchy at all. This lotion goes on and absorbs beautifully. It\u2019s not too thin or thick, and the scent is sensational... It\u2019s not greasy or slick and does not have a residue that pills or transfers.\" \u2014 TickTokAlice Get it from Amazon for $18.99 . 8. A mattifying I Dew Care dry shampoo powder to dab on your roots anytime your hair is looking a bit too greasy for your liking, but you don't have time to wash it. The ultra-fine, hypoallergenic powder works to absorb oil, sweat, and dirt from your hair, making it look more fresh and voluminous. www.amazon.com , Amazon BTW, this is cruelty-free! Get a look at how it's used on TikTok . Promising review: \"I bought this in desperation after having elbow surgery, which left me unable to wash my own hair. I have tried countless dry shampoo sprays and have been disappointed every time. But this? Absolutely 100% game changer. It kept my hair feeling clean and oil free for several days at a time. It's easy to use, absorbs in quickly, no white residue on my dark hair, and you don't need much. I will never buy another brand again. This is my holy grail of dry shampoo .\" \u2014 Bad Girl Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in six shades). 9. A jar of internet-famous The Pink Stuff \u2014 this all-purpose cleaning paste has over 155,000 5-star reviews for a reason! \ud83c\udf1f It can help remove even the toughest dirt, grime, and rust from your appliances, walls, dishes, floors... you name it!

Promising review: \"I saw someone using this on TikTok and I was skeptical at first, but for $7 I thought I'd try it anyway. I am SO glad I bought this! I had a hair dye stain on the bottom of my bathtub for about a year from dyeing my hair at home, and I tried EVERYTHING...nail polish remover, Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, Scrubbing Bubbles foam spray, etc., with no avail. I also had calcium stains on the drain of my bathtub and sink that were a pain to get out. This product erased all of these stains with ease and made it look like they were never there! This is your sign to buy this...I am so happy!\" \u2014 Savannah M. Get it from Amazon for $5.97 . 10.

It's formulated with jojoba, grape seed, rose, and other oils to help gradually decrease pesky bumps and scars over time. www.amazon.com This product does not promise to work overnight. Apply this daily 2\u20133 times a day as long as needed. Be sure to be patient as the healing process takes time! Talk to your doctor before attempting to treat your keloid on your own, and learn more about keloids from Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"This product is amazing!! Truly a miracle product. I had an AWFUL keloid bump forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done, and it was just getting bigger and more irritated by the day; nothing was helping. I bought this stuff and started using it, and in less than two weeks, my huge keloid was completely gone! I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn\u2019t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then the second week, it started totally disappearing, so make sure to give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick! Also smells pretty good, definitely no bothersome or overwhelming scent which is appreciated in a product that I\u2019m applying on the nose area.\" \u2014 Jordan C. Get it from Amazon for $12.85 (also available in multipacks). 11. Onyx Professional Hard as Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream infused with vitamins, minerals, and emollients to assist fragile nails and help them avoid splitting, chipping, peeling, and cracking. If years of acrylics have done some damage to your nails (same) and you're looking to restore them to their pre-monthly-expensive-fill-ins state, this is here to help. amazon.com Plus, it smells like coconuts! Promising review: \"My natural nails are horrible! They are thin and brittle, and have a tendency to split, peel and break. Consequently, I wore acrylic nails for several years until I got tired of leaving so much money at the nail salon. When I soaked off the acrylics, my nails were, of course, worse than ever, and nothing I tried seemed to restore them to even their original condition until I found Hard as Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream. I rub this into my cuticles and nail beds several times a day, and after two months, my nails are hard and much thicker with no breaking or splitting. For the first time since I took off the acrylics, my nails are growing past my fingertips. This cream is a keeper, I just ordered my second jar, and I'll never again be without it.\" \u2014 M. Hill Get it from Amazon for $7.94 . 12. A foot file so you can scrape off the dead skin and calluses to make your feet soft and smooth again. No more snagging your socks with your dry heels. amazon.com Promising review: \"OMG, these should be standard issue for every human. I\u2019ve bought them all: the cheap foot files, the expensive ones, the Ped Egg, and even a foot file from that direct sales nail wrap company. None of those remotely compare to this one. I thought I was reduced to course heels forever; no more! With just one use, my heels are fabulous! The calluses this thing removed were absolutely disgusting, but I couldn\u2019t be happier. You won\u2019t be disappointed!!\" \u2014 JMart Get it from Amazon for $8.88 . 13. A pack of multipurpose dermaplaning razors for gently removing peach fuzz and dirt from your face and making it feel as smooth as a baby's bottom. Plus, you can use it to shape your eyebrows, too! Which means less money being spent on getting them waxed or threaded every other week. amazon.com Promising review: \"I used to pay a professional to dermaplane my face once a month to remove the peach fuzz, which makes me look older and makes the makeup application more cumbersome. I searched for years for a home product to use to save money and time. This is the closest I have been able to get to professional dermaplaning in the convenience of my home, on my time/schedule, and at a fraction of the price. Love it!\" \u2014 SEM1969 Get a three-count from Amazon for $5.94 (also available in a pack of nine). 14.

Promising review: \"Every winter, my fingers and knuckles crack and bleed. I've tried everything on the market to heal my hands. I received this hand cream yesterday, and when I put it on, I could tell right away that it was better than anything I'd tried. This stuff started working immediately. I filled all the cuts and cracks on my hands with this cream, and today, they are almost healed. I believe that this is the best hand cream ever made on earth.\" \u2014 Steve Get it from Amazon for $9.62 (also available in multipacks). 15.

It is the best, most high-quality, and most popular product you can find at a drugstore. I know people from all walks of life who use it \u2014 it\u2019s a universal favorite. It blends beautifully, has so many color options, and the applicator design is perfect for both use and portability. It\u2019s my go-to every time. I appreciate this product so much \u2014 100 out of 10! \" \u2014 AS Get it from Amazon for $8.80 (available in 24 shades, including color-correctors). 16.

Promising review: \"I don\u2019t usually do reviews on products, but for this one, I absolutely have to. I have 3c type hair and struggle with a lot a breakage, unmanageability, and moisture. When my mom mentioned this product to me, I didn\u2019t take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would have thought this brand would work on my hair ... I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair. This product is so amazing, and I will FOREVER be using this product in my hair regimen.\" \u2014 Theressa Hailey Get it from Amazon for $8.20 . 17. A powerful RMR-86 spray to help get rid of stubborn mold and mildew stains in your bathroom, on your patio, and more. And you don't even have to scrub! Just spray the area and watch the stains (and musty odors) vanish. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this RMR spray with low expectations, even with the good reviews. I sprayed a small patch in the evening and let it sit overnight. The next morning, the grout where I had sprayed was as white as if it were brand new. I decided to spray the entire wall and part of the roof. The next day, everything I sprayed had no visible mold. By the third night, I was pretty much spraying everything left in the shower. This stuff is amazing.\" \u2014 John Werner Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in three sizes and a two-pack). 18. Or a Skylarlife mold and mildew stain remover gel great for those tiny crevices, like silicone and rubber caulking \u2014 because those tubs and showers can get gross within the blink of an eye.

I just received this yesterday, applied it last night and this morning it\u2019s like I have a brand new bathroom. I\u2019m embarrassed to show 'before' and 'after' photos cuz it was so nasty, no matter how hard we scrubbed the mildew wouldn\u2019t go away. I almost cried when I saw my bathroom this mornings. Don\u2019t hesitate, buy this now, you won\u2019t regret it.\" \u2014 Bianca Green Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 19. A descaling solution for an effective way to finally remove the mineral buildup and limescale from your coffee machine or espresso maker. It'll help extend the life of your machine and improve the taste of your coffee. Besides, your most-used kitchen appliance deserves some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. amazon.com Promising review: \"I had never even thought of descaling my 2-year-old Keurig before Amazon suggested it, but this stuff was cheap, I knew I was supposed to descale regularly, and I knew this kind of descaler wouldn't be as hard to rinse out as the smell of vinegar. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the next morning, it took much less time for the water to heat up, and my coffee tasted twice as strong and rich as it did before descaling, which means the brewing temperature is higher now that the heating element isn't caked with mineral deposits. Now I feel a little silly for drinking mediocre coffee for so long.\" \u2014 Lenore Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a two-pack). 20. A bottle of Bread Beauty hair gel , a water-based styler that works for all hair types but is particularly formulated for those with coils and curls to lock in their natural pattern.

Promising review: \"I am not a gel person, but the reviews convinced me...I really thought my hair was going to be this messy, crunchy clump of hair, but it was the complete opposite! In love with the defining gel! Soft, defined, and shiny while keeping my volume! 1000% recommend!\" \u2014 Bakerspassion Get it from Amazon , from Sephora , or Bread Beauty Supply for $26. 21.

Promising review: \"I seriously can't believe how well these little tablets work. I had the most disgusting HydroFlask coffee mug \u2014 I tried everything. A bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING, and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY without even scrubbing. They look brand new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. I liked it so much that I used it on another HydroFlask I use primarily to hold my Bloody Mary mix in the fridge. I couldn't put anything else in it because it would always taste like spicy tomato juice. Bottle Bright to the rescue! No residual smell or taste anymore. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get a 12-pack from Amazon for $8 . 22.

Promising review: \"Naturally, because of the ingredients, it has a strong smell. However, it does seem to leave my dog's skin feeling dry and provides good relief for her poor itchy skin. My dog Molly is a 9-pound mini dachshund whose little chest makes contact with the grass all the time, so her skin gets itchy and irritated. I\u2019ve been bathing her regularly with this shampoo, and it is giving her some relief. No more greasy, flaky skin. Her skin and fur is now dry and soft. \" \u2014 Climbyourarms Get it from Amazon for $9.87 (also available in a larger size). 23. A pack of cleaning erasers to make your kid's coffee table art project ~magically~ disappear. Just wet the sponge with water and wipe the surface down \u2014 that's it!

I was one step away from going to the dermatologist. I had severe dandruff that was so bad, I could shake my head and it would come off. With just a few uses per week, I got rid of all my flakes. My scalp also stopped burning from dryness. My hair has never been healthier. \" \u2014 Moo Moo Get it from Amazon for $15.88 . 25. Essence Lash Princess Mascara \u2014 almost 300,000 reviewers swear by this cruelty- and paraben-free, budget-friendly mascara (and I'm one of them)! It's less than $5 (the price of a latte), it's lengthening, volumizing, and way easier to apply than fake lashes. What else could ya ask for? Kayla Boyd / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Plus, a lot of reviewers say it's even better than the popular Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara! I have this mascara, and it is my FAVORITE (that's my face on the left)! I am constantly buying more when I run out. Plus, it's so dang affordable. Check out my in-depth Lash Princess mascara review . Promising review: \" Better than popular name brands at a fraction of the cost!! As a woman who has bought every mascara out there, from expensive department store exclusives (around $30+ ) to brands found in local drugstores...this mascara rivals and is somewhat BETTER than all I've bought before. It gives your lashes a thick, full length in a few coats. UNBELIEVABLE for the price!! I highly recommend it. You will see for yourself!! I am shocked at how great my lashes look in only two coats!! \" \u2014 Lisa Baker Get it from Amazon for $4.99 . 26. A pack of convenient blotting sheets made to help eliminate that T-zone oiliness on the go. They can be used with or without makeup on and will give your face a nice refresh if you're tired of having a constant oily shine as soon as you leave the house. amazon.com Promising review: \"I LOVE these oil-absorbing sheets! I tried them out a few years ago but didn't get around to writing a review until now. I've tried other blotting sheets, and they've either broken me out or just did not absorb all the oil. Every time I come back to these, I realize they are truly the best. I have SUPER-oily skin (and cystic acne, which I have the scars to show for), and this makes me feel sooo fresh and even calms down active pimples/acne. As you can see, it truly removes all of the oil and keeps it that way for several hours. Very cute design, too, and really easy to use and keep anywhere with you. Amazing price for what it does. If you're hesitating to buy it, just go for it!\" \u2014 Noopur D. Get a pack of 100 sheets from Amazon for $6.95 (available in three formulas and various pack sizes). 27. A pack of cleaning tablets to get rid of all the grime from inside your dishwasher and stop it from having any weird smells and hidden residue. Having a clean machine will help ensure your dishes are actually getting clean, too! amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and just not getting clean. Then, I saw a product test review for Affresh in Good Housekeeping magazine. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway, so I added that to my order. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I am amazed!\" \u2014 Sheila Get a six-pack from Amazon for $8.95 . 28. A Briogeo leave-in conditioning spray formulated with coconut oil and argan oil to help all hair textures minimize frizz for up to 48 hours. Just spritz your hair with this for added shine, smoothness, and a very pleasant scent. Some reviewers say it makes brushing out tangles easier too! Sephora Review with all hair types, from curly to very straight , love it! Briogeo is a Black woman-founded business. Promising review: \"Smooth and hydrated hair. \ud83d\udc93 Instantly, yes. I have struggled to find a leave-in that doesn't make my hair feel greasy afterward, actually hydrates my hair, and uses effective ingredients. It smells amazing. I do appreciate that it is reasonably priced as well. Well done. \ud83d\udc4f\" \u2014 Chrispydao Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes) or from Sephora for $25 . 29. A set of bestselling drawer dividers to keep your socks paired, your undies sorted, and prevent your bras from getting crushed and damaged. amazon.com The set includes four bins: a six-cell (good for scarves, tight, or leggings), an eight-cell (good for underwear, briefs, and ties), a seven-cell (ideal for bras), and a 24-cell (for socks). Promising review: \"No matter how neatly I fold my bras and underwear, they always seem to become a big jumble in the drawer. These organizers are perfect for keeping everything in place, and you won't forget about those items you own that end up buried at the back.\" \u2014 M. Hanson Get a set of four from Amazon for $13.87 (available in seven colors). 30. A pack of thin velvet hangers so you can fit more into your closet and not worry about all of your shirts sliding off right after you've just finished putting your laundry away (finally \u2014 I mean, it's been sitting on that chair for weeks). amazon.com Promising review: \"The difference in my closet because of the hangers alone is striking. I can finally shift clothes to the side to actually see what I have. While some may think that saving their money and dealing with a tight closet is worth it, I am completely sold on making the change. So happy I pulled the trigger. I've purchased 100 more just now so that I can do the same for my boyfriend's closet.\" \u2014 ChristineSD Get a 30-pack from Amazon for $16.29 (also available in 50- and 100-packs and in nine colors). 31. A stainless-steel tongue cleaner to scrape the grossness from your tongue that you probably didn't even realize was there (which can also help get rid of stinky breath). Prepare to be simultaneously disgusted and satisfied because yes, your tongue really is pink underneath all that brownish-yellow gunk! amazon.com Promising review: \"Unfortunately, I, like many, suffer from bad breath and have tried so many things to stop it. I read that sometimes it's the germs on your tongue that can cause it, so I went crazy trying to brush my tongue. Of course, we all know how that ends \u2014 gagging, watery eyes, and it still looks like that gross film is on your tongue. I finally decided that maybe it was time to get a tongue cleaner, and it had to be a stainless steel one because they are easier to clean and sterilize. This product is really easy to use, and I can get very far back on my tongue without activating my gag reflex. Also, it doesn't have the feeling that brushing with a toothbrush does. This cleaner just glides across my tongue, taking all the icky germs and bad breath with it. I love my nice new fresh breath and bolster of confidence!\" \u2014 jordanb Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in packs of two or 12). 32. A jetted tub cleaner so you can get the junk out of your tub and actually be able to have a nice, relaxing bubble bath. There might be plenty of dirt and dead skin cells hiding in those jets, and it has no business sticking around. Simply run your water, pour in some cleaner, and start your jets. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a walk-in tub 18 months ago. I was just looking for something to clean it with. I found this product and watched the video reviews. This product is just as advertised! Even better! When you use your air and water jets, you are recycling the tub water you are sitting in. Soap scum, skin cells, and mold buildup in the pipes. This stuff cleans it all out on the first application. 4 oz is all it takes. The first time I used this product, the tub water looked like I had thrown up in my tub. All this gunk was floating in the water. Great product. I will use this every week.\" \u2014 THOMAS O. MCCUTCHEON Get it from Amazon for $18.73 . 33. A carpet cleaner to once and for all make that huge spaghetti stain in the middle of your living room carpet ~disappear~. Just spritz some on the stain, wait a few seconds, and blot it up. It's like magic! amazon.com Promising review: \"It\u2019s a miracle in a bottle. My German shepherd mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping \u2014 this cleaner lifted the stain, and now it\u2019s like the devastation my dog caused never happened! As soon as I saw it lifting the ink, I got back on Amazon and bought more bottles. I will never let myself run out of this. I use it in my Bissell carpet cleaner for some crazy good cleaning power. I\u2019ve become that weird lady who goes around singing the praises of a cleaning product. No regrets.\" \u2014 L. Logan Get it from Amazon for $6.88 (also available in multipacks). 34. A shower door cleaner so you can finally get rid of the soap scum and hard water stains and make it so that the place where you clean yourself is, well, clean. It's super quick, easy, and effective and you wanna know the best part? It also leaves behind a coating that helps protect the glass from collecting more grossness over the next few weeks! Less cleaning is ALWAYS a win. amazon.com Promising review: \"This product works beautifully. I tried a lot of products to remove the hard water from my glass shower. I have to admit the first time I used it with a cloth, it was not very effective. The second time I used a nonabrasive sponge for glass, it turned out beautiful just like the first day the glass was installed.\" \u2014 EJP Get it from Amazon for $11.65 . 35. Plus! A grout paint marker to turn that icky brown color between your bathroom (or kitchen) tiles into a bright, clean white. Your floors will look brand-new again \u2014 without a bunch of tedious scrubbing (because who has time for that??). amazon.com This won't clean your grout, but it'll make it look brand-new. Promising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom, plus a little of the shower, with one pen. It is pretty forgiving,g and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely. This was not a quick task, but it went faster than I thought it would. I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!\" \u2014 Jenelle Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in wide tip). 36. Heavy-duty cleaning wipes that'll help you quickly and easily clean up grease, oil, dirt, ink, makeup, food, and more on pretty much any surface. No need to take a chunk of time out of what you're doing to hunt down the mop, broom, cleaning sprays, etc. amazon.com Promising review: \"I think these wipes are made out of magic because they can clean just about anything with very little effort! One wipe cleaned my ENTIRE BATHTUB, including the hard water buildup and some residual soap scum. The wipe stayed wet for the entire use, and there was absolutely no sweating involved. I hate cleaning, but I was so pumped about the tub, I took wipe #2 to my hood vent, and good golly, it's like it's brand-new. I've told everyone I know to buy these.\" \u2014 JenM Get a 90-pack from Amazon for $14.98 . 37. A Clorox ToiletWand cleaning kit , which includes a wand, caddy, and six disposable refills, so you can eliminate the germs and stains in your toilet without having to reach down in there or touch anything gross. The scrub pads are preloaded with cleaner, so it's both convenient and effective. amazon.com Promising review: \"So, we have a toilet that belongs to the cats. We don't use it, we don't look at it, we like to pretend it does not exist. Even with semi-regular flushing, cat waste is pretty nasty stuff and builds up quickly in the bowl. One of these wands cleaned it up in a single session! Before-and-after pic attached (above).\" \u2014 Whitney Get it from Amazon for $11.98 . 38. A gas range cleaning spray that'll cut through grease with just a simple spray and wipe. Now you don't have to dread when your partner cooks, knowing that they never clean up the grease splatters. This will make it extra easy! amazon.com Here's why BuzzFeed Shopping editor Daniel Boan loves this stuff: \"This stuff is THE TRUTH. My roommate is the best, but let's just say wiping down the stove after cooking is not one of her favorite activities. I'm not particularly fond of doing the dishes, so I guess we're even. Anyway, I spray this on a few times a week, let it sit for about five minutes, then wipe it with a cloth, and it removes EVERYTHING. Like, every little spot of caked-on grease and burnt crumbs come off with just one wipe.\" Get a two-pack from Amazon for $17.98 . 39. A jewelry cleaning stick to restore your bling and have it looking like it did when it was first purchased. This convenient stick is preloaded with a formula that helps to remove dirt and oils, reduces fine scratches, repels grime, and provides shine! If your engagement ring has seen better days, but you don't want to spend the money on professional cleaning, this will help it get its sparkle back. amazon.com Promising review: \"This little pen brush is incredible! I wasn't sure if it would work well on my emerald engagement ring since it's mostly advertised for diamonds, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have been wearing the ring since getting engaged in October, and even though I had it cleaned at the jeweler's in April, it just didn't seem as bright as it was when it was new, and I thought it would just always be a little cloudy. But after cleaning it once with the Dazzle Stik, I was blown away by the difference \u2014 it looks as bright and sparkly as when I first got it! I'm so glad I didn't buy an ultrasonic cleaner, since this is so much less expensive and easier and gentler. It took me less than a minute to clean, and I can do it whenever I want! And it's honestly better than when the jeweler cleaned it. So thrilled!\" \u2014 KFray Get it from Amazon for $9.48 . 40. A bestselling and surprisingly inexpensive Arvazallia argan oil hair mask that'll strengthen and restore weak and damaged hair. It'll make your locks look shiner and feel healthier (and who doesn't want shiny, healthy hair??). Sure, there are a lot of hair masks out there, but more than 300 reviewers claim this is one of the BEST. amazon.com Reviewers with 4C hair , curly hair , and straight, dyed hair rave about this! Promising review: \"My hair is very thin and curly. The ends are damaged from heat and color, causing my hair to look even more unruly. I do oil treatments once a week and only wash my hair two to three times a week, but NOTHING has made my hair feel like this product does. There is an immediate difference as soon as this product touches my hair. It leaves my hair feeling so silky, even after I rinse it out and dry my hair.\" \u2014 Melissa Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 41. A rubber broom basically guaranteed to make all of your floors look brand-spanking new. The 100% natural rubber brush picks up hair (both pet and human) like a magnet and easily gathers it from carpets, rugs , hardwood, and linoleum. Plus, it has a built-in squeegee on the other side to assist you with liquid spills! Emma Lord/BuzzFeed Promising review: \"I have two dogs \u2014 a terrier mix and a short-hair dachshund mix. I have a navy woven couch that LOVES my dachshund's fur. I have tried pretty much everything to get the fur out \u2014 traditional lint roller, those blue fuzzy lint rollers, special vacuum attachments, etc. The terrier's fur comes out great with all of those options. The dachshund's fur, much like the dachshund herself, remains stubbornly on my couch. I got this product as the new 'let's see if it works' item of the month with low expectations. THE FUR ACTUALLY CAME OUT GUYS. It acts like a broom for my couch \u2014 sweeping the fur (with some elbow grease) basically onto the floor where I vacuum it up! Give this a try if my story sounds pretty similar to yours!\" \u2014 Janielle Get it from Amazon for $19.76 . 42. A wrinkle releaser and fabric freshening spray for mornings when you really don't have time to iron, but you also really need to wear THAT specific shirt for your work presentation. amazon.com Promising review: \"This is literally like an iron in a bottle. It's fantastic. This morning, my shirt had a crease from being folded, but I didn't have time to change, so I misted just one spray on the shirt, shook it out while I was wearing it, and the crease was gone. I cannot express how much I love this! I spray it over my shirts and shake them out a couple of times, then hang them u,p and they are completely wrinkle-free, and it smells like everything just came right out of the laundry, which is also a plus.\" \u2014 Kayla Get a two-pack, plus a travel-size from Amazon for $16.99 (available in five scents and various packs and sizes). 43. An all-purpose scrubber kit \u2014 it comes with three different brushes you can attach to your drill and use to remove any of that hard-to-clean grossness that's caked up on your stove, grill, shower, or floor. What would have taken you hours to scrub can now be accomplished in minutes! You're welcome. amazon.com And if you don't have a drill, here's one on Amazon for $39.59 \u2014 it has over 16,000 5-star ratings! Promising review: \"I bought this on a whim because my walk-in shower is just a pain to clean. I'm 51, and I guess I've just been old school with how I clean, hand scrubbing for years. T he FIRST time I used this to clean my shower, it took five minutes, AND it scrubbed my shower more clean than it has been in years. In the corners, the floor, the glass door...everything came out squeaky clean. I'm NEVER cleaning my shower by hand again.\" \u2014 Terry Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in six bristle stiffnesses).

Emporium Make it easier on yourself, by getting these cheaper versions of pricey Disney souvenirs that we found. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. One thing you\u2019re guaranteed to see at Disney World, are little ones launching bubbles everywhere out of their bubble wands. Join the fun with a cheaper option, with this Disney Mickey Bubble Wand ! \u00a9Amazon Bubble wands are extremely popular at the Parks, they\u2019re one of the most sold items. This bubble wand isn\u2019t much different. The Mickey head shaped wand features sound and lighting effects \u2014 it will blink blue, green, and red. The wand also comes with solution. We think this is a great alternative for kids! You can order these before your trip and already have them ready to go for the parks! View on Amazon This Mickey and Friends Autograph Book is a great deal for those who love to get signatures from their favorite Disney characters! Don\u2019t worry about getting a more expensive autograph book, when you can get one like this. \u00a9Amazon It comes with a Mickey pen and some alphabet stickers, so you can personalize you\u2019re book. We love the cover featuring Mickey and his pals (and sweetheart). The fireworks and castle give it a nice pop as well. Best of all, the item is 46% off at the moment! This one is under $10. The ones in the parks will run you over $20. View on Amazon You\u2019ve probably seen a lot of Disney goers rocking this portable charger. The FuelRod Portable Charger Kit is a must-have! The kit comes with two chargers, and includes all cables and adapters needed for you phone. We LOVE using portable chargers! The kit does come with a rechargeable backup power bank as well. The cool thing about these is you can swap dead one\u2019s for new recharged ones. Just find a kiosk located at different spots around Disney World, and swap out. These are about half the price if you buy them before your trip! View on Amazon Here\u2019s a little shopping hack for you Disney lovers. If you look at the Disney Store online, you can sometimes find Disney ears for a little bit of a discount. We especially love these Minnie Mouse Polka Dot Ears ! \u00a9DisneyStore The reason they can be cheaper online than in person, is because they are often a part of sales. Whereas they almost never go on sale at a Disney Park! These ones are currently $10 off. View Online Like we mentioned with the ears, the same can be said for Spirit Jersey esc tops. It\u2019s always smart to look online first before shopping at the park, because you never know if the one you like could be on sale. Take a look at this Disney World Logo Pullover Sweater ! \u00a9DisneyStore Although it isn\u2019t a typical Disney iconic Spirit Jersey, this is pretty close to. This sweater has the Disney World logo at the front, and has the classic full name print on the back. It\u2019s available at an amazing price right now! View Online The same thing can also be said about designer items \u2014 crazy online shopping hack right! Designer items are very rarely ever marked down at the Parks, but online that\u2019s a different story. We love the style of this Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck Backpack ! \u00a9DisneyStore This bag is designed by Lily Pulitzer ! We love the Hawaiin type theme to the backpack. The colors really pop and mesh well together, and the subtle add of Minnie and Daisy is a chefs kiss. You won\u2019t believe the price it\u2019s going for right now! You\u2019re going to want this for your next Disney trip. View Online You\u2019ve probably caught onto the trend. If you buy Disney souvenirs online, you have a good chance of running into a sale. Whereas in the parks, you most likely won\u2019t find a sale. This applies even to ornaments, like this Cinderella Sketchbook Ornament ! \u00a9DisneyStore We love this ornament capturing the moment Cinderella leaves the ball. She\u2019s got her glass slipper in hand, and the clock has struck midnight. Even Jaq and Gus are featured on the ornament. It\u2019s available online for UNDER $10!

A female jogger is firing back after being criticized for carrying a gun while working out in public. Mikaela Dieppa made her open carry admission in a TikTok clip posted earlier this week, which has clocked up more than 4.2 million views. The mother-of-one, who lives in South Carolina, initially showed off her gun holster as she detailed what she wears while jogging. \u201c[This is my] run outfit of the day. I\u2019m open carrying,\u201d Dieppa declared, flaunting her fashionable fit ahead of her workout. \u201cMy holster is from Amazon, my sports bra and shorts are from Lululemon\u2026 and my favorite running shoes, I\u2019m wearing my Hokas.\u201d 3 Mikaela Dieppa rocks a gun holster as part of her fashionable workout fit. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Explore More Travelers reveal their most bizarre culture shocks when visiting other countries: 'Never get used to it' Hotel guest who paid extra to see the ocean appalled by 'inner city' view \u2014 staff told her to 'lean over the balcony' Tourist couple caught having sex in the middle of the street @mikaeladieppa Protect yourself ladies \ud83d\udc9b #opencarry #womanrunner #gunsafety #runningtips \u266c original sound \u2013 Mikaela Dieppa She defended her decision to be openly armed while exercising, saying: \u201cFor all the people who say I should be concealed carrying when I am on my run, you\u2019re probably not a female who has men slow down and stop to watch them running.\u201d Dieppa claimed that leering men quickly leave her alone when they realize she\u2019s carrying a gun. \u201cProtect yourself ladies,\u201d the locked and loaded brunette captioned the clip. Dieppa told The Post on Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared or paranoid, it\u2019s a fact that women get assaulted in broad daylight all the time, even when taking precautions.\u201d As for the gun, the runner says: \u201cI\u2019d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.\u201d The mom revealed that other women have asked whether they should take similar safety measures, and Dieppa advises: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need it [the gun], but chances aren\u2019t zero.\u201d 3 The gun-toting mama defended her decision to open carry after being criticized by TikTok trolls. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Dieppa\u2019s exercise accessory divided viewers, with some cheering her decision to flaunt the firearm. \u201cEverybody should open carry \u2026.I think everybody should have a gun on them in public,\u201d one defender declared. \u201cCrime would go away.\u201d \u201cOpen carry every time,\u201d another proponent proclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t start nothing, there won\u2019t be nothing.\u201d However, others said Dieppa\u2019s desire to arm herself while exercising was a sad indictment of the American way of life. 3 Dieppa encouraged other women to protect themselves while working out in public.

A cordless grass trimmer that'll help you tackle hard-to-reach areas in your garden bed or simply get the job done if you are the proud owner of a tiny patch of grass. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This tool is awesome and it lasts a long time for trimming around your plants. I love it and recommend for any one who needs to trim around their plants and/or vegetable tree. Mine is a banana tree and was not kept trimmed around it but after getting this tool I'm able to trim around without damaging or making a mess around it.\" \u2014 IC Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in three colors). 2. A variety of sunflower seeds to transform that boring patch of dirt in your yard into a photo shoot\u2013worthy garden without the stress of hand selecting which flowers to plant. Alexa, play \"Sunflower\" by Harry Styles. www.amazon.com Created by Nature is a small business! Promising review: \"Planted a handful of the seeds in our front lawn area. Few months later, and we had a spectacular color array. Great flowers!\" \u2014 Shane Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 3. A standing weeder (without the chemicals!) in case you've found your dream home, but, unfortunately, it came with a grass full of dandelions. Unwind after a busy day at the office with some therapeutic weeding that won't hurt your back. \ud83d\udc4d www.amazon.com Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. Grampa's Weeder is a small business! Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy, has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard, and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun, but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 4. A programmable timer to work some Fairy Godmother-like magic on your hose and transform it into a sprinkler. Bibbidi, Bobbidi, Boo-tiful lawn! Amazon Reviewers mention it's worth using this product with a water hammer arrester . Promising review: \"These timers have been around for a long time. My dad used them for his garden for years without any issue. The batteries last a long time in these things as well. I\u2019m able to program what days of the weeks to water, how frequently (every 12 hours for twice a day), and how long to water each time. Then just leave the faucet on and you\u2019re good to go. If you want to do another watering on hot days or use the hose for another purpose just click the manual button to trigger a manual watering no need to disconnect.\" \u2014 Taylor Get it from Amazon for $35.81 . 5. A row of colorful flower pots with draining holes and hooks that'll brighten up your deck with very minimal effort. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are adorable. I love the colors. They're lightweight and won't hold more than one or two flowers, but they're perfect for the project I did.\" \u2014 JDub Get 10 from Amazon for $18.59 (available in three styles). 6. A fast-acting lawn repair formula made up of grass seeds, mulch, and soil amendment will undo all the damage your beloved doggo (who, obviously, can't help but pee all over your grass) has done to the yard. Now, back to trying to teach Fido *not* to dig up the new grass... www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I used this in the spring to fill out our lawn more, and it worked great! I was worried because I feel like you always hear grass seed horror stories, but I just raked our lawn good, spread seeds all over, and watered it once (sometimes twice) per day and it filled the lawn in beautifully! \" \u2014 Mariah Get it from Amazon for $16.44+ (available in five sizes). 7. A hedge trimmer that'll ensure your neighbors will be peeking over your fence to get a glimpse at how fabulous those bushes look. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have hesitated for years to buy a hedge trimmer but took the plunge on this one. I am pleasantly surprised; lightweight, easy to handle, cuts my shrubs back easily, and trims my 10-foot tall Cyprus cedar with ease!! I'm 76, wish I had bought one years ago!!\" \u2014 George Goddling Get it from Amazon for $39 . 8. Pruning shears , for anyone who has successfully created their own magical rose garden in their yard. Better get yourself a glass jar too to display it like in Beauty and the Beast . Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I purchased these as a gift for my mother who gardens extensively. She thanked me again for them today, declaring that these were the best pruners she has ever owned (she has been at it over 50 years). She cuts the branches off her trees and shrubs, then further trims them into small sections to fit in the recycle trash bags. It is her great joy to work in the yard made even my pleasant through the use of these pruners.\" \u2014 A. Kelly Get it from Amazon for $18.95. 9. And a long-handled lopper to help you can trim any overgrown bushes or trees in your yard, a must-have for anyone who isn't Edward Scissorhands. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Light, easy to use for pruning my trees, but sturdy. Pruning is effortless. So well-engineered. I can't recommend these enough. And they're affordable. My favorite garden tool now. I don't like heavy tools that I can't maneuver or hurt my hands. This is perfect.\" \u2014 Patsy Get them from Amazon for $28.05+ (available in five styles). 10. A galvanized steel planter bed to bring a bit of organization to your yearly garden of veggies and herbs \u2014 this will keep 'em all housed in one easy-to-tend-to spot instead of plopping them directly into the ground. www.amazon.com I have similar garden beds in my yard! I like how it showcases the vegetable garden itself instead of just digging out a spot in our lawn. We had success with our veggies last year, so my husband and I invested in a third planter for this year. Promising review : \"This raised bed is very affordable. The bed looks thin and flimsy at first, but once it is set up, it is very sturdy even though it is very light to carry around empty. I also appreciate that this is a foot tall and not too shallow like some other raised beds being sold . This is an excellent product and I would recommend it highly for what you are paying for.\" \u2014 JT Get it from Amazon for $49.99 . 11. A Scotts seed spreader you'll adore because 1. it comes fully assembled (thankfully) and 2. it'll ensure your grass seed and fertilizer are spread nice and evenly without an extra effort required. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This model is definitely a cut above the other spreaders made by Scott. It is quite well constructed and has lots of nice features like a large hopper, four drop holes, and dual spreader mechanisms. The wheels on this are very nice as well and the edge guard feature works well. Very easy and effective to use and should provide years of use if maintained properly. Beats the pants off of every other spreader I have used. And it's attractive to boot!\" \u2014 Gila Monster Get it from Amazon for $44.97+ (available in four styles). 12. And a seeding square kit , so planting your lil' sprouts won't turn into a game of guess and check. You'll know *exactly* what pattern you planted your basil seeds in this year. www.amazon.com It also comes with a measuring stick called a dibbler that pushes down the dirt to the correct depth for you to drop your seeds. The holes are color coded to let you know exactly where to plant seeds of different varieties. Promising review: \"Love this thing! I have been gardening for a while and this takes all of the guess work out of spacing . I used this for the first time this spring using the planting chart/guide and it has worked out perfectly. I have had little to no weeds (I mean come on, you're gonna get some weeds). Planting per the Seed Square will for the most part choke out the weeds, while promoting growth for the plants. I even used this to plant growing plants and not just seeds. Just put the square on the ground used the stick to mark the spot and dug a hole where it was marked. Simple enough. Would highly recommend. Super easy!\" \u2014 Jennifer Geisel Get it from Amazon for $29.95 . 13. And vegetable, fruit, and herb markers to help you *actually* keep track of what you planted where \u2014 each stick is individually sold and with over 40 options to choose from you should have no problem finding exactly what you need to keep your garden in check.

My Little Belleville / Etsy My Little Belleville is a small business based in Salt Lake City, Utah that sells kitchenware, stationery, and other home goods. Promising review: \"Such a fun way to add more of a thrill into our gardening skills. One set was for my daughter and one for a friend who shares the green thumb phenomena. Adorable designs.\" \u2014 Barbara Get them from My Little Belleville on Etsy for $17.25 (available in seven styles). 16. Or garden gloves with claws that'll make you feel like the Lady Gaga of gardening and make digging in the dirt both easier and more fashionable. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"If you're like me, I typically ditch the gloves when I'm weeding because I can't get a good hold on the smaller weeds. Not with these gloves! They help me dig up those small weeds quickly. I thought I'd have a hard time picking things up because of the claws, but no. They make weeding so much quicker, and save my nails and hands in the process.\" \u2014 MomOfR&D Get them from Amazon for $6.37 (available in four colors). 17. A scent-free mosquito repellent to keep those lil' bloodsucking buggers at bay while you're trying to plant your daisies or pick your cherry tomatoes. Amazon This device uses scent-free repellent mats using naturally occurring repellents found in plants to rid of mosquitoes. Promising review: \"It doesn't smell. It doesn't make noise. It doesn't get hot. It just clears the mosquitos and only mosquitoes! I am the person a mosquito will find from miles away even in my house. The only one they find in a room full of people. I live in a tropical climate and never have a moment's peace in my garden. I've used sprays, foggers, candles, torches, the list goes on. This is the first time I've been able to sit on my patio in peace, even the cat was safe. Already ordered another for a friend and put the refills on subscribe and save.\" \u2014 J&J Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in 13 colors). 18. A soaker hose you can attach to the hose you already own to provide your bushes, plants, and trees with the shower they've always dreamt of (especially during those too-hot summer days). Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a couple of different soaker hoses and this is the best by far. Unlike the rubbery ones that are heavier and more difficult to intertwine and stay where you place them within your plantings, these are easy to curve around, reposition, or remove . They have clamps to securely connect the hose at the hose ends, which helps avoid leaks or breaks. By comparison, the other kind that has the texture of recycled tires, without clamps, leaked at the connection points and disconnected/failed, resulting in the separation of the hose from the hose ends. Any leaking tends to negate the whole function of the soaker hose. In contrast, this style and brand provides a steady, consistent drip along the hose exactly what I want. So far, durability has been good, and the hose will fold up nicely for storage during the winter months.\" \u2014 Gail Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in seven sizes). 19. A soil test kit to relay the moisture in your plant's soil as well as its pH and light levels so you'll know once and for when it needs to be watered. www.amazon.com This device has two needles to ensure accuracy and doesn't require batteries. Just push it 2\u20134 inches into the ground and select what you want to test for. Promising review: \"I have A LOT of plants, with varied water and light exposure requirements. They would probably all be dead from drought or overwatering if not for this little gadget. So simple to use. I recommend it to my fellow plant-lovers in our social media group.\" \u2014 M. Brooks Get it from Amazon for $7.99 . 20. Knee pads you can count on to make the many hours you typically spend gardening on a Saturday morning a bit more comfortable \u2014 a must-have for anyone whose knees simply aren't what they used to be. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are the best knee pads I have ever used. They allow me to stay on my knees for an extended period of time without getting uncomfortable. I have worn them for 9-hour working days without any issues with fit, adjustment, or comfort. They have great cushioning and are very comfortable, but in my opinion what really makes them better than most other knee pads on the market is the fact that they have two adjustable straps with slip buckles instead of one of the straps being Velcro . \u2014 Shannon Huett Get them from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two styles). 21. An expandable garden hose to help you water your grass, the vegetables you planted and prayed will actually grow, and your flower bed without worrying about any kinks getting in the way. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Have used this for about three weeks, watering flowers, grass and washing cars. Have used it almost every day in some way or another. It's very light, easy to maneuver, and doesn't kink. However, I think that's because I followed the directions on the box for how to unwind it for the first time. When I was first unraveling, it kinked in multiple places, so I had to carefully unravel and lay it out fully extended before I even hooked it up to the water source. Has been kink-free ever since.\" \u2014 Sean Cotter Get it from Amazon for $10.06+ (available in seven sizes). 22. An adjustable gardening bench complete with padding for your knees and handles on the sides to assist you in getting up from the crouched position you've likely been in for a *tad* too long while tending to your veggies. It can even be turned into a seat so you can take a true break! www.amazon.com Promising reviews: \"This is great for the garden. It keeps my knees out of the stickers, and the padding is very comfortable, it helps me get up and down \u2014 it is easy to maneuver around the garden and in between the rows. I haven't tried sitting on it, but I'm heavy, and it feels very sturdy under me. Pockets deep enough for tools and seed packets, easy to remove and wash if necessary.\" \u2014 Cpt Dragon \"I bought this for my mother as she had knee surgery, and now she can sit on it while working in her flower and vegetable boxes. Definitely will purchase it again.\" \u2014 Johnnette Murray Get it from Amazon for $23.99 . 23. A plant supporter that'll give your tomato plants and bushes a bit more support so they can grow big and tall \u2014 since they're powder-coated in green they wont' ruin your garden's *~aesthetic~*. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These plant supports each consist of two semi circles that fit together to encircle the plant. I have two snake plants that are getting taller and needed support. These plant stakes are working perfectly . They can easily be inserted into the soil to the desired height, and the green color obscures their appearance. My plants look prettier and stronger now that they are standing tall.\" \u2014 A.Consumer Get a pack of four from Amazon for $14.99+ (also available in an eight-pack). 24. A garden colander to fill up with all of the fruits and veggies you've worked so hard to grow from little seedlings \u2014 wash 'em off outside with the hose to prevent getting dirt all over your kitchen. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I got this for my elderly parents. They always put out a small garden. I thought this would be perfect for them to gather and carry their vegetables in. Another good part is you can rinse them in it, too! My mom said it was too pretty to use for that, but she uses it. It\u2019s convenient!\" \u2014 Samantha Bastin Get it from Amazon for $19.29+ (available in two colors). 25. A pack of seeds that contain, basically, any kind of vegetable you'd want to grow in your garden \u2014 beets, cucumbers, cabbage, butternut squash, and more.

Organo Republic is a small business! Promising review : \"I purchased it for my mother as a gift and I absolutely love the product. Huge variety and very affordable price! The package looks great and each seed bag is individually labeled along with a QR that takes you directly to all the information you need pertaining to that type of vegetables. Love it.\" \u2014 V. G Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (also available in a a variety of 15 and 25 veggie seeds). 26.

All my plants look full and healthy with little to no effort on my part! I am so amazed that for teacher gifts this year, I am giving terrariums and will include a shaker of Joyful Dirt to go with each.

Shuls, Real Clear Wire Skip to content The \u2018learn to code\u2019 fad is done: Why schools should educate for citizenship By James V. Shuls, Real Clear Wire April 12, 2025 Within the past decade or so we have witnessed something remarkable in education \u2013 the rise and fall of a fad we were promised would revolutionize K-12 education. In the 2010s, tech moguls and others began pushing schools to teach students coding skills, often at the expense of other topics. In 2013, Code.org launched with the claim that every student should learn to code. States began promoting computer science as a core subject. By 2016, President Obama put his weight behind the movement with the Computer Science for All initiative. Fast forward to today, and the experts now tell us students may no longer need those once-prized coding skills. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has said the rise of artificial intelligence is making programming skills less relevant. In a leaked memo, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman reportedly stated that AI would likely replace most software engineers. Most recently, entrepreneur and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya echoed these claims: \u201cThe engineer\u2019s role will be supervisory, at best, within 18 months.\u201d What does Palihapitiya suggest students study instead? \u201cPhilosophy, psychology, history, physics, and English writing.\u201d Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The coding fad follows a well-established pattern. A movement is launched with great fanfare, grows rapidly, pushes for widespread reforms, and then fades into irrelevance. Before coding, there was the 21st century \u201cskills\u201d craze, in which schools were told they needed to prepare students for jobs that didn\u2019t yet exist. The recurring theme of many fads in education is their departure from the timeless purposes of education. Rather than cultivating the intellectual and moral virtues necessary for self-government, they focus on workforce readiness. But to sustain a constitutional republic, the public must have both skills. This lesson is clear if we turn to the women of the Founding era. On August 14, 1776 \u2013 barely a month after the Declaration of Independence was signed \u2013 Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John, responding to his complaints about the poor education of young men: \u201cIf you complain of neglect of Education in sons, what shall I say with regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it?\u201d Most women at the time were not given a proper classical education. They did not read the Greek and Roman poets or moral philosophers. They were unfamiliar with Virgil, Ovid, or leading English thinkers like John Milton and John Locke. Instead, they were taught what we might call \u201c18th-century skills\u201d \u2013 needlework, music, drawing, and etiquette. Abigail Adams knew that an education that focused on domestic tasks or job preparation was insufficient for a free and self-governing society. \u201cIf we mean to have Heroes, Statesmen and Philosophers,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe should have learned women.\u201d It was exactly that kind of education, rooted in the classics, that propelled several leading women of the time to prominence. Mercy Otis Warren, tutored in classical literature alongside her brothers, authored poetry and satirical plays that supported the Revolution and stirred the affections of the colonists. A similar story can be told of the enslaved poet Phillis Wheatley, who inspired the young nation through her verse. Influenced by the evangelical minister George Whitefield, Wheatley\u2019s enslavers provided her with a classical education alongside their own children. Upon receiving a poem from Wheatley, George Washington wrote, \u201cThe style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical talents.\u201d Adams, Warren, and Wheatley stood out because they were educated for citizenship . That\u2019s what an education grounded in the classics \u2013 the best that has been written and thought in human history \u2013 can do. It produces people equipped to think deeply, to reason morally, and to lead wisely. Americans intuitively yearn for this type of education. In a recent poll of more than 2,400 people conducted by the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University, participants were asked what would make U.S. education better. The most popular responses \u2013 selected by roughly 85% of respondents \u2013 included requiring schools to teach the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and mandating an approach to civics that focuses on the Constitution. Seventy-eight percent supported requiring students to demonstrate competence in American history to graduate high school. And 67% favored an education focused on the great texts of Western Civilization \u2013 the very texts Adams, Warren, and Wheatley read. It may be time to move on from coding, but the danger is that we\u2019ll simply replace it with yet another skill set that will soon become obsolete. That would be short-sighted. Today\u2019s students must be trained for the job market \u2013 and also prepared for the responsibilities of self-government. Job skills change. Technologies fade. But an education grounded in civic understanding is timeless and can provide long-term stability to our republic. James V. Shuls, Ph.D., is the Head of K-12 Education Reform at the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

It's lacks a reverse switch, which is problematic if you should be working in limited space (as it is designed to do) and can get stuck if the bolt doesn't have enough clearance to be removed. vid1900 HF Quinn has a set of low profile sockets that fit this, although often, they are more money than the genuine Astro ones.

The Tekton is beefier than the Astro Tools, and is double ended with a flex head on one end and a fixed box on the other end. It's 17 inches long, a bit shorter than the Astro Tools. Tekton web site claims it has a proof torque of 450 ft lbs, nearly double the ASME standard for a 22mm flex head. Astro Tools doesn't give any info on proof torque for their wrench. Tekton is $36 but worth it. 4 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 2 Replies stasis Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM 5,909 Posts Joined Apr 2008 Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM stasis Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM 5,909 Posts Quote from vid1900 : HF Quinn has a set of low profile sockets that fit this, although often, they are more money than the genuine Astro ones.

Discover SCENE Jianwei Xun, the supposed Hong Kong philosopher whose book \"Hypnocracy\" claims Elon Musk and President Donald Trump use utopian promises and empty language, never really existed, at least not physically. Instead, the acclaimed author was a \"collaborative\" creation between Andrea Colamedici, an Italian publisher, and two AI tools \u2013 Claude from Anthropic and ChatGPT from OpenAI. \"I wanted to write a book that would help people better understand the new ways power manifests itself,\" Colamedici told Decrypt . But it wasn't until after an investigative report from L'Espresso that Xun's website was updated to acknowledge the experiment, snapshots from Wayback Machine reviewed by Decrypt show. Still, the book received critical acclaim. L\u2019Espresso reports that L\u2019Opinion , a French daily, had detailed how President Emmanuel Macron had \u201cappreciated\u201d Xun\u2019s writings. Earlier in February, a roundtable at the World AI Cannes Festival extensively discussed Xun\u2019s ideas. \u00c9ditions Gallimard, a leading French publisher, has committed to a new translation from the Italian original, after the first edition in French from Philosophie Magazine. A Spanish translation from Editorial Rosamer\u00f3n is slated for release on April 20. Vibe philosophy? Xun was \"an exercise in ontological engineering,\" Colamedici explained in a post-revelation interview with Le Grand Continent . While this experiment with AI looked novel, critics point out the book could be in trouble. The European Union's AI Act , approved in March 2024, considers failure to label AI-generated content a serious violation \u2013 a requirement critics claim Colamedici's experiment disregarded. In previous versions of its bio, Xun was described as a \"Hong Kong-born cultural analyst and philosopher\" who studied at \u201cDublin University.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. According to an anonymous source from the University College of Dublin's philosophy department, no person named \"Jianwei Xun\" exists in their database or those of other Dublin-based universities. \"The fact that the author had inverted the Chinese order 'surname-name' was an immediate red flag,\" Laura Ruggieri, a Hong Kong-based researcher, told Decrypt , explaining how she spotted inconsistencies as early as February. Ruggieri previously taught semiotics\u2014the study of symbols and signs\u2014at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She asked her colleagues about Xun. Nobody knew who that was. \u201cNot a single one of them has ever met Xun or heard his name,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cIf Colamedici had used his real name and admitted that AI had written the book, no one would have bought it.\u201d Responding to those allegations to Decrypt , Colamedici claimed these were deliberate clues \"left for those willing to question and investigate,\u201d claiming the revelation was \"predetermined.\" \u201cWe actually did everything possible to make Xun\u2019s non-existence evident to anyone with even minimally inquisitive eyes,\u201d Colamedici said. Colamedici insists that AI did not write the book. Instead, Claude and ChatGPT \"served as interlocutors.\" In the words of Xun The book describes itself as a \"journey into the fractured mirror of modern reality,\" and discusses how Musk and Trump have constructed an alternate reality through obsessive repetition. It was written \"for those who suspect that the world they see is only a shadow of something far more complex,\" its Amazon blurb claims. Xun's thoughts center on \"hypnocracy,\" describing a regime that exerts control through \"algorithmic modulation\" of collective consciousness instead of censorship. In English: fake news. Xun claims that Trump's speeches and social media posts create conditions of uncertainty. Trump \"empties language: his words, repeated endlessly, become empty signifiers, devoid of meaning yet charged with hypnotic power,\" Xun wrote. Xun claims Musk makes promises \u201cdestined not to materialize,\u201d by \u201cflooding our imagination\u201d with ventures such as space colonization and neural interfaces. \"Together they modulate desires, rewrite expectations, colonize the unconscious,\" the AI philosopher wrote. Spokepeople for Musk and Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2.

I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3.

Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used!

Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7.

I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors.

I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier!

Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17.

Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19.

Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20.

This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT.

Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22.

And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Been using them since high school! The amount of junk and buildup that comes off is so satisfying to see! It can be irritating when removing, especially if you have sensitive skin.

I tried this product on a whim\u2026and boy am I glad!! I wash, rinse and dry in the morning and they are dry and ready for use by lunch if I need a touch up. It does take a few minutes but SO WORTH it!! They more I use it, the faster I am getting. My brushes look new after and feel so much better on my skin. My makeup even goes on nicer.

Definitely a great buy at an extremely affordable price. The quality exceeded my expectations. It is so soft, true to size and color, wrinkle-free, and has a well-made zipper at the bottom. There are also ties on the inside to keep your duvet in place. I absolutely LOVE everything about this cover. Can\u2019t wait to get home in my bed after a long, exhausting work shift on my feet. My furbaby loves it too! Thanks Amazon for simplifying my life! \u2764\ufe0f\" \u2014 Theresa Get a set from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in sizes twin\u2013oversized king and in 30 colors). 29.

Now all your books can look like they've been perpetually Wingardium Leviosa-ed! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are so much fun! We ordered the small size, which fits standard hardback books (approximately 5\u20137 hardbacks in my experience). They're a great way to add some extra storage to our very small home, and we've placed them in our hallway so people ask us about them all the time. I'd highly recommend!\" \u2014 LaBuenaVidaMere Get a set of three from Amazon for $23.65 (available in two sizes). 31.

Just attach the clips to both straps in the back, and voila! \u2014 no one can see your bra straps from the front. Amazon Promising review: \"My bra straps spent more time off my shoulders than on them. I have bras that fit perfectly, but the straps are too wide-set or something. I'm so glad I bought these little bra strap clip holders because they've solved the problem. I've used them for three days now, and my straps have not fallen off of my shoulders even once in that time. Amazing! I love them! I put a clip holder on my bra and then put the bra on like a T-shirt \u2014 over my head, put my arms in, then fasten it as usual in the back \u2014 pretty easy. The length of the clip holders are adjustable. I have fully extended them to fit across the back of my 38DD bras. At first it felt a bit odd because it was different, but it doesn't take long to adjust to the feel of it. The strap clip holders do the job, and they are pretty cheap, so give them a try. \" \u2014 Polly Esther Get a set of three from Amazon for $5.97+ (available in eight sets with different colors). 32.

So. Much. Room. There is so much room left in my drawer now that I moved stuff from another drawer and I have an entirely empty drawer in my kitchen now.

Promising review: \"My skin is 100% softer and feels far smoother thanks to this product!!! The difference was noticeable after ONE use, its true. All the grime, rolled up skin, flakes and chucks \u2014 shudder, that was on me??? Everything other customers are saying about how disgusting it is when you see how much dead skin sloughs off is true. I disagree that it only comes off after the first use though \u2014 I have continued to see improvement over the time I've used it, about six weeks, and even some age-related and sun damage discoloration is gone.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

EPCOT The HOKA Bondi 8s are undeniably comfy \u2014 we\u2019re talking marshmallow soles, maximum cushion, all the foot-hugging support you could want. But the truth is that we don\u2019t always wear them in Disney World\u2026 and yeah, we\u2019ve got our reasons. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. First, let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: HOKA Bondi 8s are built for comfort. If you\u2019ve ever worn them, you know that soft landing and pillowy feel underfoot. \u00a9Amazon It\u2019s like walking on memory foam. They\u2019ve got great arch support, a wider base for stability, and that oversized midsole is a lifesaver on long walking days. We totally get why so many people swear by them. In fact, most of our AllEars team lives in their HOKAs when they\u2019re in the parks. Grab them here But here\u2019s the painfully honest truth: they\u2019re chunky. Like, really chunky. And while that\u2019s part of the design (and part of what makes them so comfortable), we can\u2019t help but feel a little\u2026 clunky in them. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but when you\u2019re already sweating through your tank top and trying to get a cute castle photo? Yeah, it matters. \u00a9Amazon We own the Bondi 8s and do wear them \u2014 just not all the time. Especially not when we\u2019re trying to put together a cuter park look. We know, we know, style shouldn\u2019t come before comfort when it comes to Disney shoes, but sometimes we reach for other shoes instead. They\u2019re sleeker, they pair better with our outfits, and even if they don\u2019t treat our feet quite as nicely by hour eight\u2026 we do it anyway. We suffer a little for the \u2018fit. And we\u2019re not proud of it, but we\u2019re being honest here. So let\u2019s weigh the pros and cons: HOKA Bondi 8 Pros: Extreme comfort and support \u2014 seriously, A+ Great for people who need extra cushioning or have foot pain Durable and reliable even after long days in the parks Fit for actual running (or chasing Lightning Lanes) HOKA Bondi 8 Cons: Bulky, heavy look that doesn\u2019t always go with every outfit Can feel a little stiff at first and take up a lot of space in your suitcase Expensive \u2014 if you\u2019re only wearing them for Disney, they\u2019re an investment Let\u2019s talk about the alternative sneakers we\u2019re reaching for: First, we\u2019ve got these New Balance Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s Oxford Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon They\u2019re still cushy but way more streamlined. Plus, they have a fun retro vibe that works with most of my park outfits. Grab them here Next up, we\u2019ve got these Brooks Women\u2019s Adrenaline GTS 23 Supportive Running Shoes : \u00a9Amazon These are solid running shoes with real support. They\u2019re not quite as chunky as the HOKAS but still have that plush, reliable feel. If you want all-day comfort in a slightly more streamlined silhouette, this is a great option. Grab them here Lastly, we\u2019ve got these adidas Women\u2019s Cloudfoam Pure Sportswear Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon If your Disney style leans sporty-chic, these are a great pick. The foam is soft, the fit is flexible, and the design is cute enough to blend with pretty much any park outfit. Grab them here At the end of the day, wear what works for you. If you\u2019re prioritizing function over fashion, HOKAs are probably your best bet. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s fully committed to comfort (you should be!), don\u2019t let the look stop you. \u00a9Amazon But if you\u2019re like us \u2014 balancing comfort with aesthetics, especially when you\u2019ve planned a whole Disney look \u2014 we totally get reaching for a sleeker sneaker even if you know your feet will hate you by dinnertime. And yes, we know this is a hot take. But someone had to say it. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the best Disney essentials, so make sure you stay tuned to AllEars for more!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about lifestyle tech Follow Author Apr 12, 2025, 12:45pm EDT Share Save Comment Updated April 12 with more details of offers and deals. Amazon has new price cuts for iPhones which take select models right back to their Spring Sale lows. The discounts apply to the the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and the iPhone 16 Pro versions, too. In fact, all the phones in the iPhone 16 series are represented apart from the newest of all, the iPhone 16e, which is the most affordable of the range. What\u2019s more, there are bargains to be had if you\u2019d like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, as well. Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus prices are down at Amazon. Getty Images Amazon U.K. has discounted the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max by \u00a3100 or more. The deals highlighted in this post were independently selected by the Contributor and do not contain affiliate links. Forbes Apple Intelligence For iPhone To Add Google Gemini In Weeks, Report Claims By David Phelan Let\u2019s start with the iPhone 16. The entry-level model has 128GB storage and comes in four colors, of which three are discounted in this storage level. Choose between pink, teal and white to find the iPhone with 13% off. That takes the price down by \u00a3101, from \u00a3799 ($1,019) to \u00a3698 ($890). Here\u2019s the link for the iPhone 16. MORE FOR YOU Microsoft\u2019s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users \u2018Worse Than 1971\u2019\u2014U.S. Dollar Price \u2018Collapse\u2019 Predicted To Ignite $22 Trillion Bitcoin Challenge To Gold Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 12th If you\u2019re mad about the Ultramarine color, and I couldn\u2019t blame you, there are savings available if you choose the 512GB version. The regular price for this is \u00a31,099 ($1,402) but it has a 9% discount, which also works out at \u00a3101 off, making it \u00a3998 ($1,273). The same price applies for the pink, teal and white finishes. The fifth color, black, is not worth having at the current Amazon price of \u00a31,202.79 for the 128GB storage model. The iPhone 16 with 256GB storage is also not available. Fancy a bigger screen? The iPhone 16 Plus is discounted by 11%, taking its regular \u00a3899 ($1,147) sticker down by \u00a3101 (spotting a pattern here?) to \u00a3798 ($1,018). You only get to choose the white finish at this price, please note. Here\u2019s the iPhone 16 Plus link . There\u2019s more choice for the 256GB storage option, a 10% discount of \u00a3101 brings the \u00a3999 ($1,275) price down to \u00a3898 ($1,146). All colors except black available. The full range of colors is discounted on the largest storage of 512GB. Down from \u00a31,199 ($1,530) by 8% or, you guessed it, \u00a3101, the new price is \u00a31,098 ($1,401) and you can choose between black, pink, teal, ultramarine and white. If you can\u2019t resist the three cameras and titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro, these are discounted, too. Here\u2019s the link. All four colors are available for the 128GB storage models. That means Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and White Titanium are all 10% off, that means the regular \u00a3999 ($1,308) price is knocked down by \u00a3100 ($131) to \u00a3899 ($1,178). And you\u2019ll notice the magic spell of \u00a3101 off has been broken on this model, though only just. Forbes Apple\u2019s Stealthy New Music Upgrade For Windows PCs Beats Microsoft By David Phelan Same for the 256GB model, which also sees \u00a3100 ($131) off, across the board. Here it\u2019s a 9% discount, taking the \u00a31,099 ($1,439) sticker down to \u00a3999 ($1,308). All four colors available. Step up to 512GB storage and something eerily predictable happens: all four colors available with \u00a3100 ($131) off. This means an 8% price cut, so the regular \u00a31,299 ($1,701) price drops to \u00a31,199 ($1,570). The same \u00a3100 ($131) cut means the regular \u00a31,499 ($1,963) price for the 1TB storage option is \u00a31,399 ($1,832). The biggest phone of all is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a 6.9-inch display. Check this link and you\u2019ll see a wholly unsurprising discount in place. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s \u00a3100 ($131) off the 256GB model \u2014 the lowest-capacity storage option for the Max \u2014 which reduces the price from \u00a31,199 ($1,570) to \u00a31,099 ($1,439), with all colors ready to ship. The 512GB version also (can you believe it?) shows a \u00a3100 ($131) price cut. That\u2019s a 7% discount and brings the regular \u00a31,399 ($1,832) sticker to \u00a31,299 ($1,701. All colors available. The 1TB option, regularly \u00a31,599 ($2,094) down by \u00a3100 ($131), as you may have guessed. This 6% price cut means you\u2019ll pay \u00a31,499 ($1,963). Lastly, there\u2019s the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Last year\u2019s standard iPhones may not have all the love expended on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which arguably took the regular phones closer to the Pro models than before, but they\u2019re still worth considering, especially when the prices are reduced as here. Apple will sell you the iPhone 15 with 128GB storage for \u00a3699. On Amazon ( here\u2019s the link ), all five colors are available for \u00a3598. That\u2019s 14% off and our old friend the $101 discount reappears. The five colors, by the way, are yellow, green, pink, blue and black. Trade up to 256GB and instead of the regular \u00a3799 price you can find all five for \u00a3698. The larger-display iPhone 15 Plus, usually selling for \u00a3799 with 128GB storage, has dropped to \u00a3698, that\u2019s 13% off but only in green and pink. The 256GB storage has dropped from \u00a3899 to, yes, that\u2019s right, \u00a3798, which is an 11% discount. You can choose between blue and black for this deal. The 512GB storage option is available for this larger phone, wih the same \u00a3101 discount, taking the price from \u00a31,099 to \u00a3998. Choose between black and, no, that\u2019s it, just black. Incidentally, if U.S. readers see the price translations and feel the Brits are paying well over the odds compared to prices in the States, remember that U.S. prices are quoted pre-tax and U.K. ones have all sales taxes included, so the disparity isn\u2019t as steep as it looks. And if price rises cut in Stateside because of tariffs, then iPhones could even be cheaper on the other side of the pond one day.

A colorful wireless keyboard and mouse set for adding some joy-inducing color to your workspace without any bothersome cords to tie you down. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com The set includes a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse with a USB receiver. Pick up some AA batteries \u2014 both will need them! Promising review: \"Every time I walk into my red office and see this beautiful keyboard, it makes me happy. It looks just like it does in the photo. It's such a jolt of color, and with its cool circular retro buttons, it's just a pleasure to use. If you need a pick-me-up (and who doesn't this year?), I can't recommend this highly enough.\" \u2014 CA-girl Get it from Amazon for $40.99 (available in 14 styles). 2. An aesthetic flexible power strip so you can actually utilize each and every outlet even when your excessively massive laptop charger is present. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com iJoy is a small business selling a variety of tech accessories, speakers, and headphones. Promising review: \"I rarely write a review (this is the second in the past few years). One of the best purchases in a long time. Nice design and very practical. It solves all of my problems as it can go any direction. It's worth every penny. I turned around and bought two more. I am about to buy my fourth one. Love this!\" \u2014 Pond P. Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in three colors). 3. A ventilated cable management box if you're tired of tangled cords trapping your feet and offending your eyes. Amazon Promising review: \" A must-buy product for your messy home or office. Exactly what I was looking for to help save space and hide my cable cords.\" \u2014 Andrew Olson Get it from Amazon for $15.99 . 4. An ergonomic nonslip mouse pad because it's the wrist-aligning support system you need to fire off hot takes on Slack with minimal pain and discomfort. www.amazon.com Read more about how an ergonomic mouse can help prevent carpal tunnel at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"The design is gorgeous and so comfy that I even take it when I travel for business. This has relieved wrist pain from working on the computer every day.\" \u2014 Bianka P Gonzalez G Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in 21 patterns). 5. A 52-sheet to-do list pad for when you're overwhelmed with all the things that need doing and just don't know where to start. Blank legal pads do not inspire, but this cutie sure does! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I LOVE this product! I live off lists every day at work, and this keeps me super organized! I have my daily list, top three priorities, things I need to remember for the next day, and miscellaneous notes all on the same page!\" \u2014 Ldsappy Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in six colors/styles). 6. A USB-powered LED light strip to give your desk area a futuristic glow while working double-duty to reduce eye fatigue and hopefully keep those pesky headaches at bay when you're pulling extra long shifts. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have procrastinated in writing this review and am actually happy to say that after a year, the product is continuing to stay strong. The adhesion is as strong as it was on day one, and this product continues to meet and exceed expectations. I have noticed significantly less eye strain. If I were needing computer monitor backlighting again, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase. \" \u2014 college_engineer Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes). 7. A cooling memory foam seat cushion that's unassuming enough to blend in with most any desk chair and will make you feel ~supported~ even on your longest days. www.amazon.com The velour cover zips off for easy cleaning in the washing machine. Promising review: \"I've purchased similar items in the past that visually looked like this but were stiff and rigid. This is amazing. Totally eased my back pain from my quarantine-at-home desk job . Highly recommend.\" \u2014 Bellarosa555 Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in seven colors). 8. Or a whimsical paw chair cushion so you can add an extra layer of comfort *and* cuteness to cradle your booty while you're on the clock. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Got this for my office desk. It definitely stands out, and the older ladies at my work love it! It works well as a seat cushion, as my office chair is so thin I can feel the metal and plastic bits when sitting. With the cushion, it's super soft and comfortable!\" \u2014 Jane Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). 9. An electric mug warmer because nothing ruins your cozy desk vibes quite like reaching for your coffee only to find it's gone cold. With this chic little warmer, you can join the slow sippers club without having to make a bazillion trips to the microwave. If this seems like one big fire hazard to you \u2014 fear not \u2014 there's a built-in auto shutoff! Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Reviewers suggest turning the heat down from high to medium once the drink gets down to about the halfway point so it stays a comfortable temperature! Check it out on TikTok (where one reviewer even has the genius idea to use it as a candle warmer at their desk, too)! BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes wishes she had bought it sooner: \"After seeing this coffee warmer all over BuzzFeed Shopping and even gifting my dad one for Christmas, I finally decided to buy one for myself. Based on all the reviews, I was pretty confident I'd soon be kicking myself for not getting it sooner, and that proved to be true: This thing not only looks good but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long. (Because yes, I'm one of those people who'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!) I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste. Also, I looove how sleek the white version looks on my white desk, and the auto-shutoff function is a nice safety feature for an absent-minded person.\" Get it from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in nine styles). 10. A slim desktop whiteboard if your desk is littered with distracting sticky notes that always seem to get lost anyway. This memo board is designed to fit comfortably between a keyboard and a monitor, creating a designated place where you can write out all your absolutely-cannot-forget reminders again and again and again. www.amazon.com The whiteboard also comes with a dry-erase marker, an accessory channel (to hold the marker), and a storage drawer. Promising review: \"Never thought something analog would be SO useful in my daily routine. I work from home and am constantly project managing a number of complex strategic projects. Having pertinent information directly in front of me and top of mind has done incredible things for my productivity . Never would have imagined it would make such a difference. For a nominal investment, I highly recommend it if you have trouble keeping up with things.\" \u2014 Captainflapjax Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in four styles). 11. Or a wall-mounted acrylic dry-erase board for a major aesthetic upgrade to standard dry erase boards with all the same schedule-tracking, note-taking, and organizing prowess. 1801 & Co. / Etsy 1801 & Co. is a Minnesota-based Etsy shop established in 2016 that specializes in family wall calendars, chore charts, wedding signs, and more. Promising review : \"I love it! I got it so fast after ordering, and it\u2019s perfect . I love the sleek design for my small home office space. I can\u2019t function at work without a dry erase board but couldn\u2019t find any that would look nice in my office space, which is in the corner of my master bedroom! Having functional office space without LOOKING like an office in the bedroom is challenging, but this acrylic board is PERFECT. The black pen that comes with it is very nice fine tip and erases without a trace.\" \u2014 Dawn Powell Get it from 1801 & Co. on Etsy for $32.73+ (available in 19 sizes and three hardware styles/finishes). 12. A jumbo printed desk pad to cover up all those stains, chips, and scratches (How'd those even get there?) with any one of a vast collection of colors and patterns to suit any taste. Plus, you'll LOVE all the free-range mouse movin' you can do with all this newfound space. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really like this mat \u2014 I've had it for several months now, and it hasn't faded or scuffed at all. Makes my basic office cubicle desk a little prettier and does the job I really needed it for \u2014 to soften the surface of my desk because I hate the way my mouse sounds without a mousepad. Several coworkers have complimented the design and asked for the link! \" \u2014 AliB_Art Get it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in 24 colors/prints). 13. Super pretty rainbow prism sun catchers so you can bask in sunny rainbows even if you're stuck inside working. Who can't help but smile at a rainbow?! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I put two of these in my home office window, where the sun shines in the morning. Every morning, it's an explosion of cheerful rainbows and sunshine, and it just makes me happy to be alive! The quality is excellent. Even though they aren't crystal, I honestly don't think you would ever see a difference if they were, other than being a few hundred dollars poorer. They are heavy, remarkably clear, smooth, crisp facets, and appear flawless.\" \u2014 Dr Hall Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.98 . 14. A capybara desk companion that'll just about force a smile out of you whenever it catches your eye, even when Jake from IT is getting on your last nerve.

A precious little mushroom lamp if you're short on space but big on your love for all things cottagecore. This lovely little mush casts a soft glow across your desk, with 16 colors and four brightness levels easily controlled with a remote. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"Cute, cute, cute! This is one of the cutest night-lights ever! Not only does it change colors, but it can also be controlled remotely and changed in a variety of colors and effects, from flashing to slowly fading from one color into another, or if desired, one constant color to match any decor. The brightness can also be adjusted. And the wood base gives it more than the look of a toy; it is perfectly classy.\" \u2014 roika Get it from Amazon for $22.99 . 16. A space-efficient bamboo multi-device charging dock for corralling the sprawling mess of tech and chargers into one designated display that practically doubles as decor. www.amazon.com Great Useful Stuff is a Utah-based small business selling a tight selection of home and lifestyle goods that embody the brand's name. Promising review: \"My desk was full of chargers and cords. This really helps keep everything organized and puts those cords out of sight. I also use the dividers to store a notebook, so you can use it for other things besides computers, phones, etc. I also really like the material. I got the light bamboo.\" \u2014 Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $48 (available in four other styles). 17. A tufted height-adjustable swivel chair to bring a warm sense of cozy into your WFH cubicle that almost looks too good to be considered so comfortable by so many reviewers. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is great. The chair is perfect. I bought this as my desk chair and it\u2019s awesome. The set up is very easy and quick. It\u2019s also very comfortable. It looks exactly as pictured.

This little guy has a majorly big mouth that's perfect for stashing sweets, keys, or anything else that might need a fearsome protector. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Honestly better than I thought it would be. It looked cool online, and I bought it as an impulse buy and was not disappointed. It's heavy and well-made. If I had any complaint, it's that due to the shape of the jaw, some jelly beans fall out if I don't grab them carefully, but I've decided that's a small price to pay for this epic protector sitting on my desk.\" \u2014 David Get it from Amazon for $44.98+ (available in three colors). 25.
